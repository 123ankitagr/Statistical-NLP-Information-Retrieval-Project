CHRISTIANI and Nielsen (Thai), the Thai construction company, is planning to
take control of its Danish parent Christiani and Nielsen and move the
group's headquarters to Bangkok in what is thought to be the first such
'reverse takeover' of its kind in Thailand.
The move, confirmed by the Thai company yesterday, reflects the increasing
strength of the subsidiary compared with its ailing Danish par-ent.
One stockbroker in Thailand said yesterday: 'Official concerns are that
given the weakness of the parent company it might be open to some kind of
hostile takeover.'
Christiani and Nielsen (Thai), which is 42.17 per cent owned by the Danish
parent, declined to give financial details of the proposed deal yesterday.
Company executives in Bangkok said an announcement was expected in the next
few days, following delays caused by the unfamiliarity of Thai accountants
and advisers with such a transaction and by the slowness of the Stock
Exchange of Thailand in granting its approval.
Christiani and Nielsen (Thai) shares have been suspended at Bt129 - which
values the Thai company at about Dollars 230m - since it announced an
unidentified takeover plan in September.
Mr Peter Kirketerp, financial controller of the Thai unit, said yesterday
there were no plans to cease operations in Europe. 'Certainly not, if it's
up to us,' he said.
'We want to put some gas into it.'
He added: 'It does make commercial sense. It does give access to resources
which this company does not have at the moment . . . I think it's a bit
unusual - the first time that a Thai company is taking over its parent.'
