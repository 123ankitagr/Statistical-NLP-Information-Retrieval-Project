Roy Gardener, the seasoned Portals manager responsible for revamping JR
Crompton, the teabag papermaker acquired from the Bunzl group in 1990, is
stepping aside from the start of January, thus
triggering a management reshuffle.
Gardener, 54, who has spent the past four years as Crompton's managing
director and has overseen a substantial improvement in productivity and
profits, is to undertake a number of special assignments within Portals'
core security and specialist papermaking division.
He will also continue as a member of Portal's papermaking divisional board
and as a Crompton director, but will be succeeded as Crompton managing
director by Nick Acland, 33.
Acland, who has an MBA from Insead, is moving over from Portals (Bathford),
which makes watermarked high security paper for non-currency security
documents including the new DSS high security covers for pension and other
allowance books. Acland has been managing director there for the past four
years.
Keith Brown, 37, will become managing director of Portals (Bathford) which
is a world leader in its market. He will bring to the company broad
strategic skills and papermaking experience, which includes the integration
phase and subsequent growth at Crompton where he has been a director for
three years.
