Treasury Bill Rates Rise: Interest rates on 52-week T-bills rose to the highest level since June. The Treasury Department sold $9.3 billion of the bills at an average discount rate of 7.68%, up from 7.22% at the last comparable auction July 27. The rates were the highest since June 1, when the one-year bills sold for 8.18%. The new discount rate understates the actual return to investors -- 8.27%, with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,223.50.
