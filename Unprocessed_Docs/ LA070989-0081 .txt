Leading experts on innovative kitchens and bath design will provide up-to-date information on style, equipment and surfacing materials at a symposium Saturday at UCLA. 
The all-day meeting in Room 147, Dodd Hall, is aimed at professional designers and architects, students and homeowners. 
Creating color palettes in kitchens and baths will be discussed by Carleton Wagner, psychologist and director of the Institute for Color Research, who will show how moods can be created by proper color selection. 
The latest space designs, equipment, color, lighting and finishes for new or remodeled homes will be part of an illustrated presentation by Stephen Mead, bathroom designer and author of several books on bath design. 
Don O'Connor, one of the foremost authors and instructors in kitchen design, will discuss the expansion of kitchen-cabinet storage to other areas in the home as a versatile and viable solution.
