The Rev. Jesse Jackson told hundreds of people in this impoverished black township Thursday that their struggle to win civil rights from the white-led government has inspired hope around the world. 
Touring Soweto on the second day of his 12-day visit to South Africa, the black U.S. civil rights leader walked down streets of ramshackle squatters' huts, stopped at a day-care center, visited the home of African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu and spoke to township teachers. 
At the Orlando Home and Creche, a day-care center, Jackson took preschool children on his knee and posed for pictures under a banner reading, "Welcome Baba Jesse Jackson. . . . We Love You Very, Very Much." 
"Baba" is a term of respect. 
Echoing speeches he made on the campaign trail during the 1988 presidential race, Jackson roared to youths gathered outside Sisulu's home: "Keep your head high! Keep hope alive!" 
Jackson listened as Sisulu led a crowd of 100 in singing the hymn "God Bless Africa," which black nationalists hope will become the national anthem. 
"You've inspired hope around the world," Jackson declared. "It's so good to see you express your will to be free, and to see you determined to put hope in your heart and hope in your brains, and not dope in your veins."
