Washington State junior running back Rich Swinton, who is serving two years' probation for a misdemeanor assault, was suspended from the team indefinitely after being cited last week for driving with a suspended license and without Washington plates. 
"Normally, Washington State University football players would not be suspended for a traffic violation," Coach Mike Price said in a prepared statment. "Rich's problems have been unique and I find it imperative to discipline him now."
