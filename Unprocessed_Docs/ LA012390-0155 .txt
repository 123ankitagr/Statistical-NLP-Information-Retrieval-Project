The FBI today released a photograph of the "Mr. McGoo Bandit," believed to have staged five bank robberies in Orange County during the last year. 
Dubbed "Mr. McGoo" because of his thick glasses and his resemblance to the popular cartoon character, the bandit struck again a week ago, robbing the Laguna Hills branch of the Wells Fargo Bank, the FBI said. 
FBI officials say investigators have linked the bandit to the robbery of the Household Bank in Westminster on Jan. 30, 1989. Since then, officials said, he has also robbed the Wells Fargo Bank in El Toro and is believed to be responsible for two robberies within a week at a Western Federal Savings & Loan office in Seal Beach last year. An FBI spokesman declined to disclose the amount of cash taken. 
Agents describe "Mr. McGoo" as being about 60 to 65 years old; weighing 165 pounds; 5 feet, 8 inches tall with brown graying hair balding in front. He has a tattoo on his right forearm. 
Anyone with information about "Mr. McGoo" is asked to call the FBI at (714) 542-8825 or (213) 477-6565.
