UC Irvine's Extension program has won a national award for excellence in promoting continuing education. 
The National University Continuing Education Assn., at its recent annual conference in Salt Lake City, honored UCI for a color print advertisement designed by UCI Extension. The ad, which promoted continuing education, was created by copywriter Judy Lloyd and art director Ellen Laning. 
The UCI entry won the award after vying against 500 other entries in the marketing and promotion division of the association's annual competition.
