A man who died in the crash of a single-engine plane on a training flight near Castaic was identified as Alfredo Arevalo, 43, of North Hollywood, the Los Angeles County coroner's office reported Wednesday. 
The pilot of the two-seat Cessna, Anthony Cornejo, 22, of Los Angeles, was injured in the Tuesday crash and was recovering Wednesday at Holy Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills. Hospital spokeswoman Pamela Kouba said he was in good condition. 
National Transportation Safety Board officials were investigating the crash Wednesday but had not determined its cause, a board spokesman said. 
The plane took off from Whiteman Airport in Pacoima shortly after 9 a.m. Tuesday, said Joe Silva, Los Angeles County Fire Department inspector. An employee of a nearby power plant discovered the wreckage on a steep mountainside about 3:45 p.m. and notified authorities.
