India's Supreme Court reserved judgment today on challenges to a $470-million compensation award for victims of the world's worst industrial accident after lobby groups said the settlement is insultingly low. 
The Indian government has backed the appeal by lobbyists for people who lost relatives or became ill after a pesticides plant owned by an Indian subsidiary of Union Carbide Corp., based in Danbury, Conn., spewed poison gas on the central Indian city of Bhopal on Dec. 3, 1984. 
The lobbies allege the award was unjust and are demanding up to $3 billion from the company.
