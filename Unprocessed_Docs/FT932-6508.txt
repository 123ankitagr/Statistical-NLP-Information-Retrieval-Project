GERMANY'S coalition government yesterday approved a proposal to ease tight
restrictions on genetic engineering research.
The proposed amendment to the three-year-old law regulating gene technology
research, will remove lengthy and costly procedures which had forced the
pharmaceutical industry to conduct most of its research outside Germany.
'At the moment, every single genetic experiment requires a series of
de-tailed documents in order to receive permission. This is greatly
handicapping the competitiveness of German research laboratories,' said Mr
Gehrad Stopa, spokesman for Bayer, the chemical group.
The amendment introduces simpler registration procedures for research
classified as safe for the natural and human environment.
Over 75 per cent of genetic engineering research falls into this category
and could benefit from the amendment.
Mr Gunter Rexrodt, the economics minister, said yesterday the proposal was
crucial to ensure that German pharmaceutical laboratories were competitive
with those of other countries, especially the US.
The amendment will go to parliament later this year.
