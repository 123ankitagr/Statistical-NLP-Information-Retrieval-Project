Sir, Thomas Mayer (Personal View, June 1) is right to warn of the dangers of
excessive growth in German M3 and public borrowing, but he overstates the
case.
Mr Mayer compares M3 growth of 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993 with real
gross domestic product growth of 19 per cent (giving an implied money
overhang of 27 per cent). However, the appropriate comparison is with
nominal GDP, which grew by more than 39 per cent. In other words, past
inflation has already absorbed much of the excessive M3 growth, leaving an
overhang of only about 7 per cent.
He notes that at the end of this year, public debt will be 115 per cent
higher than at the end of 1989. This overstates the upward trend in public
borrowing, because it includes existing GDR net debt, which we estimate at
DM450bn, or 48.5 per cent of the level of public debt in 1989.
Mr Mayer rightly warns that credit is expanding faster than investment, but
he overstates the problem by citing the 4 per cent fall in equipment
investment between 1989 and 1993. Most investment has recently been
concentrated in construction, especially desperately needed housing.
Including this, nominal investment rose 26 per cent in the west during that
period. The figure would be higher still if we add in investment in the
east.
There should be no question of the Bundesbank's abandoning the M3 target -
its current rapid growth and the surge in credit provide a signal of
potential risks ahead. But those risks should not be exaggerated.
