Felix S. Bloch, the U.S. diplomat suspected of spying for the Soviet Union, told FBI agents he had been paid "a lot of money" by the Soviet KGB security and intelligence agency during a relationship of "many years," the New York Times reported in today's editions. 
Bloch's reported admissions came in his one brief interview with the FBI on June 22, the newspaper said, citing an "official involved in the case" as its source. 
Informed of this report, three Administration sources familiar with the Bloch case said in Washington on Thursday night that they had not been told of such admissions. 
Bloch reportedly refused to discuss with the FBI any possible spying activities or his motives.
