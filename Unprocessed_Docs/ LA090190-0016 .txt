I want you to know that I tried, really tried, to learn to tolerate Reggie Jackson as the color man on KTLA's Angel telecasts, but it just can't be done. The guy never shuts up, with every inane pronouncement handed down as if from Moses coming off the mountain. 
Reggie Jackson was a fine ballplayer, but as a broadcaster he is a disaster.
