Daiei, Japan's largest supermarket chain, has linked with Agfa-Gevaert, the
German photographic film maker, in an attempt to break into Japan's tightly
held film market with an inexpensive German-made product branded under its
own name, writes William Dawkins in Tokyo.
The film will retail at a 60 per cent discount to average photographic film
prices, said a Daiei spokesman. On the strength of this the company Daiei is
planning to achieve a market share of around a 3 per cent in the first year.
Currently, the Japanese photographic film market is dominated by Fuji, with
a 70 per cent share, followed by Kodak and Konika with just under 30 per
cent combined, and Agfa-Gevaert with less than 1 per cent.
