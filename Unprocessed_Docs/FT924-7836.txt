FRANCE'S ruling Socialists yesterday rallied behind party leader Mr Laurent
Fabius vowing they would not let him be made a scapegoat over Aids-infected
blood transfusions, Reuter reports from Paris.
Mr Fabius, who was prime minister in 1985, when more than 1,200
haemophiliacs were infected by transfusions from state blood banks, told
party colleagues he would not resign.
The opposition has demanded that Mr Fabius and former health ministers Mr
Edmon Herve and Ms Georgina Dufoix stand trial.
