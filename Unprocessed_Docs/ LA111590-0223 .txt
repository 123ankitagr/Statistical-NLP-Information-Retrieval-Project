What's in a Name?: It's ciao to Ciao, the name given to two Italian-style restaurants in Santa Ana and Dana Point. The restaurants will remain under the same management, but a new name must be found. 
The five Crivello brothers opened their restaurant in 1986, choosing the Italian word for farewell as its name. Appropriate as it might be, the name was hardly original. A Northern California restaurant chain of the same name took offense. 
So the brothers have decided to make "fine wine out of sour grapes," as Vince Crivello puts it, with a name contest. 
The winner of the contest will receive an Italian feast for up to 10 people. Entries should be sent no later than Dec. 7 to So Long, Farewell, Ciao, 249 Grenada Ave., Long Beach, Calif. 90803.
