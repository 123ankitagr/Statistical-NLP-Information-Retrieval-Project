A Korean Air pilot has been sentenced to two years in prison for causing a crash that killed 80 people in Libya last year. 
Kim Ho-joon, 54, was found guilty last week by the Seoul Criminal Court of neglecting his duty as captain of the DC-10 that crashed at Tripoli Airport on July 27, 1989, with 119 people aboard. 
The pilot was accused of trying to land in thick fog without analyzing weather information.
