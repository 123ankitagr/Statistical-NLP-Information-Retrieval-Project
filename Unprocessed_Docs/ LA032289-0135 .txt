Women who smoke marijuana during pregnancy may stunt the growth of their fetuses, producing babies who are smaller than normal, according to a study released today. 
The research found that mothers who smoked pot while pregnant produced babies who averaged three ounces lighter and two-tenths of an inch shorter than non-users' newborns. Although their study does not definitely prove that marijuana slows growth in the womb, the researchers said pot-smoking is common during pregnancy and women should be cautioned about the link. The study also confirmed earlier reports showing that cocaine users produce unusually small babies.
