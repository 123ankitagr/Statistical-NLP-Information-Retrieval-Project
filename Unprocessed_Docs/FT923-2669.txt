MR DONALD Bainton, who resigned as president of Continental Can nine years
ago after a disagreement over strategy, is getting belated revenge by buying
back the name of the largely dismembered group from its current owner, the
diversified Pieter Kiewit group.
Mr Bainton will use Continental Can as the new name for Viatech, a packaging
company with significant European interests which he has built up since the
mid-1980s. Mr Bainton and his brother hold 42 per cent of Viatech's stock.
He also announced that Viatech, which is quoted on the American Stock
Exchange, would seek a listing under its new name on the larger New York
Stock Exchange.
The company has also signed an agreement to raise from 50 per cent to 100
per cent its stake in Plastic Containers, a joint venture with Merrywood,
which is controlled by Mexico's Zapata packaging family.
Plastic Containers is a vehicle used in 1991 for the Dollars 153m purchase
of Continental Plastic Containers, a US company which is the last remaining
packaging unit of the old Continental Can company.
Under the deal Merrywood can, after July 1994, exchange its stake in Plastic
Containers for 887,500 shares of Viatech or put the stake to Viatech for
Dollars 30m, its original cost, plus interest.
