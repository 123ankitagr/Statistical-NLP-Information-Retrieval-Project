European rum importers have been cancelling orders from Caribbean suppliers
because the current import quota will soon be filled, according to Caribbean
exporters.
The European rum market faces two months of dislocation because the European
Union has refused to increase the quota to meet growing demand for the
product, producers say.
The exporters have failed several times to have the European Commission
increase the quota of 224,000 hectolitres by 25,000hl to meet demand in
Europe. The quota year is to expire next month.
An increase in the rum quota is not a priority for the Commission, Mr
Philippe Soubestre, deputy director-general for development, said in
Barbados. He said it was paying more attention to the EU's political
problems.
Conditions for access to the European rum market come in a protocol of the
Lome Convention, a trade and aid treaty of the EU and the African, Caribbean
and Pacific group of countries. Rum producers have criticised the EU for
being slow to honour commitments to react automatically by raising access
for rum to meet a growing demand.
'This is a disgraceful situation,' a leading producer said yesterday. 'There
is paranoia in Europe over this matter. No-one wants to upset the French,
who are leading the campaign against an increase in quota to protect
domestic producers in their Caribbean departments.'
