A New Zealand man convicted of beating his wife found an unusual supporter at an Auckland court -- his mother-in-law. 
"I don't think he deserves a sentence. He deserves a medal," she told Otahuhu District Judge David Harvey. "He has literally been through hell." 
The woman said her daughter had driven the 36-year-old man, whose name was withheld, to extremes and that if there was any trouble, "she would've asked for it." 
Harvey, who conceded that the defendant was "the recipient of a considerable amount of verbal and psychological abuse," sentenced him to supervision for one year and ordered that he have anger and stress management counseling.
