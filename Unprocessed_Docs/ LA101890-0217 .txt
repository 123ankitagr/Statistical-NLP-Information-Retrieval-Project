A man wanted in connection with a bank robbery in Cleveland, Ohio, two months ago was arrested Wednesday at an apartment complex here, an FBI spokesman said. 
Terrance Gray, 24, was being held in Orange County Jail without bail pending an appearance before a U.S. magistrate today on suspicion of bank robbery, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
Gray was identified as a suspect after a Cleveland TV station broadcast a photograph taken during the bank robbery in which $3,591 was taken, Cox said. A viewer recognized the photo and contacted the FBI, he said. 
Garden Grove police investigators developed leads on Gray's location in Orange County, Cox said, declining to elaborate. 
FBI agents arrested Gray as he drove into the parking lot of a Fullerton apartment complex, Cox said.
