Who stands to lose the most from Australia's rejection of the conservative
opposition parties in Saturday's general election? The answer is probably
not John Hewson, the luckless conservative leader, but Kerry Packer,
Australia's richest gambler.
In the past, Packer has made money under both Labor and conservative
governments. But the latest election result means there will be no change in
Australia's banking and media laws. That is bad news for Packer, who owns 10
per cent of Westpac Banking Corporation, and has recently acquired 5 per
cent of Fairfax - Conrad Black's Australian newspaper group.
Packer would like to bid for both groups, but is prevented by Labor
legislation which limits him to 15 per cent of each. He could have a tilt at
Fairfax if he sold the Channel Nine television operation, but that would
mean giving up control of Australia's top-rated tv channel, which is also a
big money-spinner.
However, Packer has been dealt worse hands before and come up trumps. He is
still showing a profit on his Westpac punt, and the underlying profitability
at Fairfax suggests he isn't going to lose a fortune there. Nevertheless, it
would be surprising if Packer were content to remain a passive investor for
long.
Although Westpac doesn't want Kerry on its board, perhaps Conrad Black
should hedge his bets by inviting him to join his Fairfax board. Even Black
might feel happier with Kerry on the inside.
