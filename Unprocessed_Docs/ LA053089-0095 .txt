Two armed men in ski masks forced their way into the office at a miniature golf course Monday morning, tied up the assistant manager and made off with $11,000 in cash and the assistant manager's pickup truck, police reported. 
The assistant manager, Steve D. White of Fountain Valley, was released by other employees, who found White bound to a post in the video arcade at the Family Fun Center on Magnolia Street at the San Diego Freeway. 
The holdup occurred shortly after 7 a.m., when White arrived at work, police said. They quoted White as saying he heard knocks at the door, thought they came from employees appearing for work and opened the door. 
Instead, there were two disguised men armed with handguns who forced White to open the office safe.
