U.S. Ambassador Henry Grunwald confirmed today he has resigned from his post, saying it is for purely personal reasons. 
Grunwald said he told the U.S. government he will end his duties in January and return to private life in the United States. "I did so with regret and purely personal reasons," said Grunwald, former editor-in-chief of Time magazine. 
Grunwald, a Viennese-born Jew, fled Austria with his family after its annexation by Nazi Germany in 1938. 
At Time he worked his way from copy boy to foreign editor and finally to top management. He was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan to succeed Ronald Lauder as ambassador to Austria in 1988.
