THE River Tees between Stockton and Middlesbrough was diverted yesterday as
part of the construction work on the Pounds 47m Tees barrage, Chris Tighe
writes.
An earthbank 'plug' edging the river was removed by excavator, allowing the
water to gush into a newly built 400- metre navigation channel through which
it will flow until the barrage is completed in two years.
Next week an upstream 'plug' will be also be removed, completing the
temporary diversion of the river at a point where it is more than 60 metres
wide. The changed course of the river will allow Tarmac, the contractors for
the barrage, to drain the riverbed and build the barrage in the dry.
Mr John Franklin, Tarmac project manager, said: 'It's very unusual to divert
a river of this magnitude. Normally you don't have enough room beside a
river to divert it.'
The diverting of the Tees was financially viable, he added, because a
navigation channel is part of the scheme.
The project, funded by the Teesside Development Corporation, will raise the
level of the Tees at Stockton, covering mudflats, creating leisure
facilities and providing a new road crossing. It will also feed canals cut
through the adjacent Teesdale site, scene of Mrs Thatcher's celebrated 'walk
in the wilderness' in 1987 and now targeted by the TDC for Pounds 500m
public and private investment.
