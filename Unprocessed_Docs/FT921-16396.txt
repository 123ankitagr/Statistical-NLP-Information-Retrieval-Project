Gold closed down on the London bullion market, but off the day's low after a
late rally in silver. Early selling from Frankfurt and Middle East sources
pushed gold down but it met strong support at Dollars 350 a troy ounce and
then clawed back losses as silver hit a three-week high. Gold lacks clear
direction, but a clearer trend is likely to emerge on Monday, when many
operators return from holiday. Talk that liquidated Soviet swaps formed part
of the morning's sales could not be confirmed. Comex gold futures hit 3 1/2 month lows in early trading, while silver futures rallied strongly on short
covering by three big US funds. The New York rally lifted London silver,
which met resistance as it approached 400 cents a troy ounce. The market was
also underpinned by the firmer tone in international equity markets and by
recent industrial demand. London robusta coffee prices were in retreat while
New York arabicas were ahead at midday. 'New York and London are going in
two different directions at the moment ..if New York manages to hold above
78.50 cents in March, then we could see some more speculator buying. In
London, if it is fund selling, that usually comes in two or three waves,
which could see the market fall further,' one dealer said.
