A GROUP of US investors in Trump Taj Mahal, the debt-laden Atlantic City
casino, has agreed with Mr Donald Trump, the New York property developer, to
put together a restructuring of the Taj Mahal's debt and equity securities.
The move will allow Mr Trump to buy the remaining partnership interests in
the casino that he does not already own. It will also satisfy debt
obligations of the Taj Mahal Associates company, which owns the casino, and
reduce Mr Trump's considerable personal debts.
Mr Trump built the Taj Mahal in 1990 just as his group's finances began to
crumble and the local gaming market began to deteriorate.
The central purpose of the deal is to reduce the Taj Mahal's Dollars 828m in
long-term debt and guaranteed obligations. Under the terms of the
restructuring, that figure will be reduced to about Dollars 692m of
long-term debt once the deal is concluded next March.
