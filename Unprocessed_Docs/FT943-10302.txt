Investcorp, the international investment bank, said yesterday it has agreed
to acquire Star Market, a leading chain of supermarkets in Boston,
Massachusetts, from American Company Stores for Dollars 285m in cash.
Investcorp will later sell a portion of the equity to its largely
Bahrain-based shareholders. Mr Henry Nasella, a former president of the
retail chain, will also be an equity partner in Star Market as well as
manager of its operations.
Mr Nasella, 47, had most recently been president of Staples, a leading US
office supply retailer where he had overseen its rapid growth from revenues
of Dollars 30m in 1987 to Dollars 1bn in 1993.
Star Market's turnover in 1993 was Dollars 840m. It operates 33 stores and
employs over 7,000 people.
Investcorp has other significant investments in North America including Saks
Fifth Avenue, Camelot Music, Color Tile and Tiffany. It has also recently
purchased the 50 per cent of Gucci it did not own.
The bank's main business is purchasing companies, overseeing their growth
and selling them profitably, typically within five years.
It has begun to appoint a post-acquisition committee to oversee the
management of each new acquisition to ensure proper growth.
