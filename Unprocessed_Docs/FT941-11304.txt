Amcor, the Australian paper group, yesterday announced an asset swap deal
between its Montreal-based Twinpak subsidiary and Ontario-based Bonar.
Twinpak will shed its North American paper sack and industrial plastic bags
manufacturing business, but take on the bulk of Bonar's coating and
laminating business in eastern Canada. Amcor declined to disclose sales of
the businesses involved.
The Australian company also announced that it had agreed to acquire a small
plastic bottle manufacturing plant in New York State, its first move into
the US. Amcor has been steadily building an international operation
recently.
