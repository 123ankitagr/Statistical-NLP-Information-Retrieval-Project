The chancellor yesterday fulfilled his commitment to a 3 per cent real
increase in tax on tobacco to support the government's aim of reducing
smoking.
From 6pm last night, tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the
chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a
similar proportion.
However, the tax on beer, table wine and spirits was left unchanged as the
chancellor responded to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and
the increase in cross-Channel shopping and smuggling.
The chancellor reduced the duty on fortified wine by 13p per bottle and on
sparkling wine by 27p to bring the two duties into line with each other.
Mr Kenneth Clarke's action on beer was largely expected as a Treasury select
committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to
curb cross-Channel imports.
In his speech, Mr Clarke said cross-border shopping and smuggling had 'meant
a loss of duty to the exchequer'. He said that 'no chancellor can remain
unmoved in the face of this, but neither can any chancellor simply adopt
popular measures to cut taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue'.
