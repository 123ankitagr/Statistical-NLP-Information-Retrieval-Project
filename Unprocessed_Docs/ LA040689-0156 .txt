Jeremy Sherman's two-run double sparked a four-run sixth inning Wednesday to lead Katella High School to a 5-3 Empire League baseball victory at El Dorado. 
The Knights (8-4 overall, 4-0 in league play), ranked eighth in the Orange County Sportswriters' Assn. poll, trailed fourth-ranked El Dorado, 3-1, when a single by Ken Peters and two errors loaded the bases with one out in the sixth. Sherman then tied the score with his double. 
El Dorado starter Pete Janicki (1-1) intentionally walked Bill Fitzgerald to load the bases again, and then ran the count to 3-0 on Jess Evans. El Dorado Coach Steve Gullotti replaced him at that point with Travis Dowdell, who threw the fourth ball to Evans to give Katella the lead. 
Brandon Boone's sacrifice gave Katella its fourth run of the inning. 
El Dorado, which took a 1-0 lead in the third, saw Katella tie the game on Sherman's fourth-inning home run. The Hawks regained the lead, 3-1, in the fifth on Shane Borowski's solo home run and Dave Moore's run-scoring double. AL PRESTON
