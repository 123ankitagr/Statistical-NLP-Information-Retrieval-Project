Sir, Clement Crisp draws attention to two simultaneous productions of The
Nutcracker in London this Christmas season ('The FT Christmas show guide',
November 19). The necessity for this arises from the fact that both the
Birmingham Royal Ballet and the London Coliseum are only available during
this period. The alternative would be to deprive London audiences of
experiencing Peter Wright's glorious production.
Incidentally, Clement Crisp refers to New York City Ballet's Nutcracker and
omits to mention that the same ballet is being presented simultaneously in
New York by the American Ballet Theatre.
