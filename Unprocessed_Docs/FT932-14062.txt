South Korea will rely on the US and China to solve the North Korean nuclear
weapons issue instead of holding direct contacts with Pyongyang, officials
in Seoul said yesterday, writes John Burton in Seoul.
Seoul believes the US will propose a meeting with North Korea in mid-May
after the UN Security Council issues a resolution condemning Pyongyang's
withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty which takes effect on
June 12. Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, is expected to hold
talks today in Bangkok with Mr Qian Qichen, his Chinese counterpart, on
Beijing's help in arranging the US-North Korean meeting.
