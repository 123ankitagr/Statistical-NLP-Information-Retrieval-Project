Dentsu, Japan's largest advertising agency, yesterday reported its third
year of profit decline, due to continued cuts in corporate advertising.
Pre-tax profits fell 16.7 per cent to Y13.1bn (Dollars 125m) in the 12
months to March, on sales down 4 per cent to Y1,196bn, the second year of
declining turnover.
Dentsu said large clients in basic industries ranging from motor vehicles
and appliances to banks and securities firms had reduced advertising budgets
in response to the adverse economic climate. Television advertising revenues
declined by 2.9 per cent, while newspaper advertising was down 6.2 per cent.
Magazine and radio advertising also fell.
For the current fiscal year, however, Dentsu, which is unlisted, projects a
4 per cent rise in sales to Y1,164bn.
According to the company, big sporting events in 1994, such as World Cup
soccer this summer in the US and the Asian Games this autumn in Hiroshima,
will generate substantial advertising revenues for the firm. In addition,
Japanese industry is assuming a more confident tone.
