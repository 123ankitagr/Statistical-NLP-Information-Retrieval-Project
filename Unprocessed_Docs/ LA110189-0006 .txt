A discussion of procedures to be used in two months or more of Proposition 103 implementation hearings by the state Department of Insurance concluded in San Bruno, three days earlier than planned. Both insurance industry lawyers and consumer representatives had shown signs that they wanted to get on with the more important issues of possible rate rollbacks and changes in pricing methods. Chief hearing judge William J. Fernandez expressed gratitude for the progress made so far and signed a final order setting out briefing schedules, rules for legal discovery of insurance company rating data and compensation of consumer legal representatives for their participation in the proceedings.
