Parents of children with cancer have organized a softball tournament at Yorba Regional Park this weekend to raise money for their support group. 
Parent-organizers Tom and Patricia McDermott and Jeff and Donna Maloney are hoping to raise about $6,000 this year for the UCI Cancer Center Parent Support Group through the tournament on Saturday and Sunday. 
The cost per co-ed team is $200 and the McDermotts and Maloneys are hoping 20 teams will play. 
For registration information, call (714) 528-3679. 
The McDermotts have a 3-year-old daughter with leukemia. The Maloneys' son, Jeff, died earlier this year from Burkitt's lymphoma.
