DY DAVIES, the USM-quoted architect, is passing its interim dividend for the
six months to the end of October after reporting an increased pre-tax loss
of Pounds 426,000, compared with Pounds 203,000.
The loss was struck after an exceptional charge of Pounds 244,000 (Pounds
44,000) to cover redundancy costs, payment of rent on unoccupied office
space and bad debts.
Mr David Davies, chairman, said: 'A number of our clients went into
receivership during the six months to the end of October.'
He added that trading remained very difficult. The only glimmer of light was
a slight increase in inquiries affecting some developments which had been
postponed.
The company has net borrowings of Pounds 2.2m compared with shareholders'
funds of Pounds 1.25m. Mr Davies said the company had not breached its loan
agreements and was working within its borrowing facilities.
Turnover during the six months fell from Pounds 5.21m to Pounds 3.54m.
Losses per share were 5.4p, compared with losses of 2.4p for the first half
of the previous financial year and losses of 5.5p for the full year.
