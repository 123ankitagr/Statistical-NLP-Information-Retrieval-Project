Triplex Lloyd, the Midlands-based engineering group, completed a management
reshuffle with the appointment, announced yesterday, of Graham Lockyer
(above) as group operations director. He put his feet under the desk on
Monday last week.
Lockyer, 47, is an experienced engineer who was managing director at Dowty
Aerospace Landing Gear. He joins the ranks of Dowty senior executives, like
Bruce Ralph, now managing director at Glynwed, who have wandered off into
Midlands manufacturing posts since the takeover by TI.
His appointment at Triplex Lloyd follows the departure last December of
Norman Price, development director but in charge of operations. Since then,
Triplex Lloyd has swept away a tier of divisional management and Lockyer
will have responsibility for all operations, reporting to John Foley, the
managing director.
