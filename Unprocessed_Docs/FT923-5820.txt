VOLVO of Sweden reported yesterday a SKr103m (Dollars 19.3m) loss after
financial items for the first half of the year, against a SKr1.16bn profit
for the same period of 1991.
Volvo said that viewed as a whole it did not anticipate any improvement in
performance in 'the immediate future'.
Volvo's sales rose by 9 per cent in the first half to SKr41.38bn from
SKr37.94bn. Its operating loss was SKr835m compared with an operating
deficit of SKr559m for the same period of last year. However, the cash flow
was positive due a reduction in working capital.
The loss came after rationalisation measures and lower product development
costs. The deficit continued in the second quarter because of weak margins
and non-recurring costs involved in taking over the British import company's
marketing operations. It said the loss was less than for the same period of
1991.
Car sales rose to SKr22.93bn for the first six months and Volvo sold 160,100
vehicles compared with 166,000 for the corresponding period last year.
The truck division made a financial loss in the first half and it suffered a
10 per cent decline in sales over the same period to SKr7.52bn.
Volvo said its cost-cutting programme was continuing and it had brought a
saving of SKr600m during the second quarter of the year.
