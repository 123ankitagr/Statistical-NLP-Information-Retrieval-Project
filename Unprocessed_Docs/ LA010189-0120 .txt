A 23-year-old yachtswoman completed a solo round trip across the Pacific Ocean on Saturday, reportedly the first woman to accomplish the feat that covered nearly 14,000 miles. 
Kyoko Imakiire, a former Kagoshima municipal office employee, was welcomed by 1,000 relatives and friends as she sailed her 4-ton yacht Kairentarachine into Kagoshima Port. 
"I wanted to be with my family on New Year's Day," Imakiire told reporters. "I was jubilant when my yacht drew close to the port." 
Imakiire covered a round-trip distance of 13,670 miles between Kagoshima and San Francisco in almost seven months. She left Kagoshima on June 11, arriving in San Francisco Aug. 20. She set out on a return cruise Oct. 20. 
Japanese news reports said Imakiire is the first woman to complete a round-trip crossing of the Pacific.
