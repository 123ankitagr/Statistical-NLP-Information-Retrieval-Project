Almost 225,000 immigrants, the highest level since 1957, swelled Canada's
total population to 27.2m last year, Robert Gibbens writes from Montreal.
Statistics Canada said the population increase was 1.5 per cent, highest in
the industrialised world. Europeans now represent only 25 per cent of total
immigrants.
