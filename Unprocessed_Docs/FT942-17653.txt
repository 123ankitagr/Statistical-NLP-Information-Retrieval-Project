North Korea yesterday rejected a relatively mild statement by the UN
Security Council urging it to accept international nuclear inspections.
Pyongyang instead insisted that the issue can only be resolved through
direct negotiations with the US, as part of an attempt to win diplomatic
recognition from Washington.
The US has refused to hold discussions with North Korea until it accepts
full inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency of its seven
declared nuclear sites.
The UN on Thursday adopted the statement. It lacks the threat of sanctions
that had been sought by the US if North Korea fails to comply.
The statement arose from a compromise to gain the support of China, which
opposes sanctions. Beijing had suggested that it would veto a tougher
resolution against North Korea.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korea foreign minister, suggested that China would
support tougher actions if North Korea does not heed the UN demand.
AP reports from Washington: The US and South Korea, after a meeting
yesterday of Mr Han and Mr William Perry, US defence secretary, deferred a
decision on resuming joint military exercises.
