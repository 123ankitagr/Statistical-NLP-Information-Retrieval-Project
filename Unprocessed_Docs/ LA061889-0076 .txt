Honor Tracy, a travel writer who wrote extensively about Spain and author of novels that satirized Irish and English society, has died at the age of 75. 
Miss Tracy, whose real name was Lilbush Wingfield, died at a nursing home in Oxford on Tuesday. The cause of death was not given. 
Born and educated in England, she traveled extensively from her base in rural Ireland and published novels and books set in the British Isles, the West Indies, Japan and Spain. 
From Ireland, she wrote a witty weekly column for the Sunday Times of London and became known for her idiosyncratic, original views. 
She published her first fiction in magazines in 1943 while working for the British Ministry of Information. 
Her hilarious essays on Irish life, "Mind You, I've Said Nothing!: Forays in the Irish Republic," were published in 1953, followed the next year by her first novel, "The Deserters," about military policewomen. 
She wrote half a dozen novels, the most successful of which was "The Straight and Narrow Path" in 1956.
