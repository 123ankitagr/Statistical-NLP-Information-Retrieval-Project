DAEWOO, the South Korean conglomerate, has been given the go-ahead to set up
joint ventures in North Korea, Reuter reports from Seoul. It is the first
time the South Korean Unification Ministry has approved a request from a
conglomerate to do so.
The ministry said: 'Daewoo has been given the approval to do joint ventures
with the north. But they have yet to receive approval on what kind of joint
ventures they will be doing with the north.'
It said Daewoo would be required to submit details of its plans and of each
proposed joint venture. 'This is just permission for the company to go ahead
with their plans for joint ventures. Daewoo would need approval again after
plans for specific kind of joint projects are submitted.'
Mr Kim Woo-choong, Daewoo chairman, discussed joint ventures in Pyongyang
during his recent visit to North Korea.
