Joe Foy, who played third base for the 1967 American League champion Boston Red Sox, died of a heart attack Thursday. He was 46 and died at his home in New York. 
Foy played for the Red Sox from 1966 through 1968, then was claimed by the Kansas City Royals in the expansion draft. He played one year for the Royals before being traded to the New York Mets. He ended his major league career in 1971 with the Washington Senators. 
Foy was known more for his defensive ability than his offensive skills. He led American League third basemen in double plays in 1966 with 28, and again in 1968 with 36.
