A man accused of killing a detective during a drug raid cannot be tried because police lied to obtain the search warrant, a judge ruled today. 
Superior Court Judge Charles M. Grabau dismissed the murder charge against Albert Lewin, 33, ending a case that has raised questions about whether police routinely lie in obtaining warrants. 
"A fair trial is not possible," the judge told a jammed courtroom. "The conduct was egregious . . . and the evidence is tainted."
