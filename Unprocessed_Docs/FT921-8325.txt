DELAY in issuing a white paper on privatising British Rail was yesterday
attributed by government officials to the complexities of the regulatory
regime.
They accept that, if the general election were held in April, privatisation
was more likely to feature in the Tory manifesto than in a white paper.
Officials were keen to play down reported differences between Mr John Major,
the prime minister, and Mr Malcolm Rifkind, transport secretary, about the
form of privatisation. They emphasised the complexity of issues such as the
fare structure in a privatised network which had still to be tackled.
Ministers were said still to be aiming for full privatisation.
Mr Major said some technical problems, including safety issues, had still to
be sorted out, and the white paper 'may or may not' be published before the
election.
The delay is the third setback for the white paper, which was promised last
summer to arrive by the end of last year.
Mr Major insisted that the Tories would still go ahead with the
privatisation of British Rail. 'That privatisation will proceed, there
should be no doubt,' he said.
