Brand manufacturers yesterday attacked a government announcement ruling out
action on supermarket 'look-alike' products in the trademarks bill, which
today starts its line-by-line Commons committee stage scrutiny.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, junior minister responsible for technology, said
yesterday the 'overwhelming majority of views' in a consultation exercise
were against using the bill to protect brand names against lookalikes.
The government said the bill, which will broaden the definition of
trademarks, would provide extra protection for brand names and should be
given a chance to work. It would consider further legislation if brand
owners could show that problems had continued.
Mr John Murphy, spokesman for the British Producers and Brand Owners Group,
whose members include Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Gillette, Mars, Nestle
and Procter & Gamble, said the government response was 'entirely
insufficient. The problem is a very serious and immediate one and strong
action is needed now'.
The British Retail Consortium and the Consumers Association welcomed the
announcement. The association said the opportunity for manufacturers to
initiate passing-off actions was a sufficient legal safeguard against unfair
competition.
