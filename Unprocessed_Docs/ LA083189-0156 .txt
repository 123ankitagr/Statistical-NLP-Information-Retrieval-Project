A convicted drug dealer told federal investigators that he used crack cocaine on repeated occasions with Washington Mayor Marion Barry last December, a television station reported. Charles Lewis, convicted in April on cocaine trafficking charges in the Virgin Islands, told federal investigators he repeatedly used drugs with Barry at Lewis' hotel room, according to Washington's WUSA-TV. Barry, who has vehemently denied ever using drugs, has twice testified before a federal grand jury investigating the matter. He has also repeatedly denied seeing any drugs or drug use in Lewis' hotel room. Barry is vacationing at an undisclosed location.
