U.S. officials put a popular entertainment and disco district in Seoul off limits to American personnel today in an attempt to stem anti-American violence and protect U.S. soldiers. 
A statement issued by the U.S. 8th Army for the 43,000 U.S. troops, thousands of civilian employees and their dependents in South Korea said the Itaewon entertainment district would be off limits indefinitely from midnight until 5 a.m., effective Friday. 
Many American families live in the area. 
It was the first time in recent years that U.S. military officials have placed an entire South Korean district off limits to American soldiers and civilians. Officials said it was being done to protect "the health and welfare" of U.S. personnel. 
"When lives are at stake, no measure is too extreme," said an unidentified official quoted in the statement. 
Itaewon is a shopping and entertainment area several city blocks long near 8th Army headquarters. Foreign tourists, shoppers and U.S. military personnel shop there by day, and at night its neon-lit bars and discos draw hundreds of young Koreans as well. 
The announcement was an apparent move to avoid clashes between South Korean civilians and American soldiers who frequent late-night bars and entertainment establishments. 
On Sunday, a crowd of Koreans chased two U.S. military policeman and threw bottles, bricks and sticks. Two vehicles, including a U.S. military patrol car, were demolished, the windows of a police station were shattered and at least half a dozen people were injured.
