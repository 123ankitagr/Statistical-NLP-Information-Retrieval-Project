A Miskito Indian who hijacked a Colombian airliner carrying more than 120 people was arrested with four accomplices Tuesday at San Jose's international airport, Costa Rican officials said. 
Demanding to be flown to Miami, the hijacker had doused one passenger with gasoline and threatened to set fire to the jet shortly after takeoff from a Colombian island, the pilot said. However, there were no serious injuries reported during the incident. 
Interior Minister Antonio Alvarez told reporters the hijacker asked to hand himself over to Costa Rican authorities after the Boeing 727 landed at San Jose's Juan Santamaria Airport. 
He identified the hijacker as Albin Anthony Siu Moses, 24, a Nicaraguan Miskito Indian who was living in Colombia. The Miskitos have been fighting a guerrilla war against Nicaragua's government. 
The motive for the hijacking was not given. 
Pilot Jaime Perez told reporters the hijacker jumped up from his seat after the plane took off from San Andres Island, bound for Medellin, Colombia, and threatened to set fire to the plane. A crew member reportedly subdued him 10 minutes before the plane landed.
