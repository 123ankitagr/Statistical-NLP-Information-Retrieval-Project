Clipper guard Gary Grant has been fined an undisclosed amount by the team and ordered to apologize to Times sportswriter Scott Howard-Cooper in the aftermath of an April 21 locker-room altercation between the two. 
Grant, after the Clippers' final game of the season, put his hand on Howard-Cooper's face and shoved him backward after accusing Howard-Cooper of not writing about an off-season charity tennis event Grant had planned. 
Howard-Cooper had written about the event, but the item was edited out of his story. 
"Elgin Baylor reached Grant by telephone Friday and informed him of the fine and directed him to phone Howard-Cooper as soon as possible and apologize," Bill Kreifeldt, Clippers' director of public relations, said.
