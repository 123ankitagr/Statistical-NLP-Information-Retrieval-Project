A man suspected of robbing an Agoura Hills savings and loan is being held without bail today after he was arrested at the end of a car and foot chase by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, authorities said. 
Roger Brady, 24, of Topanga was being held on suspicion of armed robbery at the sheriff's Malibu Station Jail, Deputy Hal Grant said. 
Brady is accused of holding up a Home Federal Savings & Loan about 2:30 p.m. Thursday in the 5800 block of Kanan Road, Grant said. The suspect pointed a gun at a teller and escaped with $2,053, he said. 
Shortly after the robbery, deputies spotted a yellow Volkswagen that matched the description of the robber's car. The car was followed on the Ventura Freeway to Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
When deputies attempted to pull the vehicle over, it sped up and was pursued. Grant said Brady drove to his home in the 20800 block of Observation Drive, then ran into a rugged, hilly area behind the house. Deputies chased him and he was arrested without incident. Grant said money and a pellet gun were found in the Volkswagen.
