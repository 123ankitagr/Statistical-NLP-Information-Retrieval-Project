Orange County eighth-graders bucked a slight statewide decline in writing scores released Wednesday by posting a six-point increase at the same time that their counterparts across California dropped a point. 
Overall, Orange County schools averaged 288 on the test, compared to a statewide average of 255. 
"Six points is really quite significant," said Tom Fong, a research analyst with the state's California Assessment Program. "Orange County did very well." 
Most districts in the county showed significant gains, with some leaping by more than 20 points on the 400-point test. Brea-Olinda Unified School District, in northern Orange County, scored the greatest improvement, increasing by 22 points to an average of 352. That score put it in the 98th percentile of districts statewide. 
At the district's only junior high school, Principal Mike Condiff credited the improvement to his staff and to a classroom configuration that gives students two consecutive periods of language arts and lumps the school's highest achieving students with others who are struggling. 
"Ever since we've gone to that system, our scores have increased dramatically," he said. "If you track kids into a remedial program, all they get is mediocre literature." 
Buena Park Elementary School District, also on the county's northern border, dropped by 26 points, the most of any county district. However, its students still posted an average score of 258, three points higher than the state average. Educators there said they were still reviewing the scores. 
Fred Lange, director of the county Education Department's effective schools unit, attributed Orange County's generally strong scores to the emphasis area schools have placed on writing in recent years. Some districts have also been especially effective at teaching students whose native language is not English, he added. 
"We're dealing with many students who come from foreign-language backgrounds, and teaching them writing is an important part of their education," Lange said. "I think you'll find that our students probably will always be a little bit above the state average." Local educators were particularly gratified by the progress made in Santa Ana, which, with 43,000 students, is Orange County's largest district and the ninth biggest in the state. More than half of the district's students have limited English skills. Still, writing scores there increased 11 points to 259, for the first time overtaking the state average. 
"Santa Ana is to be commended for the tremendous work that they are doing, especially with dealing with their large population of students who have limited English skills," Lange said. 
Santa Ana Supt. Rudy Castruita, an outspoken proponent of improved English-as-a-second language instruction, agreed that renewed emphasis on writing skills has helped boost the district's scores. 
More than 21,000 Orange County eighth-graders took the 45-minute essay test last spring, and they were among 308,000 students statewide to participate in the exam. Students were required to write an essay in one of eight categories: autobiographical incident, evaluation, problem solution, report of information, firsthand biography, story, observational writing or speculation about causes or effects. 
The essays were graded on the thinking and writing processes they displayed, as well as on basic skills such as spelling and grammar. 
Because the exam moves away from multiple-choice testing, it has won high praise from some testing experts. Cinthia Schuman, executive director of FairTest, a watchdog group campaigning for better ways of measuring student achievement, praised California's writing test as "moving in the right direction." 
Statewide, girls continued to score markedly higher on the writing test than did boys, a pattern that has shown up every year since 1987, when the test was first administered. This year, girls scored an average of 280, while boys averaged 232. 
The CAP tests, which are administered annually to almost all California students at various grade levels, are not meant as barometers of individual students' performance. Rather, they are used to evaluate schools and the effectiveness of their curricula. 
While Orange County educators said their continued success in the writing scores was evidence of the county's strong commitment to teaching those skills, Bill Honig, state superintendent of public instruction, worried that the statewide trend is not as positive. 
Honig said the one-point dip in scores might be attributable to the addition of two new writing categories in the eight-essay test but added that "it's clear we still have a long way to go in developing our students' writing abilities." 
Although some teachers and educators complain that CAP scores oversimplify a school's educational performance, Honig said Wednesday that a recent survey indicates that the CAP writing test is "successfully influencing the English curriculum in middle and junior high schools." 
More than 90% of English teachers polled said they believe that the CAP writing test "will improve or strengthen" their schools' English curricula, Honig said.

ORANGE COUNTY GRADE 8 WRITING ASSESSMENT TEST SCORES 
California Assessment Program scores for eighth grade writing were released Wednesday, and Orange County students overall raised their scores by six points. Meanwhile, students across the state dropped one point, at least in part because of changes in the test format, according to state officials. The Orange County improvement was "significant," state officials said, and local educators credited the results to area districts' emphasis on writing skills and new programs for educating students who speak English as a second language. 
To read the scores: Averages on the 400-point test are listed by county, district and individual schools. Testing experts advise against making too much of a single year's results and instead recommend that parents look at a school's progress over a period of at least two years. Scores for 1987-88 are listed in the left-hand column, while last year's are displayed in the right-hand column.
