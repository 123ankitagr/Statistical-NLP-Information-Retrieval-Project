I would like to ask the protesters against using animals for medical research two questions: 
1. Do they think it is more humane to use human beings for that purpose? 
2. How many of the protesters are vegetarians? I do not think there are many. 
Do they know that meat eaters are killing animals by the thousands every day? Therefore, such protests are not only ridiculous, but also hypocritical.
