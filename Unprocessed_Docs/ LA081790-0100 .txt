ELVIS: The 13th anniversary of the king's death yesterday did not go unrecognized: There was a flurry of calls to the Nixon Library about Elvis Presley memorabilia. . . . Among the most popular items at the Yorba Linda facility is a chrome-plated .45-caliber pistol and six silver bullets Presley gave Nixon. . . . Most inquire about buying a copy of the photograph, above, taken on Dec. 21, 1970. Alas, copies are available only from the National Archives. The picture is the most requested photograph in the archives.
