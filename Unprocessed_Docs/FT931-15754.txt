GROUPE GAN, the French-based insurance and banking company, will today
launch a new direct insurance service into the UK market.
The new company, to be called Touchline, is part of a growing push into the
so-called direct line insurance business which allows consumers to bypass
broker intermediaries by contacting the insurer directly.
The French company's move follows on the success of Bank of Scotland's
Direct Line subsidiary which pioneered telephone selling of personal
insurance in 1985.
Direct selling of personal business, such as motor and household insurance,
now accounts for around 10 per cent of the Pounds 10bn UK market.
Some 15 per cent of motor insurance alone is controlled by the direct
writers - a third of that is Direct Line - and insurance industry analysts
expect that to rise to 25 to 30 per cent of the motor insurance market by
the end of the decade.
Groupe Gan said its new subsidiary would concentrate on selling motor
insurance and in the near future would introduce household and other
personal insurance lines.
The company becomes the second major European insurer to break into the UK's
direct insurance market in the past year.
Most recently, Swiss-based Winterthur, through its UK subsidiary, Churchill,
announced its own direct insurance business.
