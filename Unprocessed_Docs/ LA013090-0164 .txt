The Berlin Film Festival, one of the most prestigious in the world, will be held next month in both halves of the city for the first time, the official ADN news agency said today. 
For the past 40 years the festival has been staged in West Berlin. The news agency said theaters on both sides of the crumbling Berlin Wall will be used for competition and exhibition showings during February's 12-day festival. Since the wall was breached in November, cultural links between East and West Berlin have strengthened rapidly.
