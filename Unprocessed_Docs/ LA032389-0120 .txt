Paul von Welanetz, who with his wife, Diana, wrote six cookbooks and hosted a cooking show on cable television for three years (1982-85) died Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center. 
He was 61 and had been battling cancer. 
Since 1962 he and his wife had been writing, teaching and answering questions about culinary matters. 
In 1985, the same year their "The New Way Gourmet" show on Lifetime Cable Network went off the air, the Von Welanetzes founded a self-realization group called "Inside Edge." The nonpolitical, nonsectarian group now numbers about 500 members who meet weekly at various restaurants throughout the Southland. 
Besides his wife, Von Welanetz is survived by two daughters and two grandchildren. A memorial service will be held Friday at noon at Church of the Recessional, Forest Lawn Glendale.
