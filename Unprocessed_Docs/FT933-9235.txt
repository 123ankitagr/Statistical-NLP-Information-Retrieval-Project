Kurdish rebels have released a Briton and an Australian kidnapped in the
mountains of south-east Turkey five weeks ago, Reuter reports from Ankara.
Mr David Rowbottom, a British oil engineer, and Ms Tania Miller, a nurse,
walked into a police station late yesterday, a British diplomat said. They
were apparently unharmed.
Earlier, guerrillas of the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK) also released four
Frenchmen after holding them hostage in the same region for more than two
weeks.
Meanwhile, the PKK killed eight people in an attack on a minibus in eastern
Turkey, the semi-official Anatolian news agency reported. Guerrillas raked
the passenger minibus near Genc in Bingol province. Ten passengers were
wounded.
