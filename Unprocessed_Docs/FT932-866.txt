President Bill Clinton yesterday named Miss Christine Gabbie as the
co-ordinator of US policy on Aids, and promised that health care reforms now
being developed would ensure that Aids patients were 'not victimised by
unfair insurance policies', Lisa Bransten writes from Washington. Miss
Gabbie, a nurse who was director of Washington state's health department and
served on the presidential commission on Aids under Ronald Reagan, will
oversee the Dollars 2.7bn Aids budget.
