CBS, the loss-making US television network, is believed to be offering deep
discounts to US advertisers in an effort to fill advertising slots for the
winter Olympic games, which begin next weekend in Albertville, France,
writes Alan Friedman.
Mr George Schweitzer, senior vice-president of marketing, said he would not
comment on pricing policies, nor on a report in Advertising Age, the US
trade publication, that yesterday quoted buyers who estimated that CBS was
offering prime time advertising slots for as much as 40 per cent below
normal Olympic rates.
