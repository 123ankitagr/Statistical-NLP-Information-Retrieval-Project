THREE Canadian MPs were yesterday expelled from China after meeting
relatives of jailed Chinese dissidents and threatening to lay a wreath in
Tiananmen Square, symbol of the 1989 massacre.
The three MPs claimed they were 'manhandled' then 'thrown' into a bus to
Beijing airport. A Canadian diplomat accompanying the delegation was also
denied diplomatic privileges, the MPs say. China claimed the three indulged
in 'activities incompatible with their status in China'.
Mr Svend Robinson, the New Democratic Party's spokesman on human rights,
said China knew in advance the focus of the delegation's visit was human
rights. 'We feel a profound sense of sadness and tragedy that we leave
behind in China thousands who are victims of human rights infringements,' he
said.
The incident was similar to a September visit to Beijing by US congressmen,
led by Representative Nancy Pelosi. The congressmen also focused on
Tiananmen Square, but were frustrated by Chinese police.
China insists it will not tolerate interference in what it regards as
internal affairs. Yesterday's events are embarrassing for the Chinese, none
the less, because they come shortly before several human rights and trade
issues come up for discussion before the US Congress.
The MPs, speaking upon their arrival in Hong Kong, said they had finished a
meeting with Rong Yiren, head of China International Trust and Investment
Corporation, when they were taken to a police station where about 100 army
and police were present. They were then taken in a convoy of 14 cars to the
airport and were not allowed to return to their hotel.
