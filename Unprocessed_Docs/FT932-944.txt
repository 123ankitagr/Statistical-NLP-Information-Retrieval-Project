ANZ, the Australian banking group, has won formal approval from the Peoples'
Bank of China and local government authorities to open a branch banking
office in Shanghai and a representative office in Guangzhou, writes Bruce
Jacques from Sydney.
ANZ's chief executive officer, Mr Don Mercer, said yesterday the Shanghai
branch was due to open later this year and would make the ANZ the first
Australian group with a branch banking operation in mainland China.
ANZ already has a representative office in Beijing and branch offices in
Hong Kong and Taipei.
