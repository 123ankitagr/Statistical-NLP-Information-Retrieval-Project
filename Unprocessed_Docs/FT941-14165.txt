One award not mooted at yesterday's annual awards ceremony of The Oldie
magazine was one for would-be author of the 'oldest proposed book yet to
appear in print'. One candidate - alongside Sir Edward Heath, whose memoirs
are in danger of being scooped by the public record office publishing under
the 30-year rule - would be Oldie founding editor Richard Ingrams himself.
He has just handed over the editorship to ex-Observer editor Donald Trelford
so that he can try yet again to complete his long-awaited biography of
one-time Punch editor Malcolm Muggeridge. Don't hold your breath.
