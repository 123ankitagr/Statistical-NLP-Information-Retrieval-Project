Alejandro Krell of UCLA and Mathew Anderson and Michael Smith-Heimer of UC Berkeley were among the 1989 winners of the Henry S. Miller Sr. and Jr. Fellowships awarded to California university graduate students. 
The awards are given by the Urban Land Institute to students following an interdisciplinary curriculum in real estate development.
