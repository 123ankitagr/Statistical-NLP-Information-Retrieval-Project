Amy Jalewalia scored only eight points as the La Quinta High School girls' basketball team lost to top-seeded Point Loma, 39-36, Thursday in a Southern California Division II Regional semifinal at Point Loma. 
Jalewalia, the second-leading girls' scorer in the state with a 34-point average, fouled out on a charging call with 3 minutes 36 seconds remaining. 
"She hasn't scored that low since her freshman year," La Quinta Coach Kevin Kiernan said. 
Said Jalewalia: "I was off. I tried to do too much. I was getting the shots, I just got flustered, I guess." 
Robin Rabello, a 6-foot senior center, scored a season-high 12 points, pulled down 13 rebounds -- seven in the first quarter -- and had three steals for Point Loma (29-3). 
Point Loma trailed, 36-35, when Tyeast Brown scored off her own rebound and gave the Pointers a 37-36 lead with a minute remaining. 
Point Loma called a timeout, and after missed shots by both teams, Point Loma's Stacy Wainwright was fouled with 13 seconds left, but she missed the front end of the one-and-one. Rabello was in perfect position, grabbed the rebound and scored to give Point Loma a 39-36 lead. La Quinta shot from three-point range, but was way off target. 
Point Loma meets Muir, a 58-44 winner over Ventura, Saturday in the Division II final at the Los Angeles Sports Arena. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE
