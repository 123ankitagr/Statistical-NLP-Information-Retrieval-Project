Turkey's rating outlook may be stabilising following several credit rating
downgrades earlier this year.
Standard & Poor's, the US rating agency, yesterday affirmed its B+ rating
for Turkey's long-term foreign currency debt. S&P also said it was removing
Turkey from CreditWatch, and that its rating outlook is now stable.
Turkey's ratings came under heavy pressure from the severe deterioration in
the country's public finances and the sharp fall in its foreign currency
reserves early in the year. In January, S&P downgraded Turkey's foreign debt
rating to BBB - from BBB; in March it was lowered again, to BB, and the
country was placed on CreditWatch with negative implications; in April it
was again lowered, to B+.
But according to S&P, its latest rating action 'reflects Turkey's improved
fiscal performance in the second quarter of 1994, which, in turn, has helped
stabilise the Turkish lira, partially restore the government's foreign
exchange reserves and greatly reduce inflation.'
