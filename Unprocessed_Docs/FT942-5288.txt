South Korea wants the United Nations to give North Korea a deadline by which
it must open its nuclear sites to international inspection or be slapped
with economic sanctions, Seoul officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Seoul.
'What the international community wants is North Korean nuclear transparency
and not punishment for the sake of punishment,' a government official said.
Yoo Chong-ha, South Korea's UN ambassador, said: 'It is the South Korean
government's clear position that there's no other option but to seek
sanctions against North Korea through the United Nations.'
He told the Seoul daily Dong-A Ilbo that the five permanent members of the
UN Security Council would soon begin intensive consultations on a US-drafted
resolution on sanctions.
