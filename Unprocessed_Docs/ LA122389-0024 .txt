Who can explain it? Each year the wonderful miracle of Christmas is repeated. It's as if our good God, during this period of time leading up to the birthday of his son, deluges the earth with his very own spirit of "giving," causing our selfish human natures to make a 180-degree turn and ask not what I can get but rather what I can "give" to others.
