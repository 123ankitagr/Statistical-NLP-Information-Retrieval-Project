THE COMMONS committee on Scotland is to inquire into the workings of
Scottish Enterprise, the network of enterprise agencies in Scotland set up
in 1991.
The inquiry, to include Highlands and Islands Enterprise, will look into
recent claims by the Scottish media and opposition politicians that the
network is ineffective.
Scottish Enterprise has also attracted criticism over potential conflicts of
interest involving board members of the local enterprise companies.
Scottish Enterprise sees the select committee inquiry, which will take place
in the new year, as a chance to rebut criticism and to present its record to
detailed scrutiny.
