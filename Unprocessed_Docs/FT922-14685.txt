NORTHUMBRIA Ambulance Service, one of the first ambulance services to have
become a self-governing trust, has awarded employees a 5 per cent pay award
from April 1.
The award, the first local deal in the ambulance service, is higher than the
settlement offered to ambulance workers who are either not employed by
trusts or who have not accepted trust terms and conditions.
They have national negotiating machinery and this week they were made a
final offer of 4.75 per cent or Pounds 400, whichever was the greater.
