Romania showed off its military hardware yesterday, firing shells and
rockets into the Black Sea against an imaginary enemy in an exercise for its
old foes, Reuter reports from Cap Midia, Romania. Military observers from 11
western and Balkan countries, plus Nato, watched Romanian troops repel an
amphibious attack. Romania was the first former Warsaw pact member to sign
up for Nato's Partnership for Peace programme.
