Morality over money! How refreshing to read (Part A, March 28) that two chemical firms, Occidental and Mobay, have refused to sell the ingredients of nerve gas to the mighty Pentagon itself! I hope some edict doesn't force them to "say uncle." They are saving us from the universal opprobrium we would merit if we resumed manufacture of chemical weapons while purportedly negotiating a worldwide ban.
