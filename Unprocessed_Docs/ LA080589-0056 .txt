Three people who chained themselves to a cage at Marion County's Humane Society for 3 1/2 hours to protest an order to kill their dog for biting a pedestrian won at least a temporary reprieve. 
The dog, a small black dachshund-terrier mix named Blue Two, will not be put to death before Monday, the Humane Society said Thursday. That would give the protesters time to appeal in Marion County Circuit Court. 
State law requires that a dog be put to death if it is found to have bitten and injured or killed a person without provocation.
