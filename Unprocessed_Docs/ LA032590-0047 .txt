Re "Lean Times for Foreign-Language Films," Feb. 25: 
There will be fat times from April 20 to May 3 when the American Film Institute Los Angeles Film Festival will present over 100 foreign-language films from more than 40 countries in five cinemas. 
All of the films mentioned in Sheila Benson's article as important will be presented in the AFI L.A. FilmFest. Many of film makers will be here as well. 
AFI Los Angeles Film Festival was organized four years ago in cooperation with the Filmex Board to replace Filmex as the Los Angeles International Film Festival after that fine festival had financial problems.
