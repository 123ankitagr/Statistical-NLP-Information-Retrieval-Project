An initiative aimed at limiting the terms of state elected officials, sponsored by Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, has qualified for the November ballot, the secretary of state's office announced. It would limit all elected state officials to two four-year terms except members of the Assembly, who would be limited to three two-year terms. 
Another initiative on the same subject, proposed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp, also qualified. This one would limit state legislators and members of the State Board of Equalization to 12 years in office, would prevent future governors and other statewide elected officials from serving more than eight years and would sharply reduce the amount of money candidates could spend on elections. Among 11 other initiatives that also qualified by the deadline are proposals to protect timberlands, raise alcohol taxes, outlaw fishing with gill nets and allow state prisoners to work for private businesses.
