The list below illustrates the complex web of direct and circumstantial evidence against Richard Ramirez, including incriminating statements he made after his arrest.  The 43 felony charges involved 13 murders. Prosecutors said most of the crimes contained various Ramirez "signatures," such as "distinctive" and "gaping" stab and slash wounds to the throat or body; the language he used that was recounted by survivors; the use of ligatures and restraints, including handcuffs and thumbcuffs, and unusual Avia shoe prints at some of the crime scenes.  Another alleged Ramirez trademark was the pentagram, which first appeared at the scene of a murder in Monrovia, drawn on a bedroom wall and on a victim's thigh. Such pentagrams also were found on the dashboard of Ramirez's car and on his arm.  Four handguns were used, but only one was recovered. However, firearms tests showed that unused bullets in a Ramirez bag had been loaded into the gun that was used in two of the incidents. Finally, about 375 pieces of jewelry and other personal property taken from six of the murder sites were recovered and linked to Ramirez.
