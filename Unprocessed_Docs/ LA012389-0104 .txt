El Modena High School theater arts students are planning a fund-raising musical-variety show Saturday for a 1982 alumna who is burdened with "enormous hospital bills" because of the premature birth of her baby. 
"Ever since the premature birth of her baby, Brandon, Chariya (McGee), an alumna of El Modena, and her husband, Steve McGee, have been plagued with medical bills," said Andrea Menke, spokeswoman for the fund-raiser. 
Menke said Chariya McGee has helped with many theatrical and musical productions in Orange since graduating from El Modena High in 1982. 
In addition to the musical variety show, the fund-raiser will also feature an all-you-can-eat dessert bar available at intermission. The $15-per-person ticket includes the show and dessert bar, Menke said. 
The event will start at 7:30 p.m. and be at El Modena High, 3920 Spring St. 
Tickets can be bought in advance through the El Modena High theater arts department or at the door. Information is available at (714) 998-4949.
