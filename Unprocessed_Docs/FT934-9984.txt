Possibly not the best time to be associated with the blood giving business,
but Hartlepool brewer Camerons had the best of intentions when it launched
its latest marketing ploy, a pint of ruby red Strongarm Bitter for every new
blood donor on Teesside.
Managing director Derek Andrew's idea was warmly welcomed by the Blood
Transfusion Service, whose only condition was that the beer be drunk off the
premises. Sadly Andrew's invitation to tea and biscuit manufacturers' to
demonstrate similar spunk leaves a nasty taste in the mouth just at the
moment.
