THE United Nations Security Council yesterday demanded that Iraq immediately
let UN inspectors search Baghdad's Agriculture Ministry for weapons
information.
It said Baghdad's attitude was a 'material and unacceptable breach by Iraq'
of a Gulf war ceasefire resolution but did not say what it would do if Iraq
did not comply.
The confrontation began on Sunday when a weapons inspection team was unable
to enter the ministry. Iraqi authorities said information kept there was
beyond the scope of UN weapons inspections and not covered in Security
Council resolutions.
