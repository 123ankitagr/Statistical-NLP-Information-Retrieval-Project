George Allen is teaching something that the Los Angeles Times will never understand. America loves a winner and will not tolerate a loser. George Allen teaches the most valuable lesson a person will ever learn: In every "skid row bum," in every "loser" beats the heart of a winner. 
With George Allen, even if you lose, you win. You win character and courage to go on and prepare to win the next battle.
