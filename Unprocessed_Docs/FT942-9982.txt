Commodity traders and agribusinesses in Europe are the target customers of a
new company called CropSense, which plans to market crop forecasts using
satellite imagery and economic models.
The company is a joint venture between the National Remote Sensing Centre of
the UK, a leading supplier of agricultural information from satellites, and
Cropcast of Maryland, which provides commodity forecasts to over 100,000
customers worldwide.
'The new company will provide a similar service to Cropcast but targeted on
Europe,' said Mr Neil Pattie, marketing communications manager of NRSC,
which is 56 per cent-owned by British Aerospace.
'Reforms to the common agricultural policy limiting planted acreage, the
prospect of increased production from some east European countries, and now
the passage of Gatt reforms will expose Europe to world market pricing. This
is likely to result in more volatile commodity prices, so accurate and
timely forecast information will be of particular value.'
The company, located at Farnborough, southern England, is 51 per cent owned
by NRSC and 49 per cent by Cropcast. NRSC, whose turnover last year was
Pounds 5.8m, has just been awarded a contract by the UK agriculture ministry
for satellite imagery to check farmers' claims for support payments for
their arable crops and set-aside land.
