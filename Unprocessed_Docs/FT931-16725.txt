Storehouse, the retail group which includes BhS and Mothercare, added to
recent optimism in the stores sector yesterday when it announced its
Christmas trading had been encouraging.
The group said Christmas sales were in line with expectations, and
consistent with the trend of year-on-year sales increases, averaging about 8
per cent, which Storehouse has shown in the last 15 months. Margins, which
improved by between 1 and 2 percentage points in the first half of the year,
improved at a similar rate in the second half.
'The important thing is we had a pretty good Christmas the previous year, so
to continue to make progress was very pleasing,' the company said. It added
that Christmas offers at BhS on many items including special gifts, food and
lingerie had sold particularly well.
Trading last week, when many stores saw record numbers on the first days of
their January sales, was described as very good, well up on the same week
last year.
