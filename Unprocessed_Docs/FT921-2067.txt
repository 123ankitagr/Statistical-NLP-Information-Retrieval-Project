MR Paddy Ashdown, leader of the Liberal Democrats, admitted last night that
he could face difficulties in persuading his party to back a minority
Conservative government to keep Labour out of office.
Interviewed by Sir Robin Day on Thames Television's This Week, he said: 'It
may require a very considerable degree of leadership. What will matter to me
is what is right for the country and not what is right for the party.'
