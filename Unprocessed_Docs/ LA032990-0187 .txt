The Orange Coast College speech and debate team won its fourth state title in five years this week, defeating Santa Rosa Junior College, which was host for the three-day tournament. 
The team will compete for its second consecutive national title next month during the National Community College Speech Tournament in Kansas City. 
Orange Coast College has won the national championship five times in last the 12 years. 
"But before we start thinking too much about Kansas City," coach Peg Taylor said, "I think we'll take a moment or two to savor the state championship." 
Chris DeSurra of Costa Mesa was the top winner, with three gold medals and a bronze. Tiffany Stewart of Costa Mesa and Ronnie Rubens of Corona each took home two gold medals and a silver. Stewart and Rubens are also members of a reader's theater group called "Desperate Remedies," which won a bronze.
