Forward Wayman Tisdale of the Sacramento Kings bought part of the Oklahoma City Cavalry, a Continental Basketball Assn. expansion team. Tisdale, who played at Oklahoma, was one of about 30 investors in the team, which will begin play in the 1990-91 season. 
"The main reason for getting involved is that once my career is over as a player, I would like to become an owner," Tisdale said.
