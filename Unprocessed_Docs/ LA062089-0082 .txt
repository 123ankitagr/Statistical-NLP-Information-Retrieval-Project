A major river swollen by heavy rains spilled over its embankment, washing away thousands of huts and leaving 50,000 people homeless, officials said Monday. The Gumti River has breached the mud embankment in four places since Sunday in Comilla, inundating several thousand acres of crops, said Alim Hussain, a Comilla district official.
