Vietnamese community leaders have been invited by Pacific Bell to help celebrate on Wednesday the opening of the telephone company's Vietnamese Service Center in Tustin. 
The new center, which is part of the telephone company's Asian marketing plan, will have eight Vietnamese-speaking employees taking orders for residential telephone service and answering billing inquires in Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, company spokeswoman Linda Bonniksen said. 
Pacific Bell will hold an open house at the center, which is in the Pacific Bell office complex in Tustin at 1472 Edinger Ave., in Room 2150 of Building 2. 
The Vietnamese Service Center is expected to expand its services to include San Diego County in February and Los Angeles County in June. By 1990, the center expects to serve the estimated 278,000 Vietnamese living in California, said Reed L. Royalty, Pacific Bell area vice president.
