As UK dairies seek to improve efficiency and profitability in the run-up to
the European Community's single market reforms, Unigate has become the first
to adopt new European developments in plastic bottling technology.
MDR Interfaces of East Sussex and Dutch-based Nepas have combined forces to
produce for Unigate a high-speed container loader for imperial and metric
sizes of plastic bottles.
The computer control built into the line allows individual orders to be
loaded automatically for direct delivery to supermarkets.
Increased automation is reducing errors, and orders are being dealt with
quicker. Plastic bottles account for more than 50 per cent of all UK
supermarket milk sales, but MDR and Nepas see potential in any industry
using plastic bottles in bulk. MDR Interfaces: UK, 0825 790294.
