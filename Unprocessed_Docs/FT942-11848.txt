A fax bureau says that Mercury, the UK's second-largest telecommunications
carrier, overcharged it by up to Pounds 100,000 in 12 months by transmitting
its faxes too slowly. The bureau is preparing a formal complaint to Oftel,
the industry watchdog.
Comwave, the UK subsidiary of Swiss-based company Comwave Communications,
said network providers do not have to comply with regulatory standards while
manufacturers' equipment must pass stringent standards before it can be
connected to the network.
Oftel agreed this week that public telecommunications operators were not
obliged to guarantee that fax calls would be successful or completed at any
particular speed.
Comwave said that faxes sent on Mercury lines took an average of 18 per cent
more time than faxes on British Telecommunications lines. It warned that
other companies using Mercury could unwittingly be paying too much for fax
transmission. Comwave has switched to another network operator for its fax
business.
It claims to be the first company in the UK to have established a global fax
broadcast service. The service is used by customers such as McGraw Hill, the
US publisher, Swiss Bank and British Alcan to distribute time-critical
information.
Last year Comwave noticed that faxes sent on some of its 50 Mercury lines
were taking longer than they should.
The cause of the problem, which Mercury does not deny, was a mismatch
between Comwave's fax machines and a piece of Mercury equipment which
essentially persuaded the machine that it was transmitting over a
poor-quality line and dropped the transmission speed accordingly.
Mercury, while not admitting liability, has agreed to credit Comwave with
Pounds 20,000.
