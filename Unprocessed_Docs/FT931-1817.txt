The debate on large awards of punitive damages in the US, fuelled by the
recent award of Dollars 101m against General Motors, has prompted three more
states - Texas, Indiana and New Jersey - to introduce legislation making a
percentage of any punitive award payable to state funds.
The Texas bill calls for 50 per cent of punitive awards to be paid to the
state. Indiana proposes that 75 per cent of any punitive award should go to
its Victim and Witness Assistance Program, and New Jersey wants 75 per cent
of any punitive award paid to the state's Uncompensated Care Trust Fund,
which reimburses hospitals for those patients who cannot afford to pay.
Meanwhile, a plaintiff in Florida who lost 60 per cent of his Dollars
512,600 award under similar legislation has appealed to the US Supreme
Court, alleging that such legislation is unconstitutional. The court has
already ruled against similar laws in Colorado and Georgia.
