The City Council has decided to add stop signs at two more residential intersections to discourage commuters from using the neighborhood as a shortcut. 
Last month, the council approved 23 stop signs in another neighborhood plagued with commuter traffic. 
The stop signs are meant to make the residential streets less attractive to motorists trying to find the fastest way to work and home. 
The stop signs will go up in about two weeks at the intersections of Las Palmas Drive at Coronado Drive and on Hermosa Drive at Santa Maria Avenue, city traffic engineer Paul Smith said. 
Although an independent traffic engineer had recommended further measures, such as making Lakeview Drive a one-way street, the council rejected that idea. Most residents were opposed to the change. 
The council decided, however, to have the city Transportation and Circulation Commission study blocking off Lakeview at the city's border with La Habra to discourage Imperial Highway traffic from using Lakeview as a shortcut. 
Jerry Younker, who lives south of Lakeview on Terraza Place, submitted a petition signed by 140 area residents asking for the closure. TOM McQUEENEY
