Sir, Your correspondent, Lucy Kellaway, will be disappointed if I do not
write to complain about her very fulsome article, 'Prime of life at Premier
Oil' (People, August 8). Frankly, I was less than pleased by her quotation
from a discharged employee. But, all in all, it was one of her better
columns. However, what really was libellous was the caricature which bore no
resemblance whatsoever to . . .
yours faithfully,
