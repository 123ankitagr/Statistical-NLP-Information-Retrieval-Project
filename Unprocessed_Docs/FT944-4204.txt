Using a computer to handle voice and fax messages often means leaving it
switched on even when the user is out.
Martignoni Electronics, a Swiss communication company, has launched a
personal message centre, which stores fax and telephone messages, regardless
of whether the PC is switched on. The Spiderman, which stores 20 pages of
fax or 60 minutes of voice messages, costs Pounds 349.
