The FBI has opened an investigation into a vandalism attack that left the home of a black Simi Valley family in shambles and defaced by racial epithets, Gary Auer, supervisor of the agency's Ventura County office, said Tuesday. 
Auer said the FBI is required to investigate racially motivated crimes under the 1968 Civil Rights Act. He declined to discuss details of the case, but said his office would be working with the Simi Valley Police Department in its investigation. 
Simi Valley Police Detective Anthony Anzilotti said the federal agency's involvement "could be beneficial." No arrests have been made. 
The word skinheads was among the graffiti spray-painted inside the house. 
The damage was discovered Aug. 14 when Louis Boss, his wife and four children returned to their home on Niles Street from an out-of-town trip. Boss, 36, is an English and reading teacher at Northridge Junior High School.
