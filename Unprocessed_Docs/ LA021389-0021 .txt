Jesse White, best known as the desperately lonely Maytag repairman in television commercials, has had enough solitude. "There's only so much loneliness a guy can take," White said in announcing his retirement as the appliance company's spokesman. Gordon Jump, best known as Mr. Carlson from his days on "WKRP in Cincinnati," will replace White as Maytag's new lonely guy. ALEENE MacMINN and STEVE WEINSTEIN
