Former House Speaker Jim Wright left Capitol Hill for the last time as a congressman today, his 34-year career brought to an end by charges that he violated House ethics rules. 
Wright (D-Tex.) stepped down as Speaker June 6 and resigned from the House effective at the end of Friday, but he left the Capitol this noon while the House was debating a foreign aid bill. He and his wife, Betty, flew by private jet to Ft. Worth, where his supporters prepared a welcome home party and parade. 
Smiling and relaxed, Wright, 66, waved to the tourists and congressional staffers who happened to be in the area when he stepped out of the Capitol and walked to his chauffeured car. 
He joked with waiting reporters and photographers, "You ought to treat guys this well when they come to Washington. . . . They might want to stay."
