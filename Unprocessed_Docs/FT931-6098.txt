REDUNDANCY is a time for feeling sorry for yourself. Perhaps this state of
mind helps explain why many redundant managers finish up feeling sorry for
others as well, decide they want to 'do something useful' with their lives
and consider working for a charity.
There are other motivating factors. A redundancy payment might make it
possible for a manager to take a lower-paid post. Although many big
charities pay better than they once did, the voluntary sector does not
generate lavish incomes.
Neither is it a soft option. Many charities are facing the same recessionary
pressures as the private sector. Some are having to make staff redundant and
those that are recruiting demand commitment and hard work. However,
opportunities do exist. Around one-third of voluntary-sector managers are
drawn from commercial organisations, so the right type of person will not
find a culture of resistance to outside recruitment.
Who is the right type of person? The voluntary sector is not a quiet
backwater - it turns over around 4 per cent of GDP. Big charities need much
the same range of finance, marketing, personnel and other specialist skills
as private companies.
But many have day-to-day contact with voluntary workers and are run in a
more open, committee-structured way than commercial organisations. Managers
who incline to a participative, decision-making style are more likely to
settle into this atmosphere than those who draw comfort from giving and
receiving orders.
Expertise in a charity's area of activities or previous involvement with the
voluntary sector can help. For anyone contemplating an eventual
career-switch to a charity, this can be gained from voluntary work. The
Volunteer Centre UK* is a national charity that exists to promote
volunteering.
