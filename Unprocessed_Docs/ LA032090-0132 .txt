The City Council will hold a public hearing at 7:30 p.m. tonight to consider allowing a larger medical office building next to St. Jude Hospital and Rehabilitation Center. 
The proposed building at the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia Mesa Drive has been rejected twice in the last seven months as being too large. 
Original plans called for a 109,000-square-foot office building to replace the 31,500-square-foot building there now. 
Neighbors have complained that a larger office would increase traffic. 
The developer, McBride Development Co. of Brea, reduced the size of the proposed building to 72,000 square feet and resubmitted the drawings to the Planning Commission in February. The commission denied those plans, 4 to 1. 
Plans for the three-story medical building include a four-level parking garage with 355 spaces. 
If the council approves the expanded building, it is expected to adopt a recommendation by city planners to require off-site parking during construction because of the lost parking spaces. Planners also have asked the council to require a shuttle bus to operate between the building and parking lots at the hospital and a nearby closed restaurant.
