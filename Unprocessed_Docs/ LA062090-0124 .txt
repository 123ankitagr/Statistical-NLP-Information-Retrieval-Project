Kansas City Paper Folds: The Kansas City Evening News will cease publication after today's edition, just five weeks after it was launched by a suburban publishing company, Publisher Steve Rose said. The newspaper, owned by Sun Publications Inc., was introduced May 14 to fill a gap created when the Kansas City Star Co. combined its afternoon and morning newspapers into a single morning newspaper, the Kansas City Star, on March 1.
