City Clerk/Treasurer Jenny Young-Felty has resigned. 
Young-Felty, 47, last week sent a brief letter of resignation to city officials, and removed her belongings from City Hall Wednesday afternoon. She did not give a reason for the resignation, Acting City Manager Lee Powell said. 
Young-Felty, who had held the position since February, 1987, declined to comment. 
Downey Mayor Randall R. Barb also declined to comment other than to say: "We have a resignation from Jenny. That's really the whole story." 
Young-Felty, a former Whittier city clerk, was appointed to the Downey position by the City Council after the retirement of City Clerk/Treasurer Robert L. Shand. The position paid $4,129 a month, a city spokeswoman said. 
Barb said the City Council is scheduled to appoint Shand as interim city clerk/treasurer at its meeting Tuesday night.
