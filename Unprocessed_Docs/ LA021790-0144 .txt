Taping has started for the first segment of a new monthly television show designed to inform residents of city services and events in Anaheim. 
Hosted by the city's public information department, the first "Anaheim Accents" program will include interviews of city officials involved with community redevelopment, alley revitalization and earthquake preparedness projects. 
A calendar of city events also will be a regular feature of the show. 
The new show is part of the city's contract with Multi Vision Cable Co., which regularly tapes City Council meetings. The show will debut in early March on government access Channel 30.
