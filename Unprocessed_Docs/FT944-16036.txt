British Airways yesterday said it was suspending its loss-making Concorde
scheduled service between London and Washington DC after 18 years.
BA, which will continue to operate its profitable twice-daily London-New
York Concorde services, plans to develop supersonic charter flights for the
US market.
After the end of its thrice-weekly scheduled Concorde Washington service
from November 8 BA will permanently base one of its seven Concordes at New
York's JFK airport.
The airline yesterday said there was increasing US demand for Concorde
charter flights.
BA has already won business to operate a weekly Concorde charter flight
between New York and Barbados for three months starting in December. The
flight takes two hours and 20 minutes - half the subsonic journey time.
BA said: 'We see possibilities for expanding charter services from New York
to South America, Bermuda and Mexico.'
The scheduled Washington service, which was Concorde's first transatlantic
route, has averaged passenger loads of only 30 per cent compared with an
average of about 70 per cent for the New York service, which has round-trip
ticket prices of more than Pounds 5,000.
The suspension of BA's service to Washington's Dulles airport means that New
York is the only US destination served by regular supersonic scheduled
services from London Heathrow - operated by BA - and Paris Charles de
Gaulle, operated by Air France.
Air France has already stopped scheduled Concorde flights between Paris and
Washington.
