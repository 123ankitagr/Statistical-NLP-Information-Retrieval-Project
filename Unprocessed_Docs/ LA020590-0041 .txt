A South Korean student who made a publicized but illegal trip to North Korea last year was sentenced to 10 years in prison by a Seoul court. Im Su Kyong, 21, and her co-defendent, Father Moon Kyu Hyun, who was given an eight-year term, were sentenced under South Korea's stringent national security laws for their trip last July to a youth festival.
