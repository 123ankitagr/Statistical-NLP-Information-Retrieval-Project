Evgeny Sadovyi of the Unified Team shattered the world record in the men's
400 metres freestyle when he won his third Olympic swimming gold medal. The
shaven-headed Russian edged out Kieren Perkins in a dramatic last-length
battle as both dipped below the Australian's world mark.
Sweden's Anders Holmertz led from the start until the final length but had
to settle for bronze.
Meanwhile Nick Gillingham won Britain's first Olympic swimming medal when
taking the men's 200m breaststroke bronze with a new Commonwealth record of
2 min 11.29 sec. Mike Barrowman of the US took gold with a world record of
2:10.16. Norbert Rozsa of Hungary was second.
