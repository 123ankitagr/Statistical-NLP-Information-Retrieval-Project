It seems inconceivable to me that three former presidents and other dignitaries will gather next month to pay homage to Richard Nixon, the most disgraced president since Ulysses S. Grant and who came within a hair of being impeached. 
I hope his library will contain not only the record of his Administration but the complete story of Watergate and the stories of his vilified campaigns against Reps. Jerry Voorhees and Helen Gahagan Douglas. The missing 18-minute White House tape might also provide a useful insight. 
Let's hope the library will tell the complete story about this man!
