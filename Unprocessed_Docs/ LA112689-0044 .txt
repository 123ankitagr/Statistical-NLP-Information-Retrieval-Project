I believe your reporter, the market analysts and the auto industry are all missing the real reason behind falling sales of American cars ("Rebates, Production Cuts Blamed for 27.5% Drop in Auto Profits," Oct. 27). 
The real reason for U.S. auto makers' problems is that they are simply losing the competition with foreign car makers. 
One auto industry expert, Brock Yates, blames management as well as labor in his book, "The Decline and Fall of the American Automobile Industry." 
American buyers are not as naive as American car makers may think. Getting rebates or long warranty periods are meaningless if you have a car that keeps needing repair or just doesn't work right. 
It would be truly refreshing if American cars actually performed as well as the sexy advertisements. 
Unless American car makers start making better cars and stop trying to fool American car buyers, I think I, for one, will continue to buy foreign cars.
