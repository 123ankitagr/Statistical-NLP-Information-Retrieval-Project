Coles Myer, one of Australia's largest retailers, and Rank Commercial, the
New Zealand-based company owned by Mr Graeme Hart, yesterday withdrew from
their ADollars 501m (USDollars 372m) takeover assault on Foodland
Associated, the Western Australian grocery business.
Had the offer, to be made by a subsidiary of Rank and funded by borrowed
money, gone ahead, Rank planned to sell on Foodland's Australian assets to
Coles for around ADollars 250m. Foodland's New Zealand interests would have
been sold on to Whitcoulls, a stationery and book retailer.
The decision to ditch the bid came after the Australian Federal Court
yesterday dismissed the two companies' appeal against a temporary injunction
which prevented Coles/Rank from pursuing the offer until at least
mid-September.
This had been successfully obtained by the Trade Practices Commission,
Australia's competition watchdog.
