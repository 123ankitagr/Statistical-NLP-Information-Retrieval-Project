The unrestricted fare between the San Francisco Bay area and Los Angeles has been raised by 15%, making it the most expensive shuttle in the country. 
Beginning on Thursday, American, United and USAir raised the fare on the 315-mile trip to $148 from $129 each way. 
The fare hike applies to flights from San Francisco, Oakland and San Jose in the Bay Area and to airports in Los Angeles, Burbank, Long Beach, Ontario and Orange County. 
United said the fare hike was necessary to keep pace with fare increases elsewhere, and the airline called the increase "modest." 
The fare hike means the per-mile cost to fly between the Bay Area and Los Angeles is 47 cents. In contrast, the unrestricted fare between Washington, D.C., and New York is $99 each way, or 46 cents per mile. The Dallas to Houston shuttle is $59 one way, or 25 cents per mile. 
American, United and USAir control more than 90% of the business on flights between the Bay Area and the Los Angeles Basin, according to the U.S. Department of Transportation.
