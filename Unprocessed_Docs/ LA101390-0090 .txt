A wildlife research plane has disappeared over the Arctic Ocean and a search was started Friday over the forbidding polar ice north of Alaska, federal officials reported. 
The chartered U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service airplane disappeared 280 miles northwest of Point Barrow, an agency spokesman said. Point Barrow is the northernmost point of land in the United States. 
The plane, carrying a pilot and two polar bear specialists from the Fish and Wildlife Service, was to have returned Thursday to Prudhoe Bay.
