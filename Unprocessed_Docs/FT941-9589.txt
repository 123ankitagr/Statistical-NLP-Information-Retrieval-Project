The first of the larger building contractors will announce annual results on
Thursday, for the year to October 31. The big question is by how much new
chief executive Mr Oliver Whitehead, ex-Babcock International, will write
down McAlpine's assets following the departure of Mr Graeme Odgers, who took
over as chairman of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. Pre-tax profits
should have benefited from the recovery in the UK and the US, and are
expected to be about Pounds 6m before write downs, against Pounds 3.6m.
