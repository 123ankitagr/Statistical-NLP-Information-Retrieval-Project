Scientists working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have
discovered how two tumour-suppressor genes, called Rb and p53, co-operate to
prevent cancer in mice, writes Andrew Derrington.
Their results, described in this week's issue of the journal Nature, throw
light on the way the body controls the destruction of irreparably damaged
cells. The Rb protein acts during the development of the eye in the embryo.
It stops cells from dividing and causes them to differentiate into their
adult forms. If it is absent, the product of the p53 gene prevents the cells
from proliferating by inducing programmed cell death.
