Genc Polo, spokesman of the five-day-old Democratic Party, said a surprise meeting with Prime Minister Adil Carcani was a hopeful sign that they would be allowed to work with the Communist authorities to quiet unrest. Rioting unleashed last week by promises of political reform has died down, but at least 157 people who were arrested await trial on charges such as illegal assembly, looting, attempted murder and assault. Gramoz Pashko, a Democratic Party founder who also met with Carcani, said he asked that elections scheduled for Feb. 10 be postponed by several months.
