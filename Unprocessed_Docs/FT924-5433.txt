Sir, While I can sympathise with Prof Kennaway (Letters, November 17), it
would be wrong to disparage the entire British insurance industry simply as
a result of his bad luck. When I needed insurance for using Pounds 2,000-odd
of personal computer equipment in eastern Europe my household insurance
policy naturally did not cover it since it was for business purposes. The
insurance company I tried as an alternative did not cover eastern Europe, so
I asked my employer, which had some experience in eastern Europe, if it
could help. The office manager obtained the cover I needed with a couple of
telephone calls to her insurance broker. John A L Borgars,
