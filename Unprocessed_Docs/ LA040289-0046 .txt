Iraq has told 42 illiterate parliamentary candidates that they have been disbarred from running in Saturday's general elections. 
A statement by the ruling Revolutionary Command Council said candidates who did not know how to read and write had been dropped from the list of 952 people contesting the 250 seats in the National Assembly.
