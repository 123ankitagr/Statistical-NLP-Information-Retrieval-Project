A planned Dollars 1.6bn merger between the US railroads Illinois Central and
Kansas City Southern has been abandoned after the two sides failed to reach
agreement, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
Neither company would comment, but analysts speculated that a recent drop in
Illinois Central's share price scuppered the deal.
Under the terms of the original deal unveiled in July, Illinois Central, the
10th largest US railway system, was to have paid approximately Dollars 700m
in stock for Kansas City Southern, the country's 11th largest railway, and
assumed Dollars 929m in debt from the railway's parent, Kansas City Southern
Industries.
The union would have created a network spanning 14 midwestern and southern
states.
