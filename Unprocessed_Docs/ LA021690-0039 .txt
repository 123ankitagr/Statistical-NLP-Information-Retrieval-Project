Prince's New Movie Rolling: Prince's third dramatic movie, "Graffiti Bridge," began filming Thursday in Minneapolis-St.Paul. 
Prince will star, direct and score the film, described as a "new Hollywood musical" by co-producer Craig Rice. Morris Day and Jerome Benton will have big roles, as will Jill Jones, a singer who had a bit part in "Purple Rain." "Graffiti Bridge" chronicles the personality clashes between two nightclub owners. Warner Bros. has scheduled an August release. BETH KLEID
