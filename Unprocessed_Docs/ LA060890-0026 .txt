The race: Governor. Whose ad: Pete Wilson. 
In an effort to keep his name before the voters now that the primary election is over, Sen. Pete Wilson unveiled a second ad in as many days. 
This commercial emphasizes his fiscal record as mayor of San Diego between 1971 and 1982, in a subtle attempt to set himself apart from Democratic rival Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco.  Elements of the ad, with analysis by Times staff writer Richard C. Paddock. 
Ad: An announcer says, "As mayor of San Diego, he brought the first light-rail, mass-transit system to California." Wilson then says, "We built it on time, under budget and without federal funds." 
Analysis: Wilson initially was reluctant to support the trolley running from downtown San Diego to the border but ultimately was persuaded by its backers to get on board. Federal funds were not needed because the state picked up the tab. 
Ad: "Pete Wilson is the only candidate for governor who has balanced 11 straight budgets without raising taxes." 
Analysis: By law, both San Diego and San Francisco are required to balance their budgets. As mayor of San Diego, Wilson presided over 11 balanced budgets. As mayor of San Francisco, Feinstein presided over nine balanced budgets. However Feinstein, in her last year as mayor, left behind what her successor projected would be a $174.2 million shortfall.
