I couldn't help but notice that two readers wrote that Pete Rose should be inducted into Baseball's Hall of Fame regardless of whether he bet on baseball games. 
Where were those letter writers 70 years ago when Joe Jackson needed them? Jackson batted .356 in his career and makes Rose look like a bush leaguer. Yet he and seven Chicago White Sox teammates got lifetime banishments for fixing the 1919 World Series -- ironically, against Cincinnati. 
Jackson hit .375 in the Series he was supposedly trying to lose. 
Rose, yes, no question; but Jackson, no way? With such a confused moral position, is it any wonder Steve Garvey and Wade Boggs are in such a mess?
