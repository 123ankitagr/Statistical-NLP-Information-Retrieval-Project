The average number of rounds played by each golfer in the United States declined 7.7% in 1989 from the previous year, according to research by the National Golf Foundation released today. 
The average fell to 19.2 rounds per golfer from 20.8 in 1988. 
Total rounds declined 2.7% to 474 million from 487 million. 
The survey wasn't designed to identify the reasons for the decline, but researchers said Hurricane Hugo and record spring rains in the Northeast were two likely factors. 
"Whatever the reasons, our findings show that, while there were certainly more people than ever playing golf in 1989, they played on average a little less -- meaning relatively little growth overall for the golf industry," said Joseph F. Beditz, foundation president. 
Rounds played is one of the leading business indicators for the industry. In 1987 and 1988, annual rounds played increased 3% and 12%, respectively.
