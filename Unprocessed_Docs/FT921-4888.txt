THE SENIOR naval officer responsible for Britain's strategic nuclear
deterrent programme yesterday gave firm support to the principle of building
a fourth submarine for the Trident submarine fleet.
Rear Admiral Ian Pirnie, chief of the Ministry of Defence's Strategic
Systems Executive, told the Commons defence committee that remarks he made a
year ago were misinterpreted. He said his advice to ministers had always
been that four submarines were needed.
He made his remarks as the first Trident submarine, HMS Vanguard, was being
lowered into the water at Barrow-in-Furness.
He said it was possible to show 'on paper' that three submarines could be
sufficient to keep one on patrol at all times. But that would allow for 'no
contingency at all or insurance against any form of material defect, refit
delays, or anything else.'
Cancellation of the fourth submarine would save about Pounds 400m or 4 per
cent of the total cost of the fleet. 'For that 4 per cent we increase our
submarine availability by 50 per cent,' he said.
MoD officials would not say how soon the contract for a fourth vessel might
be signed. They told the committee the first submarine would enter service
on schedule in late 1994 or early 1995.
