ARGYLL, the UK's third largest food retailing group, is splitting its
Safeway and Presto/Lo-Cost chains into two separate divisions.
Mr David Webster, Argyll's deputy chairman, said the move was 'a tidying up,
rather than a fundamental change'. But he added that the new structure would
particularly benefit Presto and Lo-Cost which would be able to make more
effective use of Argyll's support functions as they strove to expand and
improve efficiency through new technology.
Mr Patrick Kieran, presently managing director of Safeway operations,
becomes managing director of the Safeway Stores division. His deputy will be
Mr Logan Taylor, now managing director of Safeway trading and marketing.
Mr Charles Lawrie, the Argyll director who has been responsible for Presto
and Lo-Cost for seven years, is appointed managing director of the
newly-created Presto and Lo-Cost Stores division.
Argyll acquired Lo-Cost in 1981 when it bought Oriel Foods - a food
manufacturing and retailing business which had been founded by the original
Argyll management team but then sold to RCA Corporation.
