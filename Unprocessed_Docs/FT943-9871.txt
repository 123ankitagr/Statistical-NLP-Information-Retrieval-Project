George Michael, the pop singer, yesterday filed an appeal against the High
Court's refusal to set aside his recording contract with Sony, the Japanese
entertainment company.
Mr Justice Jonathan Parker in June dismissed George Michael's claim that his
contract was an unfair restraint of trade and contrary to the European
Union's competition laws.
