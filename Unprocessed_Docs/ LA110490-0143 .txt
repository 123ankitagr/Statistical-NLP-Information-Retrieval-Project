CALVIN COOLIDGE and the Shah of Iran drank it religiously. Michael Jackson swigged it during his "Thriller" tour. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia has it imported to his palace. 
And the trainer of racehorse great Secretariat used it to water the legendary beast. So it was only a matter of time before L.A.'s glitterati began demanding the elite Mountain Valley Spring Water, which can now be delivered to your door. 
Carbon-dating has revealed that the ancient artesian spring in Arkansas began producing water 3,500 years ago, and that the water now reaching the surface fell as rain in 1500 BC. This calcium-rich water, never exposed to man-made contaminants, has been popular with every president since Coolidge. 
Bottled directly at the source, the cost is $13.50 for five gallons.
