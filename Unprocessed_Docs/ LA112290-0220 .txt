Three South Pasadena High School players each scored four goals to overpower Costa Mesa, 17-12, in the Southern Section Division 2-A water polo final Wednesday at Belmont Plaza. 
Dan Cherrie, Eric Norvedt and Tim Rohr combined for 12 goals as South Pasadena won its second consecutive 2-A title. 
Costa Mesa was led by senior Corey Delahunt, who scored eight goals. 
"I thought in the second half we were still in range," Costa Mesa Coach Jason Lynch said. "I figured it was out of reach about the fourth quarter." 
South Pasadena (26-4) led, 7-4, at halftime and was ahead 11-6 after three quarters. The lead was extended to 15-8, with 3 minutes 58 seconds left to play. 
"They didn't do anything in particular, they were just the better team," Delahunt said. "They took advantage of size a little bit, but what can you really say? They just beat us." 
Costa Mesa seemed to let down midway through the third quarter when it was unable to convert three counterattack opportunities. 
Costa Mesa (18-10) was competitive early, causing problems for South Pasadena offense in the first quarter. South Pasadena led, 3-2, after the first quarter when Ben Johnson scored in a six-on-five situation with 51 seconds left in the quarter. 
South Pasadena came out strong in the second quarter, quickly stretching its lead to 6-2 with 1:51 left in the half. 
But Delahunt scored twice in the next minute to pull Costa Mesa within two at 6-4. Cherrie scored with three seconds left in the half to give South Pasadena a 7-4 halftime lead.
