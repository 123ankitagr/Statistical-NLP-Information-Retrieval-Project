Sockers midfielder Brian Quinn, a Major Indoor Soccer League All-Star the past 3 seasons, is expected to be out for 3 weeks because of a strained left arch. 
Quinn, who has scored 20 points this season, hurt his arch during the Sockers' 4-3 overtime loss in Dallas Saturday night. 
It was originally thought that Quinn had torn a muscle in his foot and might miss up to 6 weeks. 
Coach Ron Newman also said that it is unlikely the Sockers will sign former Cleveland Force defender John Stollmeyer to replace recently retired Gary Etherington. 
Stollmeyer is a member of the United States national team, and Newman said he would miss nearly half of the Sockers' remaining games if he were signed. CHRIS ELLO
