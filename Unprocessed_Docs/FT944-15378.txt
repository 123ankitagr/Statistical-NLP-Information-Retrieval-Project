China has signalled that it wants to speed the entry of foreign companies
into the country's rapidly-growing insurance market. Speedier consideration
of applications for joint ventures involving foreign insurance companies is
been actively sought by the People's Bank of China, which regulates the
insurance industry. Mr Di Weiping, deputy director of the bank's
international department, told a conference in Hong Kong that, despite
growing rapidly, China's insurance industry 'cannot meet the needs of the
country's economic development'. For international insurance groups, the
Chinese market offers potentially vast opportunities: between 1992 and 1993
income from premiums in China increased by more than 40 per cent. But only a
handful of foreign insurance companies have made in-roads into the Chinese
market.
