Sir, Re Mr Leonard Dowsett's letter (May 8), the suggestion that ICI
invented polyester was the FT's, not ours. I am not aware that we have ever
made any such claim. I think the explanation may be simpler; a confusion
with polyethylene, colloquially known as polythene, which was indeed
invented by ICI.
