When it comes to generating extra work for themselves, accountants
traditionally win high marks. But Price Waterhouse's proposed scheme of
arrangement for the creditors of Trinity Insurance deserves a special
mention in dispatches.
A six-page letter in an appendix comes out strongly in favour of the scheme
suggested by the provisional liquidators, in preference to the alternative
of liquidation. So who are the provisional liquidators to whom the letter is
addressed? Partners at Price Waterhouse.
And who wrote the letter? A firm of accountants called, er, Price
Waterhouse.
