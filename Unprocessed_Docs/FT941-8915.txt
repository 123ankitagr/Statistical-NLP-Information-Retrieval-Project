How come John Major didn't include a doctor in his team for Moscow? Given
that there has been so much speculation about the health of Russia's
President Yeltsin, it might have been helpful if the PM's quack was on hand,

several months to come.
In the good old communist days, foreign governments often seemed more
interested in how long Russia's leaders would last physically rather than
politically.
When Harold Wilson visited the Kremlin in the 1960s, he took along his
personal physician with the sole aim of getting an arm's-length diagnosis of
whether Andre Gromyko, Russia's foreign minister, was nearing the end of his
innings.
Sadly, the only thing that Wilson's doctor could conclude was that there was
something wrong with Gromyko's jaw.
