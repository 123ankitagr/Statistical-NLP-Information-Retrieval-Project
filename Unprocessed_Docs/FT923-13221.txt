Hypertension is one of the most common causes of heart attacks and strokes.
It is more serious than high blood pressure: it is a silent killer: those at
risk may be quite unaware of it. All adults should know their blood
pressure. Those with chronically high blood pressure have five times the
chance of developing heart disease as those with normal blood pressure. The
ideal pressure is between 90/60 and 130/80. But what do these numbers mean?
As it pumps, the heart contracts, then rests, contracts then rests. During
the contraction phase, the pressure generated by the heart is transmitted
through the arteries to all organs. This pressure wave, measured by the
first number, should be no more than 130. Above that level the pressure may
be damaging the arteries, causing them to lose their elasticity and harden -
rupture or blockage could result.
During the relaxation phase, the pumping chambers fill with blood for the
next volley. The second number measures how well the heart is relaxing: a
reading of more than 80 could mean it is not working properly during this
phase.
Although blood pressure tends to creep up with age, other things can also
raise it. Overweight leads to high blood pressure, as fat is a vascular
tissue through which the heart must pump much harder. Stress also
contributes through the release of too much adrenalin, while heavy drinking
and lack of exercise can make matters worse.
The good news is that high blood pressure can be controlled with no side
effects. The first step is proper diagnosis and evaluation; the second is
treatment, through changes in both lifestyle and medication.
Do not decide that you have high blood pressure on the basis of one reading.
'White-coat hypertension', in which the high blood pressure is actually
caused by the doctor or nurse, is not uncommon.
For instance, you may be active, non-smoking, a light drinker, lithe, and
handle stress well. But at your annual company check up, your blood pressure
is 165/100. As your lifestyle is already blameless, should you be on
medication?
The answer is that any high blood pressure reading should be confirmed by at
least two further readings, or better still by 24 hour monitoring. Make sure
the measurement is taken after at least five minutes of rest, and that you
have neither smoked nor drunk alcohol or coffee for at least two hours.
If your blood pressure is still high - an average of at least 140/90 - buy a
well-calibrated blood pressure machine from the chemist and take your
pressure at home under less stressful conditions.
Once you have confirmed beyond question that you really do have high blood
pressure, ask yourself the following questions:
Do you consume large amounts of salt, fat or alcohol?
Have you put on a lot of weight in the last year?
Have you been particularly stressed or sedentary recently?
Is there diabetes in the family?
If the answer to any of these questions is yes, there may be a good reason
for the high reading, and a change in lifestyle could bring it down.
Many executives are initially annoyed to find their blood pressure is up,
and later relieved to discover that they were unwittingly placing themselves
at risk by getting too fat or drinking too much. Recent studies have shown
that lifestyle changes - weight reduction, salt restriction, and cutting
down on alcohol - lower blood pressure and make medication more effective.
If none of these apply, other measures to consider include: stress
management, exercise, giving up smoking, and getting professional advice on
your diet.
