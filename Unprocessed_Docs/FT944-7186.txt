China Everbright group, a diversified mainland conglomerate with activities
ranging from financial services to property development and trading, is to
pay HKDollars 555m (USDollars 72m) for a 5 per cent stake in National Mutual
Asia, the Hong Kong listed arm of the Australian insurance group.
The National Mutual Group will take an 8.7 per cent shareholding in China
Everbright-IHD Pacific, which is controlled by the Hong Kong listed China
Everbright International, for HKDollars 168m.
The deal is designed to further National Mutual's plans to penetrate the
mainland insurance market, which is gradually opening up to foreign groups.
Securing a China partner will help National Mutual enter the market and
develop business there.
Mr Wang Yake, the vice-chairman and chief executive officer of China
Everbright-IHD, will join the board of National Mutual Asia. A formal deal
is expected to be completed next month.
