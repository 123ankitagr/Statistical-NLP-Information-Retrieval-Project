Two defense alcohol experts testified that Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood would have had to consume more than a dozen shots of vodka and would have been staggering drunk if he had as much to drink as the prosecution maintains before his tanker ran aground in Prince William Sound. The two defense witnesses rejected a theoretical calculation of Hazelwood's blood alcohol content at the time of the spill last March 24.
