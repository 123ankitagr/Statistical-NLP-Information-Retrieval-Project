Friar Tux Shop presented its "Safe and Sober Prom" show to promote student awareness of the hazards of drinking and driving, at four local high schools this month. 
The program was produced in conjunction with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and the California Highway Patrol. The show was first presented at high schools last year. 
San Gabriel Valley programs were held at Ganesha High School in Pomona, and at West Covina, Temple City and Duarte high schools.
