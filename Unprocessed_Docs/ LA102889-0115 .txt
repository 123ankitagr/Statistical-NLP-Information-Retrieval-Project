Relatives of the late actress Amanda Blake claim that the owner of a south Sacramento County animal preserve coerced her into leaving her entire estate to the refuge. Blake's mother, sister and two cousins filed suit in Sacramento Superior Court this week, contending that the actress actually wanted to leave her estate to them. The suit said she was talked into leaving it to the Performing Animal Welfare Society three days before she died at age 60 in a Sacramento hospital on Aug. 16. Blake played Miss Kitty on television's "Gunsmoke."
