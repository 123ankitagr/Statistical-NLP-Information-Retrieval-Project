MR CHRISTOPHER Bailey, outgoing chairman of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers,
has sold 4.4m shares owned by his family interests at 10p each to the
Norwegian company which won control of the UK ship management company
earlier this year.
The shares were suspended at 8p on Thursday at the company's request because
it had started talks with Mr Andreas O Ugland, chairman-designate, and other
members of his family, regarding the proposed acquisition of a fleet of
vessels and a ship management business.
The Ugland family interests now have a total of 23.7m shares, some 29.7 per
cent of the share capital.
