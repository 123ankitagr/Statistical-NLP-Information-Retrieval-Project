New Start, an outpatient counseling center for drug abuse, has been awarded $15,500 in matching grant funds by the California Community Foundation. 
The 15-year-old center, 2500 Colorado Ave., provides services to individuals and groups, has developed outreach programs in middle and high schools, works with addicted mothers, maintains a 24-hour hot line, provides community speakers and serves as a resource for the courts and social service agencies. 
New Start, which must raise funds equal to the grant in order to receive it, will hold a benefit March 18.
