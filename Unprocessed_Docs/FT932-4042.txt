Mr Maynard Jackson, the mayor of Atlanta, has announced he will not seek a
fourth term for 'compelling personal reasons', Barbara Harrison writes from
Atlanta. The popular Mr Jackson, who recovered from heart surgery last year,
had been considered unbeatable in the election in October. Being without an
heir apparent, he leaves the political field open. Atlanta is solidly
Democratic and unlikely to change.
Mr Jackson, who in 1973 became the first black mayor of a large US southern
city, served the limit of two consecutive terms, then returned after Mr
Andrew Young, former US ambassador to the United Nations, had served two
terms. The biggest challenge facing the next mayor will be preparing to host
the 1996 Olympic Games.
