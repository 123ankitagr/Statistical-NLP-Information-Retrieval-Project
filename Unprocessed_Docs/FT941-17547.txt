The US and North Korea might be able to complete a deal on the inspection of
North Korean nuclear sites as early as this week, but further talks are
still expected to be needed before agreement can be reached.
The White House and the State Department said in official briefings that
progress had been made in talks between the two countries, and that further
announcements could be made soon.
'Certainly our dialogue has made some progress and we expect to continue our
discussions with North Korea,' said Mr Michael McCurry, the State Department
spokesman.
But a senior official later told news agency reporters that agreement could
come this week. The official appeared to imply that a deal might include
only a single inspection of seven officially declared North Korean nuclear
sites, leaving aside for the time being two sites holding reprocessed
nuclear fuel residues.
The International Atomic Energy Agency's demand last February to inspect the
two nuclear waste sites provoked North Korea's threat to withdraw from the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.
