Crimea's parliament yesterday rejected an appeal from President Yuri Meshkov
for the power to rule by decree, AP reports from Simferopol. Mr Meshkov, who
became president of the rebel Black Sea peninsula in January, told MPs he
needed emergency powers to push through economic reforms. He stormed out of
parliament after his plea was rejected.
