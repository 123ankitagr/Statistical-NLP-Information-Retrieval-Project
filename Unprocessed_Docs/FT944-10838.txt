Spending on advertising in all the main media sectors increased in the
second quarter of the year, with particularly strong increases in radio and
poster spending, according to figures released today by the Advertising
Association.
The figures show the continued recovery of the advertising business from
recession, said the association, which is a federation of advertising trade
associations and professional bodies.
Advertisers spent a total of Pounds 1.2bn at current prices on press
advertising in the second quarter of this year compared with Pounds 1.1bn in
the second quarter last year.
Television advertising spending increased to Pounds 624m in the second
quarter from Pounds 564m last year, posters to Pounds 94m from Pounds 80m
and radio to Pounds 51m from Pounds 43m.
Spending in colour supplements is the only area to show a decline - a fall
of almost 12 per cent at constant prices.
The association said the fall 'reflects the changing definition of
'supplements' within newspapers, rather than a weakening market'.
Advertisements for office equipment increased, at constant prices, by more
than 38 per cent in the second quarter, compared with the second quarter
last year. Pharmaceuticals rose 37 per cent, while financial and household
equipment advertising rose 24 per cent.
At the other end of the scale government advertising fell 26 per cent,
agricultural and horticultural 18 per cent and drink 15 per cent. ---------------------------------------------    INCREASES IN MEDIA SPENDING BY SECTOR* ---------------------------------------------
