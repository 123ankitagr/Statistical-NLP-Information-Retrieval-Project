White Sox first baseman Ron Kittle needs four to five months to recover from removal of a herniated disc from his lower back, his doctor said. 
Kittle, 31, who was hitting .302 with 11 homers and 37 RBIs when he went on the disabled list June 19, underwent the surgery Thursday. 
Dr. Michael Schafer, who performed the operation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said the surgery was successful. 
He said Kittle, a designated hitter and first baseman, should recover in four to five months and should be able to return to baseball next season.
