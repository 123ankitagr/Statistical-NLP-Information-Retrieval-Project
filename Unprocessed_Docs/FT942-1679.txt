A 50 per cent increase in government road spending would not be enough to
prevent an increase in traffic congestion, says a report commissioned by the
British Roads Federation.
The report, by Professor Douglas McWilliams, head of the Centre for Business
and Economic Research, says that increasing the road budget of about Pounds
2bn a year by a further Pounds 1bn would still lead to a 4 per cent rise in
congestion by the year 2010. If present spending plans were maintained
congestion would increase by just more than 10 per cent.
The federation said it wanted to quantify the impact of road spending to
head off the threat of cuts in the next Budget.
Ms Joan Walley, who speaks for Labour on transport, said the report failed
to take account of the need to set roads in a wider policy framework
including improved public transport and better land-use planning.
The report, which was issued yesterday, says more road spending would have a
positive impact on the economy with a 50 per cent increase leading to an
annual saving of Pounds 4bn on the costs incurred by road users by 2010. A
50 per cent cut in road spending would increase annual costs to road users
by Pounds 6bn by 2010. Just over half of these costs would be incurred by
industry.
The report says higher road spending would have environmental implications
but these would be far outweighed by cost savings. Much new building
involves improvements to roads which reduce congestion and cut pollution. If
road spending were to increase by 50 per cent the environmental cost would
amount to only 2 per cent of the cost savings.
