Forty-five Japanese companies have joined forces to commercialise plastic
optic fibre that would make laying the country's information super-highway
more practical and dramatically reduce its cost. The move could speed
Japan's entry into the multi-media age.
The consortium, which includes Mitsubishi Rayon, the world's largest
producer of plastic optical fibres, NEC, Fujitsu, and NTT, aims to
commercialise high-quality plastic optic fibre (POS) developed by Mr
Yasuhiro Koike, an assistant professor of applied science at Keio
University.
The optical fibre at present in use for communications purposes is made of
glass. The problem is that connecting different strands of glass fibre is
difficult, making the connectors used for that purpose highly expensive,
according to Mitsubishi Rayon.
Plastic optical fibre, on the other hand, is easily connected, reducing the
cost of connecting fibres from as much as Y30,000 (Pounds 194) for each
connection to as little as Y10.
It had been thought that plastic fibre, because of its limited transmission
capacity, was unsuitable for multi-media services, which call for the
transmission of huge amounts of data. The new plastic optical fibre
developed by Mr Koike has been able to overcome this shortcoming and is
capable of transmitting from one to more than 2.5 gigabits of information
per second, or equivalent to the amount required to send several television
channels down one multi-media line.
Mitsubishi Rayon expects plastic optical fibre to serve different needs from
glass optical fibre, which is likely still to be used for main trunk lines.
Development of the improved plastic optical fibre has attracted US
companies, with Boeing expressing interest in licensing the technology.
News of the development supported a strong rise in the share prices of
companies involved. Mitsubishi Rayon, for example, enjoyed an 11 per cent
increase on the day to Y472 in active trading. NEC rose Y10 to Y1,220.
