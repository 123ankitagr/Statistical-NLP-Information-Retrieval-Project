A long and costly effort by the the Australian federal government to
extradite Mr Christopher Skase, one of Australia's high-flying entrepreneurs
in the 1980s and head of the now-collapsed Qintex group, appeared to have
collapsed yesterday when a Spanish court upheld his appeal and freed him.
The full bench of the Audiencia Nacional, Spain's highest court, made its
decision known only indirectly and it was several hours before Australian
officials learned of it. The court's reasons are not likely to be known
before Monday.
Australia had sought his extradition so he could face 32 charges arising
from the collapse of his media and resort empire in 1989. The failure left
corporate debts of around ADollars 1.5bn (Pounds 680m) and additional
personal debts.
