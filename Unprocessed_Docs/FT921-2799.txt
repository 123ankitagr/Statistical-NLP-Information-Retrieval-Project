THE PAY gap between senior civil servants and comparable private sector
white collar workers is no longer justifiable, according to a
union-commissioned report by Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, the consultancy
firm.
Senior civil servants have traditionally received less pay than private
sector counterparts because their jobs are more secure. The report says
there is ample evidence of a higher turbulence and job changing in the
private sector.
