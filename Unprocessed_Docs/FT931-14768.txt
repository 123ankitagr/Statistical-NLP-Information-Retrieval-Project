A MEETING of workers at Cleveland Iron decided yesterday against industrial
action in response to the Teesside plant's closure, announced earlier this
week by British Steel. The 200 men instructed Iron and Steel Trades
Confederation officials to urge British Steel to avoid compulsory
redundancies by seeking volunteers.
