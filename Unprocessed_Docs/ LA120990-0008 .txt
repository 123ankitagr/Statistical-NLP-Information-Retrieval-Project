Me, I like to putz in the kitchen and regard 
fat garlic and hum about nothing. Make it up. 
Word 
for blues. 
Like dragging down the street 
in a hundred-and-four heat -- you know 
when air temp tops body temp, how buzzed 
and weird 
you get? Word for trance. So this character 
taps me: remember me, mon amie? Name's 
Breeze. Then she dictates most fabulous. I'm 
blessed. She's benign. Word for pixilated. 
She's a scholarship girl at the School of 
Fine Arts 
so she drags me down the line to an out-of-town 
show. Rattle express. Word for 
kismet. This lady with the face of an old walnut 
sits by us making lace with an eye-fine 
hook and when the train dives into the tunnels 
she keeps working in the dark. Word's 
exquisite. Breeze sings 
scat all the way to the opening: 
sculpture of heating ducts, stovepipes and stones. 
Breeze is prole to the bone. The tablecloth's 
splattered with blood of the lamb, 
wine on the lace. The critic pronounces 
optimism 
vulgar, and asks: Why have there been so few 
great women artists? 
We ask ourselves. The word is 
jerkoff. Breeze, who is terrifyingly fluent, 
challenges him to sew a bride's dress. From 
scratch. Femmes aux barricades! The critic 
can't weave 
a cat's cradle. Breeze spits: By hand. French lace.
