Almost 30 per cent of UK businesses are already connected to the Internet,
market research findings showed yesterday.
The study, conducted by Hi-Tech Marketing on behalf of Pipex, an Internet
service provider, was based on responses from 300 companies and other
organisations.
More than 95 per cent of those not connected to the Internet, the informal
system of computer networks which connects databases and computers across
the globe, expect to do so within the next 12 months.
Among those who are connected, most believe its use as a communications tool
outweighs its use as an information service. More than two-thirds use the
Internet most frequently to send electronic mail - to customers, suppliers
and employees elsewhere in a group.
Almost half - 49 per cent - of the respondents listed file transfer as the
second most frequent use, followed by sourcing and providing information,
listed by 40 per cent. Software distribution was cited as the fourth most
important application.
Ernst & Young, the accountancy firm, plans to provide its analysis of the
Budget on the Internet less than 12 hours after the chancellor addresses the
Commons on Tuesday. The announcement follows the Treasury's decision to
publish the Budget speech on the Internet via Pipex.
