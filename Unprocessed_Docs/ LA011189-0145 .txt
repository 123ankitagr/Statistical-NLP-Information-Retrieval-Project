Mayor Tom Bradley launched a bid for an unprecedented fifth term today, less than a week after his strongest potential challenger, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, declared the mayor unbeatable and withdrew from contention. 
The 71-year-old Democrat was first in line outside the City Clerk's office when it opened today, the first day candidates could file to run in the April 11 election. "This is official, No. 1, to file my declaration for mayor of Los Angeles," he said. Only one other person was on hand at 8 a.m. to file for the mayor's race.
