TSB, the sixth largest UK banking group, is to close down TSB Private Bank
International, its loss-making Luxembourg private banking operation set up
in 1987.
The operation became part of the Hill Samuel Private Banking Services in
July last year. It employs 42 people. Hill Samuel said yesterday that the
decision to shut down the operation followed a strategic review of the
group's private banking activities.
