Forty-eight students who took over the president's office at Stanford University to advocate more minority faculty members and administrators pleaded no contest to trespassing charges and were sentenced to six months' probation. The students, who were arrested after invading university President Donald Kennedy's office in May, also were ordered by a Santa Clara County judge to perform 40 hours of community service each.
