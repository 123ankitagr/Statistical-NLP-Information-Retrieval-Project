Black & Decker Suit Settled: It cost Black & Decker Corp. $21 million, but the Towson, Md., company has won assurances that a New York investor group will drop a lawsuit attempting to block Black & Decker's $2.8-billion takeover of Emhart Corp. Topper, which is offering $2.4 billion, or $35 a share, for Farmington, Conn.-based Emhart, agreed not to increase its bid and promised that neither it nor any of its affiliates would acquire any Black & Decker stock for 10 years.
