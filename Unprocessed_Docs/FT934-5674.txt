The title of BBC1's documentary Doctor Who: 30 Years In The Tardis (BBC1,
8.00) is a bit of a misnomer since the BBC decided to kill off its famous
creation while he was still in his twenties. They are now reduced to showing
repeats. The good doctor is one of the BBC's most successful characters.
This programme brings together Jon Pertwee, Colin Baker and Sylvester McCoy
who all played the title role.
ITV's three-part drama A Woman's Guide To Adultery (9.00), based on the
novel by Carol Clewlow, is all about mistresses. Rose, who disapproves of
adultery, has three friends who are having affairs with married men. When
she goes back to university she suddenly finds herself succumbing to
precisely the same temptation. A strong cast includes Theresa Russell,
Amanda Donohoe and Sean Bean.
After so many documentaries about the armed services and the police, C4
begins a two-part programme about the Royal Navy's own police force in
Cutting Edge: 'Navy Blues' (9.00). Drugs, homosexuality and desertion all
feature in this opening episode.
