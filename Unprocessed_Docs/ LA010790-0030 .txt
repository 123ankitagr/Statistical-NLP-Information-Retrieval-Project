I am shocked to read that professionals who deal with children believe that "children don't lie." 
Where on earth are their real-life experiences with children? And don't they know of Lawrence Kohlberg's famous study at Harvard that shows that children don't develop a moral code until they are 7 or 8? 
Hasn't anyone considered the possibility that the children were playing doctor and that the little girl, rather than saying, "We were playing doctor and I enjoyed it," projected onto the little boy's father the injury? 
I admire the Johnsons for insisting that their story be told.
