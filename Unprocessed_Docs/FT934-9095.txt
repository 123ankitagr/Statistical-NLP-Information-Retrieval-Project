A SALES manager for a gaming machine company was told to change her
'unprofessional' hairstyle because it made her look as if she was going to a
disco, an industrial tribunal was told yesterday.
Miss Tracey Gatehouse left her Pounds 9,000-a-year job with Stretton Leisure
after being told she should tie her hair back because it gave the wrong
corporate image. She has said she was also warned that her good looks might
make pub landlords' wives jealous.
Miss Gatehouse, of Warrington, Cheshire, is claiming constructive dismissal,
sex discrimination and compensation for unequal pay at the Liverpool
tribunal.
Miss Valerie Crook, the company's personnel manager, said she had been told
that the managing director did not feel Miss Gatehouse's hair was
professional enough or business-like enough for her job.
