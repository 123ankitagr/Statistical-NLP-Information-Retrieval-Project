Singer Janet Jackson postponed two concerts this week in Detroit after passing out backstage in the middle of a St. Louis show. 
Jackson, 24, collapsed Sunday after singing three songs. 
She was taken to a hospital, treated for an acute viral infection and released, Kathleen Heinz, a spokeswoman for the St. Louis Arena, said Monday. 
A doctor recommended Jackson not perform for at least four or five days, Heinz said. 
Jackson, the sister of Michael Jackson, has suffered from exhaustion during her "Rhythm Nation" tour and had come down with a fever and an ear infection that caused dizziness the day before she passed out, Heinz said. 
The Detroit concerts had been scheduled for today and Wednesday but were moved to Aug. 22 and 23.
