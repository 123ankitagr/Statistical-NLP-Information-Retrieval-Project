A group of loud, angry residents crowded into the Westminster City Council chambers Tuesday night and voiced opposition to a mobile-home park expansion project that would narrow two city streets and bring high density to their neighborhood. 
Resident Don Heise, who opposes the plan of Lee Miller, owner of Los Alisos Mobile Home Estates, said Miller's project is poorly designed because it "would eliminate sidewalks, reduce the width of city streets and result in more traffic." 
The City Council took hours of testimony from nearly two dozen supporters and opponents, then voted 5 to 0 to postpone a decision on Miller's plan pending further study by city staff. The project has pitted hundreds of angry residents against Miller, a heavy political campaign contributor to city council races, who is trying to expand his 665-unit park an additional 121 spaces. 
Miller, has asked the City Council to give him about 15 feet of city property and the rights to a flood-control channel the size of six city lots. 
Miller wants to reduce the width of Lee Drive from 60 feet to 45 feet and Dorothy Drive from 60 feet to 43 feet. As proposed, the expansion would make Miller's one of the largest parks in Orange County. 
Miller's 665-unit Los Alisos Mobile Home Estates is one of Orange County's largest and most expensive parks with rents exceeding $550 a month. 
As Heise spoke against the plan Tuesday night, many residents, including an overflow audience of 60 who sat in chairs outside the chamber and watched the proceedings on television, applauded and gave shouts of support.
