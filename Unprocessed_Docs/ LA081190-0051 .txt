During a two-day undercover operation this week in Logan Heights, police arrested 35 people for felony drug sales to police officers, San Diego police spokesman Dave Cohen said. 
Of the 35 arrested, 24 were undocumented aliens, he said. 
The Wednesday and Thursday operation resulted in arrests mainly for sales of marijuana and cocaine, but a few were for methamphetamine.
