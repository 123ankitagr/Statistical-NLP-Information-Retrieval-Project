Why no go Pogo? Whither our Okefenokee? The world here in Fort Mudge needs every day to meet the enemy. 
He is us. He is not Marmaduke. Whither our Christmas Carol? Our Christmas Albert. Our warnings that Friday 13th comes on a some Tuesday soon? Who got to you? The muddled masses who didn't get it? 
Oh please. So much drivel in the comics and you pick on the ghost of Walt Kelly -- so well conjured by Doyle-Sternacky. Please advise. Please paddle out in your rowboat and think about it. 
I go Pogo.
