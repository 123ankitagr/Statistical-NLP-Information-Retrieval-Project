A hundred demonstrators, including activist-actors Martin Sheen and Ed Asner and several Los Angeles clergymen, were arrested again this week for blocking access to the downtown Federal Building in protest of U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
The action marked the sixth weekly civil disobedience protest at the Federal Building by a coalition of religious leaders and peace activists since the slaying of six Jesuit priests and two women in El Salvador. 
No arrests have been made in the November slayings, which the protesters believe are linked to the U.S. government-supported military forces of El Salvador. 
The protesters, cited for trespassing on federal property, linked arms to keep employees from entering the building. Before their arrests, a series of speeches were delivered by health-care workers and AIDS-care activists against U.S. involvement in El Salvador. 
Father Don R. Kribs, chaplain at County-USC Medical Center, called on the U.S. government to redirect military spending to help improve health-care programs here and in El Salvador.
