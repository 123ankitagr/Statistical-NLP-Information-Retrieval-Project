Don Henley has a gripe against his ex-band mate, Joe Walsh, who is touring with Ringo Starr and performing what Henley describes as "the phony version of 'Life in the Fast Lane.' " "I don't know why he feels compelled to do that song," Henley told the Baltimore Sun. "Nobody else is doing that kind of thing. I'm sort of puzzled as to why he doesn't do one of his own songs. But I never could figure the guy out, so why start now?" Henley said he not only sang that Eagles classic on the original record, but also wrote "about half of it." Walsh, on the other hand, "really didn't have hardly anything to do with it. He wrote the little guitar riff that's in the introduction of the song, and that's basically all." Shauna Snow
