President-elect Bush, who will attend the Feb. 24 funeral for Japanese Emperor Hirohito in Tokyo, said he is not worried about possible criticism over honoring the emperor of a wartime enemy. "We have a good relationship with Japan. I want to see it even better," said Bush, a former Navy flier whose plane was shot down by the Japanese in the Pacific in 1944. "I feel you look ahead, not always look back." Bush, who will become President on Jan. 20, said he has no plans to visit other Asian countries during the trip. He is expected to be accompanied by James A. Baker III, his choice for secretary of state.
