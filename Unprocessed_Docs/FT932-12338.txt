PRESIDENT Bill Clinton is unlikely to reveal new policies regarding the
Bosnian crisis before next week, according to the White House.
Ms Dee Dee Myers, the presidential press secretary, would neither confirm
nor deny speculation that Mr Warren Christopher, the secretary of state,
would visit Europe for consultations before the US and its allies announced
their next moves.
But she drew attention to Mr Christopher's testimony to Congress on Tuesday
in which he had spoken of the importance of ensuring American public support
for any decision. This implies that Mr Clinton himself, plus other members
of the administration, may try to lay out policy options in speeches and
elsewhere in the days ahead.
The president himself said after meeting congressional leaders late on
Tuesday that 'new questions, some new issues and some interesting arguments'
had been discussed.
But he dropped no hint as to whether he was leaning in favour of allied air
strikes, lifting the arms embargo on Bosnia, continuing the course of
sanctions and diplomatic pressure, or in what combination.
Gen Merrill McPeak, the US air force chief of staff, told a Senate
appropriations sub-committee that bombing Serbian artillery positions in the
former Yugoslavia would be completely effective and pose 'virtually no risk'
to attacking aircraft. He said the relatively scarce and unsophisticated
surface-to-air weapons available to the Serbs would make the aerial campaign
'virtually no risk to ourselves'.
Nato chiefs have not excluded the use of air strikes in Bosnia but have
warned about serious difficulties and risks involved in such a policy.
US military officials confirmed yesterday that General Colin Powell,
chairman of the US joint chiefs of staff, had held informal talks with Nato
colleagues about options for intervening in the war, including the use of
bombers.
