POHJOLA, the biggest Finnish insurance group, reported a dramatic surge in
operating loss for 1991 due to heavy claims stemming from its foreign
insurance business.
Operating loss jumped to FM588m (Dollars 129.5m) from FM108m a year earlier,
but the directors proposed paying a maintained dividend of FM1 per share.
Profit from Pohjola's domestic direct insurance and reinsurance business was
wiped out by underwriting losses of FM614m in its foreign insurance business -compared with a loss of FM97m.
Miss Pirkko Alitalo, director and chief financial officer, said the loss
arose because foreign insurance claims were much larger than originally
expected.
