New York socialite and aspiring actress Cornelia Guest was sued Monday for allegedly not paying the rent on her $5,000-per-month Beverly Hills home. 
The lawsuit, filed in Superior Court by Guest's landlord, Marlene Morris, contends Guest failed to pay rent that was due March 1. Guest rented the house on Hutton Drive in May, 1989. In her suit, Morris is seeking to evict Guest and receive $25,000 in damages at the rate of $166.67 per day plus punitive damages. 
Guest, whose renown is based in part on her being "Deb of the Year" of New York and a past romantic link to actor Sylvester Stallone, could not be reached for comment.
