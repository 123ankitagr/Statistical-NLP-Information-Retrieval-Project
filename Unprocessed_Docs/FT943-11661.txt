Officials in South Korea yesterday expressed strong doubts about a claim by
a senior North Korean defector that his country possesses five nuclear
bombs, John Burton reports from Seoul. They said there was no evidence to
support the claim by Mr Kang Myong-do, the son-in-law of the North Korean
prime minister. Seoul says North Korea has the plutonium but has been unable
to convert it into bombs. Similiar assessments were offered by officials in
Washington and Tokyo, although they did not totally dismiss Mr Kang's
information.
