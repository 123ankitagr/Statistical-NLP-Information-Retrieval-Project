The free-lance writer who wrote Margo Adams' version of her affair with Wade Boggs for Penthouse magazine said he had acquired a copy of baseball's confidential report on Pete Rose's alleged gambling, but rejected a deal to sell it. 
David D. Schumacher refused to say how he had obtained the report, who had bid for it or how much was offered, although he did say that he had rejected one $20,000 offer. 
Schumacher attempted to sell the 225-page report to The Times, which declined his offer.
