The Lorimar Studios changed the name of the Robert Taylor Building after producers and tenants complained in a petition that the late actor testified before Congress against Hollywood artists. 
The petitioners wanted Taylor's name banished because the actor testified before the old House Un-American Activities Committee against the so-called Hollywood 10, and he was considered a supporter of the Hollywood blacklist. 
Arnold Shupack, senior vice president and general manager of Lorimar, was given the petition in September, and the name change was approved on Nov. 15, his office said today. 
Shupack changed the structure's name to the George Cukor Building. Cukor directed most of his films on the lot Lorimar took over from MGM. 
Before MGM sold the lot, the 74-year-old building was called the Lion Building. When Lorimar took over two years ago, the studio changed the name of the old buildings in favor of honoring former movie stars. 
Taylor died of lung cancer in June, 1969.
