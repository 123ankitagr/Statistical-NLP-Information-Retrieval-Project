Microsoft, the big US software group, has been ordered to pay Dollars 120m
in damages for infringement of data compression patents held by Stac
Electronics, a small software company. The ruling could have broad
consequences for the personal computer industry.
Microsoft's widely-used personal computer operating system, MS-DOS 6.0,
contains data compression features that infringe patents held by Stac, a Los
Angeles court has ruled.
The costs of the ruling could be much higher if Microsoft is forced to halt
sales of MS-DOS, even temporarily. Stac said that it would immediately seek
a permanent injunction against Microsoft to prevent further infringement.
The patent infringement ruling could affect the entire industry. Most
personal computers are shipped with Microsoft's MS-DOS operating system
software pre-installed. Technically, any sales subsequent to the court
ruling could constitute further patent infringement.
Stac Electronics' data compression technology doubles the amount of data
that can be stored on a personal computer hard disk file.
Doug Clow, president and chief executive of Stac Electronics said he held
licensing negotiations with Microsoft in 1992, but the companies had been
unable to reach agreement. Subsequently, Microsoft introduced MS-DOS 6.0, a
new version of its PC operating system that includes data compression
technology.
The court ruled that Microsoft's data compression method infringed Stac's
patents. However, the jury determined that the infringement was not
'wilful'.
The court also awarded damages of Dollars 13.6m to Microsoft, for Stac's use
of trade secrets relating to 'undocumented' features of MS-DOS. Mr Clow said
Stac had 'reverse engineered' an element of Microsoft's product to make its
data compression software compatible with MS-DOS.
