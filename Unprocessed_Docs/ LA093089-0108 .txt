The president of Azusa Pacific University has announced he will resign to take a job as president of another university. 
Paul E. Sago, 58, who has headed Azusa Pacific since 1976, declined to name his new school but said it is in Southern California. 
This week the school's Board of Trustees accepted his resignation, which is effective Jan. 31, 1990, and lauded him as "a strong and effective leader." 
Board Chairman Ted Engstrom said the school will soon launch a search to find a replacement for Sago. 
Founded in 1899 by the Quakers, Azusa Pacific is a liberal arts school of about 2,700 students now affiliated with evangelical Christian organizations.
