How do you motivate people doing dirty jobs in anti-social hours? That,
according to the Local Government Chronicle, was the challenge facing Mervyn
Montacute when he arrived from New Zealand to become managing director of
Westminster City Council.
His particular problem was the council's 'sex department', part of the
section which licenses sex shops and places of entertainment. Its intrepid
squad travels round Soho 'deliberately sampling what is on offer so they can
give evidence in court', according to Montacute.
Since New Zealand is at the forefront of introducing private sector
disciplines into its public sector, Montacute knew what he must do to
galvanise his front-line staff.
'We've put them all on performance-related pay; it is working very well.'
