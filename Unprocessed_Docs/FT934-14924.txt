The world of human resource management - still known as personnel in some
quarters - is often a vital element in corporate life. Slotting round pegs
into round holes is never as easy as it sounds; yet the personnel department
and its leadership is not the centre of gravity for many companies.
But that is changing, according to Chris Brewster, director of the Cranfield
school of management's centre for European human resource management, who
has just been created professor in the same faculty.
'What is happening is that human resource management has always been
important for companies, but now it is becoming much more visible. As
companies have to become more cost effective, they have to learn how to
manage their human resources much more cleverly than in the past,' says
Brewster.
Brewster's research shows half of all companies in Europe now have a human
resource director on the board; he believes that percentage will increase in
the next few years.
It is certainly an area of corporate life where there currently seems to be
a flurry of activity in the UK.
Don Young, formerly director of organisation and personnel at Thorn EMI, has
joined REDLAND as its director of human resources; David Garth, previously
with Sears, has moved to the newly-created post of head of human resources
at TARMAC, reporting to group chief operating officer John Lovering; Raymond
Bainbridge is taking over as head of personnel of HONEYWELL'S European
control components division; Andrew Mayo has moved at ICL from being its
European personnel director to the company's director of human resource
development; and Marc Dufour is moving from the US to become group personnel
director for NORTH WEST WATER.
British Telecom's group personnel director, Richard Worsley, is taking a
three year secondment from BT to become director of the Carnegie Third Age
programme, which, among other things, seeks to promote employment and
educational opportunities for people aged 50 and over.
