Claremont Mayor Alex Hughes, 52, died Monday, apparently of a heart attack. 
Hughes was elected to the City Council in 1986 and had served as mayor since April. Mayor Pro Tem Nick Presecan will take over until the council decides whether to appoint someone to serve out Hughes' term, which ends next April, or to leave the seat empty until then. 
Hughes, who also was associate superintendent of Claremont schools, had lived in Claremont for 23 years.
