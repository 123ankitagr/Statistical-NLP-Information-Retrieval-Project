Notes: The Orange County Coaches Assn. poll and the Southern Section Coaches Poll picked the top four teams to be: 1. Capistrano Valley, 2. Corona del Mar, 3. El Dorado, 4. El Toro. That will likely change as Villa Park beat El Dorado in sudden death overtime to open the season last Tuesday. Long shots to crack the Top 10 include San Clemente, Buena Park, Canyon and Edison. San Clemente won the 15-and-under section of the Junior National tournament but still might be a year, or even two years away from the finals. . . . Corona del Mar has a new pool that might be the best in the county. UC Irvine's tournament was held there last weekend. The Sea Kings, three-time defending 4-A champion, will face their first big test Tuesday when they play host to defending 3-A champion El Toro. . . . Edison looks like the top team in the Sunset League with four returning all-league players. . . . The season's best indicator of top teams will come Sept. 27-29 in the South Coast League tournament.
