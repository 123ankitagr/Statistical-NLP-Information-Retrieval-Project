A Taiwanese cabinet committee has approved several previously announced
trade reforms as part of the island's bid to join the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade this year, Reuter reports from Taipei. The cabinet's Gatt
Strategy Committee passed proposals to ease Taiwan's ban on rice imports,
change fees levied on users of its ports and alter its tobacco and liquor
import tax system.
