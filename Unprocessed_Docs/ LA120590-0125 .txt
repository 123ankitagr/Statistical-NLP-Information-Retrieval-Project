Don R. Griffin, a 17-year veteran of the City Council, was chosen this week as the city's next mayor. 
Griffin, the owner of an architectural firm, has been involved in public service for more than 25 years. 
He served as a member of the Buena Park Library District for eight years before joining the council. 
"Hopefully, I have a pretty good idea what to expect," said Griffin who has served as mayor five times. "Having been through different eras, it helps bring a clearer focus to decisions." 
The yearlong term is mostly ceremonial. Responsibilities include conducting meetings and representing the city at outside functions. 
Stepping down is former Mayor Donald L. Bone, who dealt with several critical issues during his tenure. 
"Don has had a very successful year," Griffin said. "He has done an outstanding job," Bone helped to prevent malathion-carrying helicopters from being based permanently at neighboring Fullerton Municipal Airport. He also instituted Vision 2010, a plan to get residents involved in planning Buena Park. 
Also this week, newly elected Councilman Arthur Brown was sworn in. Brown, a retired deputy sheriff, filled the vacancy left by Councilman Kenneth B. Jones, who did not to seek reelection. 
Councilwoman Rhonda J. McCune was chosen to serve as mayor pro tem. LYNDA NATALI
