By a vote of 356 to 45, the House sent to the Senate a bill (HR 2570) setting aside 1.1 million Bureau of Land Management acres in Arizona as federal wilderness to be permenantly protected against degradation. 
The measure opens an additional 950,000 BLM acres to uses such as mining and grazing. 
It is one of a series of bills Congress has taken up in recent years to preserve large wilderness areas in most states. 
Supporter Morris Udall (D-Ariz.) said people should have "the strength, the courage and the wisdom to leave at least these places as we found them." 
Opponent Bob Stump (R-Ariz.) called the bill "an overzealous effort to protect public lands from human intrusion." 
Members voting yes supported the wilderness bill.
