ABBEY National, the second-largest mortgage lender, yesterday said it was
widening its margins by cutting interest rates on some of its accounts by
more than the cut in its mortgage rate announced last week.
The bank, which shed its building society status in 1989, is cutting gross
rates by 0.95 of a percentage point on the highest band (Pounds 25,000 plus)
of Instant Saver, its instant access savings account, and by 0.7 of a point
across the board on its High Interest cheque account.
Its interest-bearing current account will continue to pay 0.5 per cent
gross.
The bank's mortgage rate was reduced by 0.51 of a point to 7.99 per cent on
loans of less than Pounds 60,000 in response to last week's 1 point fall in
base rates.
Abbey National said it had to widen its margins. If it had passed on to
borrowers the full base-rate reduction, it would have had to cut savings
rates by even more. It suggested that cuts to its 90-day savings account
would not be as great as on Instant Saver.
Rates on lower balances in the Instant Access account are being reduced by
smaller percentages.
The reduced savings rates come into effect today while existing borrowers
will have to wait until March 1 for reductions to monthly mortgage payments.
