Following are capsule reviews of today's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas: 
'Tribute to the National Film Board of Canada: Oscar Nominated Animated Films' 
Canada, 89 minutes 
8:25 p.m. 
This second program of NFB shorts showcases experimental and/or multimedia works: "Christmas Cracker" by Norman McLaren and "Monsieur Pointu" by Bernard Longpre and Andre LeDuc blend live action with stop-motion animation. Peter Foldes' "Hunger," the first computer-animated film to be nominated for an academy award, features ugly line figures utterly unlike the bright, three-dimensional objects in this year's winner, "Tin Toy. " Ryan Larkin uses simple ink wash drawings to express an unallayed joy in pure movement in "Walking." RECOMMENDED. CHARLES SOLOMON
