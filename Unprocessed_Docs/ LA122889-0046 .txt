Raisins and rum flavor this coffeecake, ideal for serving at a New Year's Eve or New Year's Day breakfast or brunch. 
It's easily prepared using thawed frozen bread dough, rolled out into a square. Spread with filling, roll up tightly and cut into pinwheels. After placing in a tube pan, let the dough rise, then bake to golden brown. 
RUM-RAISIN RING 
1 (1-pound) loaf frozen bread dough 
1/2 cup boiling water 
3/4 cup raisins 
1/3 cup sugar 
1 teaspoon rum extract 
2 tablespoons melted butter 
Allow bread dough to thaw until pliable. Pour boiling water over raisins and let plump 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly. 
Roll dough out to 12-inch square on lightly floured board. Combine raisins, sugar, rum extract and butter. Spread over dough. Roll dough up tightly, jelly-roll fashion, pinching along edge to seal. Cut roll into 16 to 20 pieces. 
Arrange pieces in greased ring mold, tube pan or bundt pan. Let rise until doubled. Bake at 375 degrees 25 minutes or until golden brown. Invert immediately onto serving platter. Makes 8 servings. 
Note: To thaw dough in microwave oven, wrap frozen loaf loosely in plastic wrap. Microwave on LOW 6 minutes, rotating occasionally.
