Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep has withdrawn from the film version of "Evita," citing exhaustion, and the film has been postponed until a new star is found, the producers said today. 
Director Oliver Stone said Wednesday: "I still want very much to see 'Evita' made. I am looking toward the future and the new singers/actresses that are coming up." 
Filming was to have started on the musical in Seville, Spain, next February. The film was to be based on the hit stage musical on the life of the late Argentine President Juan Peron's second wife, Eva Peron.
