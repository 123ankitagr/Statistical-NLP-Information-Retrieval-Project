The Los Angeles City Council on Wednesday gave final approval to an ordinance intended to close loopholes used by landlords to increase rents beyond city-mandated limits for rent-stabilized apartments. 
In an unanimous vote, the council approved changes in the 10-year-old rent stabilization ordinance that eliminate a landlord's right to remove apartments from rent control by making substantial capital improvements to the units. Also eliminated was a landlord's right to evict tenants while doing major rehabilitation work, then re-rent the units at market rates. 
New rules also were established for dealing with repair costs -- from new faucets to carpets or appliances.
