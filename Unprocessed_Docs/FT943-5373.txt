The Russian government has reinforced recent attempts to bring some order to
the country's chaotic advertising market by banning the MMM investment fund
from advertising in state-run media. MMM, a pyramid investment scheme which
sucked in millions of shareholders, has continued to run extensive
television advertising campaigns despite the collapse of its share price,
the arrest of its founder and government claims that MMM investment
certificates are little more than 'pretty postcards'. Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin, Russia's prime minister, has also instructed state-run media
not to run advertisements by 'organisations attracting investments from
individuals and legal entities in violation of existing laws'. Last week,
the Russian government approved a draft law proposing stiff regulation of
Russia's nascent advertising market. It is not clear whether MMM will be
able to evade government restrictions by limiting its advertising to private
television stations.
