The Italian film company that co-produced "The Last Emperor" is going to build a $17-million film studio in Singapore. Due for completion in about two years, the complex will be used for indoor shooting by Cecchi Gori Summit Studios (Singapore), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Italian Cecchi Gori company. Singapore's Economic Development Board (EDB) has been offering tax and other incentives to encourage foreign film makers to work there. ALEENE MacMINN
