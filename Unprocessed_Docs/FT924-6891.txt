THE Treasury is being forced to seek outside advice to improve its
decision-making because of the view that it has made mistakes, Mr Howard
Davies, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry, said
yesterday.
Mr Davies said one reason for the Treasury's efforts to step up
consultations with outside economists and industrialists was to give it
'alibis' in case policy-making errors were repeated.
Speaking at an Association of European Journalists lunch, Mr Davies, a
former Treasury official, said the Treasury habitually 'internalised'
discussions on economic policy. The Treasury's view - justifying its
customary secrecy - was that 'information, power and control (were)
synonymous'.
As controller of the Audit Commission, the government public spending
watchdog, Mr Davies helped advise the Treasury on reforming its internal
management structure.
He said the traditional Treasury approach was 'fine as long as you're
winning'. But if the Treasury made 'mistakes' it alone received the blame,
since the importance of external advice even from the Bank of England - was
seldom acknowledged. Signs that it was seeking more outside contacts were a
'sea change'.
Mr Davies, who criticised the government's handling of the departure from
the exchange rate mechanism, predicted that it might have difficulty in
maintaining its anti-inflation credibility. s
