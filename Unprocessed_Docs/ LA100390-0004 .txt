In response to "Assigned-Risk Rates to Rise Average of 85%," Sept. 20: 
Now that my auto insurance is being raised from $575 to $1,000 per year (I have assigned-risk insurance because my car is old, 1965 model), I suppose I should jump for joy for getting a discount from the insurance companies when they get both feet in the door with good old no-fault. No way. 
I'm going to give myself a 100% discount; no more insurance until the state gives me affordable insurance. I would like to see the state add an insurance fee ($200) to the license fee on every vehicle. 
This probably will never happen because it would be asking our politicians to put their hands back in their own pockets.
