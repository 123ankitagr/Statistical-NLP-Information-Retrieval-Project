I happened to catch the Times Shopper article on Sami crafts by Jennifer Merin in the June 24 Travel Section. 
By fortuitous coincidence, I discovered a Lapp (Sami) movie at the Laemmle Fine Arts Theatre: "Pathfinder." The movie recounts a 1,000-year-old Lapp legend of a young boy who saves his people from murderous invaders and features Lapp actors speaking the Lapp language. It's a fascinating view of another time and culture. Anyone who found your article on the Sami traditional techniques in craft-making interesting would enjoy "Pathfinder" as well.
