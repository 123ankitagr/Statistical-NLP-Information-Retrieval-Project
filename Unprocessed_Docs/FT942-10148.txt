Cleveland's four district councils are to become unitary authorities on
April 1 next year, leaving elections until the following month, Mr David
Curry, local government minister, announced yesterday. The decision is
subject to the outcome of Cleveland County Council's application for a
judicial review of the proposals.
Mr Curry said the arrangement reflected the 'particular circumstances in
Cleveland' and did not set a precedent for any future cases.
