The body of a Linda Vista businesswoman was found stuffed in the trunk of her car Tuesday by San Diego police who were sent to the woman's home by employees who became concerned when she did not arrive at work. 
Deborah Barksdale, 38, owner of Barksdale Office Planning, apparently died of asphyxiation, a San Diego police spokesman said. The exact cause of death will not be known until an autopsy is completed today. 
Her body was discovered at 9:33 a.m. Barksdale lived in a condominium complex in the 1500 block of North Rim Court. Police had no suspects on Tuesday.
