INCENTIVE, the Swedish industrial group controlled by the Wallenberg family,
is set to become the world's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling
equipment after agreeing to buy MacGregor- Navire from Kone, the Finnish
elevators group.
The acquisition will strengthen the position of Incentive's materials
handling company, Hagglunds Marine, and create a unit with annual sales of
more than SKr2bn (Dollars 245m). Payment is in the region of SKr500m,
although exact details are not being disclosed.
Hagglunds is the world's leading supplier of shipboard cranes. Acquiring
MacGregor will expand its product range to include hatch covers, marine
elevators, roll-on, roll-off equipment and cargo lashing equipment.
It will have a market share of between 50 and 60 per cent, according to Mr
Mikael Lilius, Incentive president.
Mr Lilius said: 'We think it is a good time to buy as the order books of
both companies are growing, and they are benefiting from the devaluation of
the Finnish and Swedish currencies.'
He added that MacGregor-Navire's international network of 50 offices in 24
countries would greatly enhance Hagglund's own sales and service network.
This is Incentive's most significant purchase since it gained a stock market
listing in 1991. In two years of rationalisation, it has raised Dollars 400m
from selling businesses and cut net debt by SKr3bn.
