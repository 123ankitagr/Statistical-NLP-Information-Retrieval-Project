What's in store for Angel fans as the team begins its seventh season affected, in one way or another, by labor unrest? If history is indicative, it could be a long season.

ANGEL DUST SETTLED 
Except 1985, when they finished a game out of first place, the Angels have played five other seasons marred by strike, boycott or lockout since the introduction of divisional play in 1969. They finished an average of more than 20 games behind the Western Division leaders and only as high as third (at that, 26 games behind). In the 15 other seasons since 1969 (during which they won three divisional titles), the Halos have finished on average 14 games out of first.
