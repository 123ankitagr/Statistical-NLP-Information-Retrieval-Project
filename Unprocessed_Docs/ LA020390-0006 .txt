For over 20 years, at work or at play, in my car or at the games, I'll always remember that famous bellowing voice announcing such superstars as Garvey, Wills, Chamberlain, West, Gabriel, Youngblood, Dionne and Berry. Whether I was in a good mood or bad, it was always a pleasure to hear that ever-present foghorn. 
Thanks for the memories, John Ramsey.
