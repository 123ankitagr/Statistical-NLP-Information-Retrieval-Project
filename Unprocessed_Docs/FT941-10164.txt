Robe River Iron Ore Associates of Australia, a joint venture in which North
Broken Hill Peko has a 53 per cent interest, yesterday announced that it had
agreed to cut iron ore prices by 14.5 per cent, following negotiations with
the Japanese steel mills.
It said that, in return for the large price reduction, the Japanese buyers
had agreed to take at least 12.5m dry long tons of Robe River ore in
1994-95. The Robe River venture produces iron ore fines at operations based
in Western Australia's Pilbara region.
The price cut is more substantial than that announced on Tuesday by
Hamersley Iron, part of the CRA group, after 'unusually complex and lengthy'
negotiations. Hamersley said that it was cutting prices by an average 7.6
per cent - made up of a 9.5 per cent reduction for fines and one of 5.9 per
cent for lump ore. Hamersley agreed a minimum delivery of 19m tonnes,
unchanged from 1993-94.
Broken Hill Proprietary, the large Australian steel and natural resources
group, also announced yesterday that it had agreed to a 7.6 per cent price
for iron ore to be delivered from its Mount Newman project in the Pilbara,
with the same split as Hamersley between fines and lump.
BHP said, however, that contracts for its Yandi and Goldsworthy projects had
yet to be finalised.
