Question: My blood pressure is 180 over 110. My doctor has tried Minipress, Capoten, Calan and Tenex. Each brings my blood pressure under control but causes impotence. 
Within days of stopping, my erection returns. Is there any blood pressure medicine that doesn't interfere with an erection? I hate to give up sex at the age of 48. 
Answer: Is it possible that you could lower your blood pressure without medicine? If you are overweight, losing the spare tire can often make a big difference in blood pressure. Exercise, special diet (more vegetarian fare without salt) and relaxation techniques can all be helpful. Consult your doctor about such a program. 
Although you have tried a number of different medicines, there are many other options. 
A urologist may be able to work with your regular doctor to find the right drug for you. Our most recent book, "50 Plus" (Bantam Books), has a chapter on sexual side effects of medicine, including an analysis of blood pressure pills. 
Q. I am a health-conscious 67-year-old woman. I eat oat bran twice a day and watch my diet very carefully, with no red meat, eggs or dairy products. Even so, my cholesterol is around 220. 
I was fascinated to read that Metamucil can lower cholesterol. I don't need the laxative action. Can it be eaten dry or sprinkled on cereal, or does it have to be put in a glass of water? 
A. Metamucil and other psyllium-fiber products might cause trouble if they are taken dry. Intestinal blockage has been reported in some persons who have not gotten enough liquid into their system to keep this fiber moving. 
Although Metamucil can reduce high cholesterol levels by 5% to 15%, check with your doctor before you slave to lower your cholesterol any further. 
Unless you have other risk factors such as high blood pressure or heart disease, a cholesterol level of 220 might not be too dangerous for a woman your age.
