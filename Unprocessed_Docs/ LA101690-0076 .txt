Sales of North American-made cars and light trucks fell 2.1% in early October, continuing a slump that began when the 1989 model year ended last September, the companies said Monday. 
The auto makers sold cars and trucks during the Oct. 1-10 period at an average daily rate of 30,096, compared to a rate of 30,734 during the same time last year. 
Car sales, spurred by an increase among General Motors Corp. vehicles, rose 1.9% while truck sales dropped 9.5%. 
Car sales by the Big Three -- GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. -- dropped 1.5% while sales of domestically made cars with Japanese nameplates rose 42.6%.
