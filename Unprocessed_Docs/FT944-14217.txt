With German interest rates on hold - Thursday's Bundesbank council meeting
is expected to make no changes - bond dealers are trying to extract glimmers
of comfort from monetary and economic indicators.
They did not find many in Friday's M3 figures. Although they showed a
continued slowdown, traders said they were higher than expected.
September's annualised growth rate was 7.7 per cent, compared with a 1994
target range of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent. However, the rise on a
six-month annualised basis was a far more encouraging 2.9 per cent.
If October's west German inflation rate, which is likely to be released this
week, eases to 2.9 per cent, bond prices could improve.
A further slowdown in M3 expansion would help further, since it would
stimulate the hopes of those expecting the Bundesbank to cut rates by early
1995 before tightening again. However, the Bundesbank is in no hurry to move
either way, especially with economic recovery accelerating.
The German economy needs no help from the Bundesbank in the short term.
However, the bank is concerned about the budget deficit and structural
rigidities in the economy. These are what will increasingly underlie its
actions, even if inflation and wage trends do moderate.
