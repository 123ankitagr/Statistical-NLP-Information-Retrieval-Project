One day after winning the Preakness Stakes, jockey Pat Day shared in a triple dead heat victory, only the 18th in modern thoroughbred history, at Arlington International Racecourse Sunday. 
The dead heat came one race after Day rode Quality Exchange to victory the $44,360 Smart Deb Stakes. 
In the ninth race, an $18,000 seven-furlong allowance for 3-year-olds, Day rode 9-5 favorite All Worked Up, which tied with Marshua's Affair and Survival. All three colts were timed in 1:24.4. Juvenal Diaz rode Marshua's Affair and Jorge Velasquez rode Survival. 
The triple dead heat was the first at an American track since Dec. 31, 1981, at Suffolk Downs in Massachusetts.
