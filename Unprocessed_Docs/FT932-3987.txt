The magnetic strip which appears on credit and debit cards has proven, in
many cases, to be woefully insecure, with the data easy to copy. Now
academics at Keele University, with industrial help from three companies,
have developed a security strip which fraudsters should find almost
impossible to tamper with.
The magnetic medium is sputtered in tiny drops onto the surface - paper,
metal or plastic - so it is impossible to peel off, unlike ordinary magnetic
strips. And the data held in the medium is encoded to prevent copying.
Massvision, which is marketing the strip and associated equipment, can write
instructions on to the strip so that only one other specific machine can
write on to that surface. This would mean that only the company issuing the
cheques, tickets, credit cards or holograms would be able to write on the
strip, preventing copying.
The genuine items could be easily verified at the retail outlet by using the
reader. Massvision: UK, tel: 021 708 0041.
