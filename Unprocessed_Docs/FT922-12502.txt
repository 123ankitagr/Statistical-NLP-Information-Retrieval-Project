MR Alan Greenspan, US Federal Reserve chairman, sought to reassure financial
markets yesterday that recent sharp falls in Japanese share prices would not
have serious effects in other countries.
Testifying before the Senate banking committee in Washington, he said the
Fed's unexpected decision last week to cut short-term interest rates by a
quarter-point to 3.75 per cent reflected weak growth of the money supply and
bank credit. It was not a response to sharp falls in Japanese share prices.
'In my judgment, the impact on the US from Japanese stock price changes to
date is likely to be limited.'
Mr Greenspan said Japan would continue to export capital, provided it ran a
current account surplus, regardless of share prices falls. Shifts in the
composition of capital exports might cause some price adjustments in
overseas markets but these 'need not be terribly disruptive'.
Japan held only 2-3 per cent of US Treasury securities and an even smaller
fraction of equities.
He said falls in Japanese share prices might lead to retrenchment by
Japanese banks, but world-wide credit conditions 'will not be substantially
weakened by a scaling back by Japanese banks'.
Japanese share price falls could have a significant negative effect on
Japanese investment and hence on growth. However, 'the separate contribution
of the stock market decline to weaker Japanese demand for US exports is not
expected to be large.'
