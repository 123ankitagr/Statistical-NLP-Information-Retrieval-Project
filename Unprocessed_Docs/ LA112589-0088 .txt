A City Council session called Friday to mark the second anniversary of Mayor Harold Washington's death was scratched when only about a dozen of the city's 50 aldermen showed up. 
Although some attributed the low turnout to continued divisions on the council, most called it a question of scheduling and said the city's first black mayor would be honored Monday instead. 
Mayor Richard M. Daley's press secretary, Avis LaVelle, said notice was too short. The gathering was announced by Alderman Robert Shaw on Wednesday afternoon. 
"This is not some sinister plot," LaVelle said. "It's a reality of the holiday season. Many people had longstanding vacation plans or arranged to take today off."
