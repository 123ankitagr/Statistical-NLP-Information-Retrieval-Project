Hikers have found the skeleton of a 70-year-old man who was sought in the September slaying of his wife, a case featured on the television show "Unsolved Mysteries," authorities said. 
Joe Frisino of the King County medical examiner's office identified the man Monday as Joe Lynn Owens. 
An autopsy will determine the cause of death. 
"It's a sad ending to a sad case," said homicide Sgt. Joe Ritter. "I wish he would have at least left something to tell us why he did it." 
Owens disappeared Sept. 7, the day after police questioned him about the disappearance of his 78-year-old wife, Gladys. Her body was found Sept. 14 under a false floor below a compost pile at the couple's west Seattle home after police acted on tips. She died of a gunshot wound to the back of the head. 
King County police Maj. Jackson Beard said investigators were called to a trail about 30 miles east of Seattle on Sunday after two hikers found a human back bone. 
Police searched the area Monday and found more bones, clothing, Owens' hearing aid, glasses and a gun.
