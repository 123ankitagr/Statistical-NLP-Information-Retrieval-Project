AMERICAN Express has filed a countersuit against MasterCard International in
New York, alleging false advertising of business credit cards and unfair

MasterCard previously sued American Express over an American Express
Corporate Card advertising campaign.
American Express maintained that the MasterCard suit had no merit.
