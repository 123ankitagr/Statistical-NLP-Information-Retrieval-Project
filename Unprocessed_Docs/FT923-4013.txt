The proliferation of regulators called Ofthis and Ofthat is getting
seriously out of hand. Oftel, Ofgas, Offer and Ofrail are now to be joined
by Ofsted, the Office for Standards in Education - which is the name for the
revamped schools inspectorate launched yesterday. The old title, Her
Majesty's Inspectorate, was a well-established brand name with an honourable
history which no sensible marketeer would lightly abandon.
Where will it all end? The Test and County Cricket Board could become
Offstump. The Lord Chamberlain, Offstage. The Commission for Racial
Equality, Offcolour. The Press Complaints Commission could become
Offlicence; the new national lottery, Offchance. The immigration service,
Offlimits. David Mellor, Offside. (That's enough Off. . . Ed)
