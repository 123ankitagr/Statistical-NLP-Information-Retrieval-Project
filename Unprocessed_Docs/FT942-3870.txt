Hans Heckmann, an executive vice president of Union Bank of Switzerland, is
to join the UBS board next year and will replace Robert Favarger as vice
chairman. Heckmann's job as head of corporate and institutional banking will
disappear at the end of the year when his division merges with the corporate
finance, primary markets and merchant banking divisions under Pierre de
Weck, currently in charge of the corporate finance division.
