CHINA IS considering opening its non-ferrous metals mines to foreign
investment and broadening its own investments in copper mines overseas,
according to the China Daily, reports Reuter from Beijing.
The official newspaper quoted Mr liu Wanling, an official at China National
Non-ferrous Metals Industry Corporation, as saying that his country was keen
to raise its production of restricted metals like aluminium and copper and
would seek overseas capital to enable it do so.
China has eased shortages of most non-ferrous metals with the exception of
copper and wants to mobilise foreign investment to exploit overseas copper
mines, Mr Liu said.  Officials have inspected mines in Australia, South
America, Africa and Russia.
'We hope to raise foreign funds to construct copper mines in foreign
countries,' Mr Liu said, although he acknowledged that would not be easy as
the world's best mines were already occupied.
China's broader reah overseas would coincide with the opening of its
non-ferrous mines to foreign capital, especially for zinc, lead and other
metals abundant on the mainland, he said.
China had begun negotiations on proposed joint ventures in the non-ferrous
metals industry that would be far larger than the 220 existing joint
ventures, Mr Liu said.
China's long-term hope is to raise per capita consumption levels closer to
world standards, thereby boosting production.
For example, the Chinese consume less than 1kg of aluminium per head a year,
far below the 20kg to 30kg in industrialised countries.
