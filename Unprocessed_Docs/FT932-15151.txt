THOMAS COOK, one of Britain's biggest travel agents, gave a new twist to the
war over business air fares yesterday by offering yet bigger savings to its
corporate clients in exchange for a fee.
Mr Bill Kirkwood, sales and marketing director, suggested that savings of up
to 40 per cent were possible on corporate travel. However this would eat
into the agency's traditional income, derived from a 9 per cent commission
on the price of an air ticket.
Following similar plans in the US, Thomas Cook is also offering to manage
corporate travel spending. It wants to bypass companies' in-house travel
managers and provide spending reports directly to budget holders.
American Express, one of Thomas Cook's rivals, said that it was already
offering similar cost-management services to corporate clients.
