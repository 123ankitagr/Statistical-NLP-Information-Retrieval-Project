CITROEN, part of the Peugeot group of France, is launching a new generation
large family car in March to replace its 10-year-old BX range, writes Kevin
Done, Motor Industry Correspondent. The car will be named Xantia, a break
from the recent Citroen practice of naming cars with letters such as AX and
ZX. It will follow French rival Renault, which has also switched to names
such as Clio and Safrane.
The Xantia, pictured, was styled in collaboration with Bertone, the Italian
design house.
