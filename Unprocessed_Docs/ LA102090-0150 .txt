In round two of TV's heavyweight clash between "The Simpsons" and the Huxtables, "The Cosby Show" opened a lead Thursday night after finishing in a virtual dead heat with Fox's cantankerous cartoon clan the week before. 
NBC's "Cosby" was seen in about 17.2 million homes, compared to about 15.1 million for "The Simpsons." 
Nonetheless, Fox executives said that they were thrilled with the showing because, among the teen and young-adult viewers that Fox and its advertisers prize most, "The Simpsons" has been beating "Cosby" handily. "Cosby's" rating is bolstered by heavy viewership among people over 50. 
In Los Angeles, "The Simpsons" continues to be the No. 1 choice, as 39% of all television sets in use between 8 and 8:30 Thursday night were tuned to Fox-owned KTTV Channel 11. "Cosby" was the choice of 26% of the area's viewers. STEVE WEINSTEIN
