Maynard Jackson III, the son of Atlanta's mayor, was fined the maximum $150 after he pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor charge of marijuana possession. 
The action came Tuesday in Atlanta Traffic Court, where Jackson also was found guilty of a charge of following too closely. 
Jackson was charged after a Jan. 9 traffic accident in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood, a day before his 19th birthday. Police said they found several marijuana cigarettes in his car.
