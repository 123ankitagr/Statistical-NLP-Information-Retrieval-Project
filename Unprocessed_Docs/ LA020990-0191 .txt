A Valentine's Day concert by LaToya Jackson has been canceled because her presence would violate the values of Malaysian culture, the Culture and Tourism Ministry said today. 
The department secretary, Mukhtar Abdullah, said Jackson, who posed nude in Playboy magazine last year, did not meet some of the conditions imposed by the government on foreign artists performing in Malaysia. He did not say what these conditions were. 
He said he was surprised the promoter, Genesis Promotions, went ahead through newspapers and television ads without getting the ministry's approval.
