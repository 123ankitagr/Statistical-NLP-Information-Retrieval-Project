East Timorese protesters flashed victory signs as their bus left the US
embassy in Jakarta, where they staged a 12-day sit-in. The 29 protesters
were on their way to catch a flight from Indonesia on the first leg of their
journey to Portugal, where they have been granted political asylum. Timorese
youths have been in the vanguard of fresh protests against Indonesian rule
of the former Portuguese colony.
