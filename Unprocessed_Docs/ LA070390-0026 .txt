A woman who left her twin daughters in the mall at Fashion Valley to avoid an arrest for shoplifting pleaded guilty Monday to child abandonment and petty theft. 
Della May Youngblood, 20, of La Mesa, who is also known as Delia Washington, entered her pleas before San Diego Municipal Judge Allan Preckel. 
She faces one year in jail when she is sentenced July 30. 
The 2-year-old girls were taken to Hillcrest Receiving Home on June 19 after the incident occurred. They are now living in a temporary foster home, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Sickles, and further hearings are expected in Juvenile Court concerning their custody. 
Youngblood is pregnant and was in custody Monday at the County Jail at Las Colinas in lieu of $15,000 bail. 
Security guards tried to arrest her on suspicion of stealing three dresses from the J.C. Penney store. Youngblood left her daughters in a stroller and took off in her car, said the prosecutor.
