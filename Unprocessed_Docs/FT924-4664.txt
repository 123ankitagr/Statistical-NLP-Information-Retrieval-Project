MAY Department Stores, the St Louis-based retailer that includes the Payless
shoe store chain, said yesterday that it had asked the board of Morse Shoe
to provide information on a proposed merger with J. Baker, the footwear
group, and that May might be willing to make a rival offer of Dollars 55m
for Morse Shoe.
The company said that the purpose of acquiring Morse would be to step up its
presence in the north-eastern US generally and in the New York area in
particular.
May said that, if the bid went ahead, it would be an all-cash offer.
