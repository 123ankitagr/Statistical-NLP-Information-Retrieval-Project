Former President Richard M. Nixon has a heart disturbance that is not life-threatening but is reducing his stamina, an aide said today. 
His doctors advised him to cancel his schedule for two weeks. 
The former President, 77, was not admitted to the hospital after the problem was discovered during an examination at the Cornell University Medical College in New York City. He will recuperate at his home in Saddle River, N.J. 
Dr. Jeffrey Borer, a cardiologist at the hospital, said the ailment is a benign supraventricular heart rhythm disturbance. He said electrical signals that cause the heart to beat are being generated abnormally.
