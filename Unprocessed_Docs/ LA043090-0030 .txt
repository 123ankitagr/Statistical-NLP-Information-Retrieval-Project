"THE HELLSTROM CHRONICLE"(U.S., 1971; D: Walon Green. Century Plaza 3, 7 p.m.). The narrative device is slightly absurd, but, back in 1971, this film's microphotography of insects at work and war blew audience's minds. It still should. Part of the David Wolper Tribute. (Michael Wilmington) 
"KINDERGARTEN"(USSR: 1985; D: Yevgeny Yevtushenko. Fairfax, 9:15 p.m.) First film by the famed Russian poet: uneven, flamboyant, deeply personal, semi-autobiographical.(Michael Wilmington)
