U.S. to Study 'Globalization' of Mass Media: The United States may need updated communications policies, the government said in announcing that it will study the "globalization" of the mass media. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration said it will seek to determine how widespread the globalization of the media has become, noting that current policies, such as limits on foreign ownership of U.S. communications concerns and cross-ownership prohibitions, need to be re-examined.
