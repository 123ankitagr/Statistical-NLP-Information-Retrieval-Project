South Korea yesterday accused North Korea of violating the 1953 armistice
agreement that ended the Korean war by threatening to withdraw from the
military armistice commission.
North Korea said it would try to dismantle the commission unless the US
agreed to conduct negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce pact.
Pyongyang has violated the armistice agreement 'which provides that this
document may be amended or supplemented only by agreement between the
parties involved,' said the National Unification Board in Seoul.
Both the US and South Korea have said they will not consider the peace
treaty proposal until the North Korean nuclear inspection issue is resolved.
North Korea has refused to attend meetings of the armistice commission,
which helps supervise the 40-year old truce, since March 1991 when a South
Korean general was appointed chief delegate for the UN forces.
Pyongyang boycotted the meetings because it claimed South Korea was not a
signatory to the armistice agreement, which was signed by North Korea and
China on one side and the US-led UN forces on the other.
South Korean analysts believe North Korea is trying to gain several
advantages by raising the peace treaty proposal and linking it with the
nuclear issue.
The most important goal is to exchange nuclear inspections for a peace
treaty that would eventually lead to the withdrawal of US forces from South
Korea and weaken relations between Seoul and Washington.
The proposal is also part of the North's strategy to eliminate South Korea
from the current nuclear negotiations. The North is seeking direct
high-level talks with the US on possible diplomatic recognition, but
Washington has refused to hold discussions until Pyongyang accepts full
nuclear inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites.
Another motive behind the North's action is to blur the international focus
on the nuclear dispute.
'It's their way of moving the goalposts and obfuscating the issue,' said a
US official.
