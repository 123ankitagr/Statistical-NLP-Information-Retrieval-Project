Many lonely, isolated Latina girls need emotional and social support. They live with their parents or in foster homes -- and Big Sisters of Los Angeles is trying to help them. 
The agency has opened a branch office to better serve Latino families, with help from a grant from the Irvine Foundation. The City Terrace-based office is seeking Latina volunteers to help girls aged 6 to 16 all over Los Angeles County build their self-esteem and enjoy positive new experiences. 
Women 21 or older who can be a special friend to a young Latina may volunteer by calling Big Sisters at (213) 268-1041 or 933-5749. A Big Sister must commit three to five hours a week to her Little Sister for at least one year.
