Spotting Miss America during her Missouri Capitol homecoming was easy -- just look for her official escort. 
A dozen state troopers, deputy sheriffs and Capitol Complex police, many in dress uniforms, walked Debbye Turner through visits with the governor, both chambers of the Legislature, and individual officeholders Wednesday. 
Turner, an Arkansas native who is the first Missouri resident to wear the Miss America crown, also addressed the House and Senate after talking to 400 children in the Rotunda. 
Turner explained how others told her she could never be Miss America because she is black and too short and because her talent -- marimba playing -- was too oddball for pageants. 
"If this marimba-playing, 5-foot-7 minority can be be Miss America, then you can do anything," she said.
