Regional development agencies from around Europe have formed the European
Association of Development Agencies (EURADA) to influence the European
Communities policies on small business and regional development.
Eighty agencies are expected to become members of the association which was
launched at a meeting in Brussels last month. Four UK agencies - Greater
London Enterprise (GLE), West Midlands Enterprise Board, Lancashire
Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise - are among the founding
members.
The agencies believe that the community's small firms policies need to be
better focused.
