South Korea sought to open a channel of communication with an increasingly
isolated and intransigent North Korea yesterday to defuse the row over
nuclear inspections before a June deadline, Reuter reports from Seoul. Mr
Hwang In-sung, South Korean prime minister, in a letter to Mr Kang Song-san,
his northern counterpart, proposed a high-level meeting next week 'for the
sake of national well-being'.
