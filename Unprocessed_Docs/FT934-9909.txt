German M3 money supply grew at a revised annualised rate of 6.8 per cent in
September after a 7.2 per cent rise in August, according to the Bundesbank,
Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The central bank had initially reported that M3 grew at an annualised rate
of 7.0 per cent in September. The rise is calculated by comparing annualised
M3 growth with the average level of the last quarter of 1992. The
Bundesbank's target range for M3 money supply growth this year is 4.5-6.5
per cent.
