DEBT issued by four holding companies in the Bronfman business empire has
been downgraded to below investment grade by Canada's Dominion Bond Rating
Service.
DBRS said the downgrade, which affects Brascan, Hees International Bancorp,
Trilon Financial Corp and Great Lakes Power, reflected the inability of
companies in the Bronfman group to raise new debt or equity.
The rating on Brascan's senior debt has been cut to BBB High from A Low.
Hees' senior-debt rating has dropped to BBB from A High. Trilon is down to
BBB from A. The rating on Great Lakes' commercial paper has fallen to R-2
High from R-1 Low.
