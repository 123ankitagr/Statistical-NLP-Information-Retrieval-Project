Where does Mr. Stern draw the line when deciding where a team is putting forth its best lineup? How many minutes must each starter play? Will he also decide whether each player is giving his best effort? If Mr. Stern is going to hand out fines for coaching decisions, he should explicitly state the rules, and not leave it up to the coach to divine the league's vague expectations.
