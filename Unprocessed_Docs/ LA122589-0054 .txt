The Soviets pull out of Afghanistan and allow all their "satellites" to freely choose their own form of government, be it communist or not. The United States stages a massive military invasion of Panama, a tiny sovereign country, and installs its chosen candidate as the new head of state. Now which is the "evil empire?" 
Members of the Panamanian Defense Forces resist the United States invasion of their country, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell calls them "thugs" and terrorists. United States armed forces invade Panama City at night, helicopter gun ships blazing, blow up the Panamanian army headquarters, in the process killing dozens of men, women and children living nearby, and untold others in streets. Now who are the terrorists? 
The Reagan Administration raised "double speak" to a new level, and the Bush Administration has done the same.
