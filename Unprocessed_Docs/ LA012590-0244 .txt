The White House Historical Assn. today announced a campaign to collect $25 million in donations to provide permanent funding for the collection of fine paintings and furnishings in the executive mansion. 
First Lady Barbara Bush arranged an afternoon reception in the State Dining Room to announce the creation of The White House Endowment Fund, which will handle the fund-raising drive. 
Association Chairman Melvin Payne said in the announcement that "the historic character of the White House and its furnishings are a national treasure. We must assure for all the generations to come, the White House continues to be a beautiful and accurate reflection of our history and culture."
