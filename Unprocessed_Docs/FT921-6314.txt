JAPANESE commuter trains are infamous for their overcrowding. Even though
'salary men' on Tokyo's Yamanote line may be too squashed to read their
newspapers, they are now able to watch television.
JR East Japan has installed 24 liquid crystal display television sets, each
with 8.6in screens, above the windows on the walls of its carriages. More
than 1,000 carriages on the line have been fitted with the Sharp
mini-screens.
