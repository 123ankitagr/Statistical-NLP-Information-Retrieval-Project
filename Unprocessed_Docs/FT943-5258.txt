Manders, the coatings and ink manufacturer, is expanding in New Zealand
through a NZDollars 35.5m (Pounds 14m) deal.
It is buying Morrison-PIM Holdings, which makes printing inks, for NZDollars
27.5m and the assumption of NZDollars 8m of borrowings.
In the year to June 30 1994 Morrison made an operating profit of NZDollars
3.9m (NZDollars 3.2m) on unchanged turnover of NZDollars 45.8m.
Manders said that the purchase would complement its existing New Zealand
business, which was acquired from Croda in January this year.
