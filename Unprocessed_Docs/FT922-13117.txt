THREE BIDS for First Capital Life Insurance Company, the ailing San
Diego-based life insurer, had been received by last week's deadline.
The company was seized by the Californian regulators in May after its parent
company went into bankruptcy and a run by policyholders had developed.
The separate proposals came from Transamerica Life Occidental Insurance
Company; Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company; and from Leucadia National
Corporation, the New York-based conglomerate, in conjunction with First
Capital's creditors' committee.
The three proposals pose alternatives to a rehabilitation scheme, entailing
a Dollars 50m capital injection, put forward by Shearson Lehman Brothers,
the investment banking subsidiary of American Express.
Shearson was closely involved with First Capital, holding a 28 per cent
stake in the parent company, First Capital Holdings, and selling First
Capital policies to its own clients. The bidders have until April 17 to
revise offers.
