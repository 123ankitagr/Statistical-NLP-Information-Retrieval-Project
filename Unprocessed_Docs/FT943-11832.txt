French culture minister Jacques Toubon's wild attempts to purify his
nation's language must be alarming all serious etymologists, if a glossary
of franglais business applications provided by L'Expansion magazine is
anything to go by. Far from being a linguistic abomination, it appears
instead to be an entirely new language in the making - and certainly one in
need of translation, most of all to the Brits.
Elliptically, if your opposite number in France lets on that he is expecting
a visit from 'des gens d'Arthur' (people from Arthur), it means that
accountants Arthur Andersen are on their way. Yet more cryptically, if your
Parisian subsidiary suggests going into 'le food', far from betraying
culinary ambitions, it is telling you it intends to adopt mass-marketing
techniques. Last but not least is the 'earing', as in the sort of thing the
US congress is currently holding over Whitewater. And no, the cover date of
the magazine is not April 1.
