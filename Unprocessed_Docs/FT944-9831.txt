This month's French-language performances of Donizetti's 'La fille du
regiment' at the Teatro Regio are unusual: opera houses in Italy have always
preferred the Italian versions of works which 19th century composers like
Donizetti and Verdi wrote for Paris. Bruno Campanella conducts a staging by
Luca Ronconi, with a cast headed by Eva Mei and Giuseppe Sabbatini. Opening
night is tomorrow.
