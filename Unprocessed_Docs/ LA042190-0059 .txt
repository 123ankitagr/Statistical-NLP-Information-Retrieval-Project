Federal agents arrested a 49-year-old Venice man this week as a suspect in the holdup of 20 banks in the Los Angeles area during the last four months, the FBI reported. 
An FBI spokesman said agents arrested Edward Joseph Gibson in Venice without incident. Gibson's photograph and description had appeared in a full-page advertisement in The Times this week but his arrest was not the result of that ad, the FBI said.
