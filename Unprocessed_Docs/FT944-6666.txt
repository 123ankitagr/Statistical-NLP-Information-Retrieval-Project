North Korea has halted its nuclear programme and stopped building two
nuclear reactors in accordance with its landmark accord with the US, the
United Nations atomic safeguards agency said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Vienna. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said inspectors who
arrived in North Korea last week had visited nuclear sites in the communist
state and confirmed all work had come to a halt.
'The IAEA team visited the nuclear facilities in Yongbyon and Taechon and
confirmed that these facilities were not in operation and that construction
work had stopped,' the IAEA said in a statement.
An IAEA team held a series of negotiations with North Korean officials aimed
at setting out an inspections framework to ensure Pyongyang was complying
with a nuclear agreement signed with Washington in Geneva last month. The
statement said some verification measures, which were understood to include
inspections, had already been carried out.
North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for western
help and cash to build light-water reactors which produce less of the
plutonium that can be used to make nuclear arms. The US and its allies
suspected that North Korea had syphoned off nuclear fuel from its one
working reactor in Yongbyon to try to develop an atomic bomb.
Pressure from the west and the IAEA earlier this year provoked one of the
most serious military standoffs on the Korean peninsula since the 1950-53
Korean war. The US-North Korean accord defused the crisis.
Under the deal, the US pledged to set up an international consortium with
Japan and South Korea to help pay for the estimated Dollars 4bn operation.
