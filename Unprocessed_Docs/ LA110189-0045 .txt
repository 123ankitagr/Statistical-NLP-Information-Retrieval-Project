A song by award-winning black American singer Tracy Chapman praising jailed black leader Nelson Mandela has been banned from South African state radio and television. The South African Broadcasting Corp. said Tuesday that "Freedom Now" and another song, "Material World," were "undesirable for broadcasting." It did not elaborate. The songs may still be played by independent stations. ALEENE MacMINN
