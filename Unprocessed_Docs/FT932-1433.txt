LONG-DISTANCE road hauliers in Germany yesterday issued an angry
condemnation of the move to deregulate the European Community road haulage
market, and warned that it would unleash 'ruinous price competition'.
In a statement issued three days after the agreement reached by EC transport
ministers in Luxembourg, the German national federation of road hauliers
said much cheaper road transport charges would lead to a big switch in goods
from rail to road transport, with serious environmental consequences.
The hauliers are concerned that the agreement will lead to intense price
competition in Germany, where the market is dominated by small and
medium-sized businesses which could be undercut by larger and more efficient
European operators.
The long-distance road hauliers said that the tax burden on German operators
would almost certainly be aggravated.
The Luxembourg agreement aims at the effective deregulation of the EC road
haulage market by 1998, with any EC operator allowed to tender for business
in other member states.
In exchange, Germany, the Benelux countries and Denmark have agreed to
introduce a regional vignette (tax disc) for cross-border lorries, to help
equalise the tax burden between them.
