Original Boeing 747 Retired: The Boeing 747 that ushered in the age of the jumbo jet made its final flight before going into retirement at the Museum of Flight in Seattle. The red and white 747 rolled off Boeing's assembly line in Everett, Wash., on Sept. 30, 1968, and made its first flight Feb. 9, 1969. Since its first flight, the original 747 has served as a test plane for making refinements in the jumbo jet, including aerodynamic improvements and development of an automatic piloting system.
