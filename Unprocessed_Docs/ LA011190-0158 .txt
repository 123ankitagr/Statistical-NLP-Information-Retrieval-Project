Culver City will be applying to receive federal Community Development Block Grant funds for renovating homes, offering services to the disabled and other projects. 
City staff estimates that the city will get about $300,000 in block grant money for 1990-91. The City Council on Monday authorized applying for funds for the Neighborhood Preservation Program, which gives loans and grants to residents to remodel homes, for a program run by the Westside Fair Housing Council, and for resurfacing Fay Avenue near Jacob Street in east Culver City. 
Other projects will include paying for a coordinator of services for disabled people and for installing audible traffic signals for blind people at three intersections along Sepulveda Boulevard.
