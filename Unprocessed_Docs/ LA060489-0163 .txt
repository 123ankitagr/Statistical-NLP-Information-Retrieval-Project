On behalf of the Costa Rica National Tourist Bureau I wish to express our gratitude for Geri Massion's article on Costa Rica ("Volcano Adds Touch of Drama to Costa Rica Trip," May 21). I do, however, wish to clarify the statement: "Eco Tours, an agency of the Costa Rica Tourist Board . . . " 
The Costa Rica Tourist Board is an Institution of the Government of Costa Rica and, as such, is responsible for tourism development and promotion of the country. It is totally untrue that Eco Tours is an agency of the Tourist Board, since we do not have (such an agency) and are expressly prohibited from doing so by our government. Our responsibilities lie in dealing impartially with all wholesalers who promote the country.
