Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley will leave next week on a trip to Mexico, his fifth foreign excursion this year, it was announced Friday. 
Beginning Nov. 14, Bradley will spend five days in Mexico City, where he will meet with national and local leaders, including Mexico President Carlos Salinas de Gotari, to discuss economic development and international trade between Los Angeles and Mexico, as well as immigration and illicit drug trafficking from Central and South America. 
The mayor also plans to meet with the mayor of Mexico City, Manuel Camacho Solis, to sign an agreement on mutual assistance in case of disaster. 
Mexico City is one of Los Angeles' 17 sister cities. 
Bradley has made four previous overseas trips this year, to Saudi Arabia, the Far East, Western Europe and the Soviet Union, making him the most-traveled mayor at public expense of any of the nation's 10 largest cities.
