Actress Mimi Rogers is so busy she doesn't even know if her divorce from Tom Cruise has been finalized. 
"As far as I know, we're divorced, but I've been so busy on this new film that I haven't had time to check, so I'm not sure," she said. 
"I bet that sounds pretty silly, huh?" 
The actress put her personal life on hold while she worked in the desert from early morning to late at night on her new film "The Rapture," in which she plays a woman facing the end of the world. 
She also appears in Oliver Stone's "The Doors" and stars opposite Mickey Rourke in the thriller "Desperate Hours," which opens this weekend. 
The Michael Cimino film is a remake of the 1955 Humphrey Bogart movie "The Desperate Hours," which is about an escaped felon who takes a family hostage in their suburban home. Rogers plays the woman whose house is invaded.
