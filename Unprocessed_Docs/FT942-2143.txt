The House of Lords last night joined the Commons in agreeing that the age of
male homosexual consent should be reduced from 21 to 18, but not to 16.
In free votes on amendments to the criminal justice and public order bill
peers voted by a majority of 174 (245-71) not to lower the age to 16, and by
a majority of 63 (176-113) not to retain the age of 21 instead of 18.
Lord McIntosh of Haringey, Labour home affairs spokesman, moved the
amendment to lower the age of consent to 16.
