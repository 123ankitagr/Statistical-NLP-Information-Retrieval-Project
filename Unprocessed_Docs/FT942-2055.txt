Net revenue for the period from incorporation on January 14 1993 to the end
of March was Pounds 498,000. Earnings per share worked through at 1.93p.
The directors declared a second interim dividend of 0.9p along with a
recommended final dividend of 0.1p, making a total of 1.5p.
The C shares, issued in November 1993, raised Pounds 15.4m and at the period

The C shares were converted on May 31 1994 into 11.5m ordinary shares, which
will qualify for the second interim and final dividends.
