Ronald Reagan will return to his former job on July 11 -- describing baseball games. 
The former President will do one inning of color commentary during NBC's telecast of the All-Star game on July 11 at Anaheim Stadium, the network announced Monday. Reagan will join regular announcers Vin Scully and Tom Seaver. 
Reagan broadcast Iowa football in 1932 for WOC radio in Davenport, Iowa. One year later, he shifted to WHO, an NBC affiliate in Des Moines, Iowa, and for five seasons did re-creations of Chicago Cubs games based on written descriptions provided over Western Union wires. 
Reagan did 1 1/2 innings of color commentary last Sept. 30 during a visit to Wrigley Field. He joined announcers Harry Caray and Steve Stone.
