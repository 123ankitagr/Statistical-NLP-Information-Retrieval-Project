During my years working in chemistry and invention-processing, I used to think that technical progress in the physical sciences was both the blessing and hope of humankind. Just look at all the marvelous labor-saving and entertainment devices that research and engineering have given us! They may soon offer us round-trip service to the moon! 
No longer. I now believe that progress in the field of human behavior is much more important. Researching human behavior is far more difficult than learning to manipulate the more predictable electrons. Nevertheless, developing a greater understanding of ourselves can improve the course of civilization much more than an endless succession of slick gadgets that not everyone can afford. 
We desperately need more progress in dealing with anti-social behavior, rehabilitating criminals, motivating the apathetic, healing damaged psyches, instilling self-esteem and self-confidence, stimulating creativity, and generally fostering the attainment of human potential. 
Were it up to me, I'd slowly reduce funding for our long-running arms race (researching weaponry is in itself dehumanizing), and correspondingly increase research in human behavior and human development. 
This might not be as popular as the "Rambo" approach to problem solving, but I somehow think that the ancient prophets would smile.
