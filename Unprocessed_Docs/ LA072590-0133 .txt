Domestic Car, Truck Sales Off: Car and light-truck sales by the nation's major auto makers dropped 13% in mid-July, compared to last year when buyers flocked to showrooms to take advantage of incentives, the companies said. The sales rate during the July 11-20 period last year was among the highest of 1989. 
Incentives that drew customers into showrooms during the year-ago period were trimmed back this year. The 10 major U.S. vehicle manufacturers said they sold cars and trucks at a combined average daily rate of 34,549 during the period this year, compared to a daily average of 39,726 during the same time last year. Car sales fell 13.3%, and truck sales dropped 12.6%. GM, Ford and Chrysler said their car sales during the period fell 17.8%, while sales of cars made by Japanese companies in the United States rose 23%.
