MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries yesterday became the latest Japanese company to
announce a big cut in its workforce in response to the worsening Japanese
economy.
The company, Japan's largest heavy machinery manufacturer, said it would
reduce the number of employees at its Mihama plant in Hiroshima by about 10
per cent, or close to 400 workers, to meet an equivalent fall in demand for
products made at the plant.
Last autumn, the company sent a number of employees working at its
machine-tool plants temporarily to Mitsubishi Motors, a fellow member of the
group.
Mitsubishi Heavy said it aims to curtail its Mihama workforce over two years
through natural wastage, reduction in graduate intake, and by transferring
staff to affiliated companies.
The move highlights the spreading impact of the slowdown in Japan's economy
on the nation's workforce.
The downturn has not yet led to huge redundancies, but Japanese companies
have been encouraging older employees to retire early, transferring staff to
affiliated companies and restricting the intake of graduates.
