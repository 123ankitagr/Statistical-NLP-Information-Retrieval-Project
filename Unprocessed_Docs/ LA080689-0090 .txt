In your editorial on the Valdez oil spill, you speak of the cleanup workers "going literally from rock to rock." 
Aristotle's dictum that "art holds the mirror up to nature" is illustrated well by Lewis Carroll's conversation between the walrus and the carpenter about the beach:  "If seven maids with seven mops  Swept it for half a year,  Do you suppose," the walrus said, 
"That they could get it clear?"  "I doubt it," said the carpenter, 
and shed a bitter tear.
