Jamie Fiske, who at the age of 11 months received a liver transplant after her father made a public appeal for a donor organ, is suffering internal bleeding and was readmitted to University of Minnesota Hospital on Sunday. Doctors said they did not know the cause of the bleeding. 
Jamie, now 7, last week underwent surgery for removal of an enlarged spleen and was released from the hospital Saturday.
