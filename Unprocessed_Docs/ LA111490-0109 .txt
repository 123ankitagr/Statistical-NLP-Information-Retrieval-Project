Washington State backup quarterback Aaron Garcia has been suspended from the team for underage drinking. 
Coach Mike Price said Garcia will not play in Saturday's regular-season finale against Washington. 
Garcia, 20, from Sacramento, was arrested Saturday in Moscow, Idaho, just across the border from Pullman, where the drinking age is 21.
