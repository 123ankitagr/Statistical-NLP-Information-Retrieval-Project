The Vienna Philharmonic is giving three London concerts during the current
season, part of its 'European series' shared with Paris and Berlin. James
Levine conducted the first programme in November and Riccardo Muti will take
charge of the last in May; Georg Solti appeared with the orchestra on Monday
for a programme of Mendelssohn (the Fourth Symphony) and Shostakovich (the
Fifth).
The combination of Solti and an orchestra still able to trade on its
illustrious pedigree ensured a full, rapturous house. It was, though, an
occasion to inspire only modified rapture; artists and repertory had been
mismatched in a strangely perverse way. Applying Solti's angular
propulsiveness to a Mendelssohn symphony is the musical equivalent of
breaking a butterfly on a wheel, while the VPO's greatest admirers would not
dare to claim that it plays Shostakovich with the same distinctive flair and
style it brings to the Viennese classics or to Strauss.
Yet a genuinely great orchestra, which the Vienna patently still aspires to
be, really should have the potential to adapt its approach rather than
construe everything within its own terms of reference. It did so brilliantly
at the Proms last August when playing for Boulez, but seemed to be operating
strictly on autopilot for the Shostakovich here.
Solti, who appears to be working systematically through the canon, was
strangely restrained in the
Fifth too. One expected this conductor and these strings to
make something more of the opening paragraphs and to invest the heart of the
slow movement with sensuous depth, but no. Even the finale, launched at a
frantic pace, ran
out of steam well before the
close. It was pallid, routine, uninteresting.
Only an encore of the Fledermaus overture, whipped and driven in the Solti
way with a sort of tight-lipped humour, showed any character; by then it was
too late.
