South Korea yesterday offered a key concession to encourage North Korea to
resume international negotiations on nuclear inspections. Seoul decided to
drop a demand that the two Koreas must first exchange special envoys before
North Korea is allowed to hold another round of high-level talks with the US
on the nuclear issue.
North Korea's refusal to exchange envoys has blocked progress in achieving a
diplomatic solution to the nuclear inspection dispute. The concession is
likely to increase pressure on North Korea to accept inspections of its
nuclear sites by the International Atomic Energy Agency before an early-May
deadline. The US has offered to hold new negotiations with North Korea on
possible diplomatic recognition if Pyongyang permits the IAEA inspections.
The IAEA is likely to seek renewed contacts with North Korea next week on
full inspections, which were halted in mid-March.
