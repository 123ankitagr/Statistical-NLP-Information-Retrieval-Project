I was disgusted by the attitude displayed by Vann McElroy in the wake of the Stacey Toran tragedy. I believe that McElroy is quite mistaken: Operating a motor vehicle after drinking enough alcohol to raise one's blood-alcohol level to over three times the legal limit certainly makes one "less of a man." 
What a depressing contrast to the uplifting story of Dave Dravecky.
