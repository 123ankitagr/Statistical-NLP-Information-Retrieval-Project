After conflicting messages from Dixons and Boots last week, a clearer
picture of retailers' fortunes in the vital Christmas trading period may
emerge this week, with at least four leading groups due to make trading
statements.
Dixons rushed out a profits warning last Thursday after Christmas sales
little better than 1992. That contrasted with anecdotal evidence of brisk
trading in the final weeks before Christmas and first week of the new year
sales.
Boots, however, reported sales up 7.2 per cent, and is thought to be more
representative of the sector.
On Tuesday jewellery group Signet (formerly Ratners) and Storehouse, the
clothing group comprising BHS, Mothercare and Blazer, will report. Signet
shares were hit in December by rumours that sales were down. But at least
one analyst expects the group to announce a recovery after two years of
like-for-like (excluding new stores) decline, forecasting second-half growth
of 5-6 per cent and some margin improvement.
Storehouse is expected to follow a good Christmas last year with sales
increases of about 6 per cent at BHS and 10 per cent at Mothercare.
Body Shop, which last year reported an 8 per cent drop in like-for-like
Christmas sales, is expected to report better news on Thursday. Analysts
expect flat like-for-like sales for the second half, but growth of 4.5 per
cent including new stores.
Friday's statement from catalogue retailer Argos is also expected to be
positive. Like-for-like sales are expected to be up about 4 per cent in the
second half.
Next and Sears are still considering whether to make statements, while
Kingfisher is tipped to make its first ever Christmas statement before the
end of the month. Marks and Spencer is waiting until mid-February before
revealing its Christmas performance.
