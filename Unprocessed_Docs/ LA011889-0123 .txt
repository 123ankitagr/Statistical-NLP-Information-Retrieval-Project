Pacific Consulting Corp., a subsidiary of Newport Beach-based Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Co., was acquired for an undisclosed price by a Los Angeles subsidiary of Dun & Bradstreet Corp. 
Pacific Consulting, which administers pension funds, has become part of National Associates, the D&B unit. With 1,100 plans from Pacific Consulting, the combined firm handles nearly 6,000 pension plans, making it the biggest administrator of small pension plans in California, said John Sciarra, a National Associates spokesman. 
"This acquisition has enabled us to add market share in a very important business community, the Greater Orange County area," said Edmond H. Flynn, president of National Associates. 
The firm hired 22 of Pacific Consulting's 23 employees, including its former president, Theodore Thurston, Sciarra said. National Associates, which has an office in Mission Viejo, will move most of its operations into the Pacific Consulting office.
