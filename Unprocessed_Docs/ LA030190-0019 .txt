A Knox Elementary School teacher charged with 28 sex crimes against two 12-year-old students will go on trial June 15. 
Ernest Booker Brown, 47, who taught fourth- and fifth-graders at the Southeast San Diego school since 1986, pleaded not guilty to the charges at his arraignment Wednesday before San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez. 
Brown was arrested at the school Dec. 10, and the girls testified against him in a closed preliminary hearing two weeks ago in Municipal Court. 
The teacher is being held in County Jail in lieu of $300,000 bail.
