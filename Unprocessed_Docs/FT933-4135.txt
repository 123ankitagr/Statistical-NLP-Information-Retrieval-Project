Negotiations to resolve suspicions about North Korea's nuclear programme
reached an apparent impasse yesterday after Pyongyang rejected talks on the
issue with Seoul, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea said it would not hold discussions with South Korea until Seoul
accepted conditions it has already rejected.
The demands from Pyongyang include Seoul ending military exercises with the
US. It also says it wants South Korea to stop seeking international
co-operation on the nuclear issue, apparently to isolate Seoul from US
support.
Seoul wants to conduct mutual nuclear inspections, which the two Koreas
agreed to conduct when they signed a non-nuclear pact in late 1991.
