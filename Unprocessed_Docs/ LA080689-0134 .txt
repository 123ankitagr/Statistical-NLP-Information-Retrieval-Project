Nuclear accidents caused mainly by careless handling of radioactive materials killed 20 people and injured 1,200 in China from 1980 to 1985, an official report said. Luo Guozhen of the State Environmental Protection Bureau said China needs stricter measures for handling nuclear waste and other radioactive materials, the China Daily newspaper reported. China is building two nuclear power plants. Most of its nuclear waste so far has been generated by the military, but growing amounts are being produced in laboratories, hospitals and non-military industries.
