Schuller to Broadcast Soviet Sermon: Television evangelist Robert Schuller said Sunday he would make the first Christmas sermon ever broadcast to the Soviet people by a non-Russian clergyman. Schuller said he was notified by officials of the Soviet state television network that his address was to be broadcast Sunday evening. Schuller, who is best known for his Crystal Cathedral in Orange County, taped his Christmas message Dec. 8 during a visit to Moscow. DANIEL CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW
