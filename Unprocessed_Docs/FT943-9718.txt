Chief US delegate Robert Gallucci and Mr Kan Sok-ju, his North Korean
counterpart, resumed talks at the North Korean mission in Geneva yesterday
on Pyongyang's controversial nuclear programme, Reuter reports.
After a weekend break during which both sides were to consult with their
capitals, Mr Gallucci said it was too early to say whether there was any
policy shift from the new leadership following the death four weeks ago of
President Kim Il-sung.
The US and its allies in east Asia are trying to persuade North Korea, which
they accuse of having a secret nuclear weapons programme, to open up its
nuclear power facilities to full international inspection.
The most immediate issue in this round of talks is the fate of about 8,000
spent fuel rods taken from a reactor at Yongbyon in June.
The US which originally threatened United Nations sanctions over the fuel
rods, has warned that they could soon corrode and pose a radiation risk.
