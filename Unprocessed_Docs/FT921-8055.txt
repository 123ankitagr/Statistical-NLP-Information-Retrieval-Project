One by-product of the collapse of Australia's famous entrepreneurs is that
Australian banks are now world experts at disposing of seized collateral.
However, Westpac Banking Corporation is maintaining a discreet silence about
its latest asset - Kalgoorlie's Pink House brothel in the heart of Western
Australia's goldfields.
Westpac took possession of the property after Madame Cherie failed to keep
up mortgage payments on the 14-bedroom house, which also boasts a spa,
swimming pool, and various 'entertainment areas'. The brothel operates
legally under the Western Australian state government's vice-containment
policy.
But there is no prospect of a Westpac-sponsored executive relief centre.
According to the fine print, corporations are barred from running brothels;
these can only be operated by women acting without financial backing from
men.
