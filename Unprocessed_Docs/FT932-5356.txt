TAIWAN'S economics ministry may ease restrictions on capital flows as part
of the island's financial liberalisation, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The ministry is considering a proposal to allow Taiwanese companies to send
investment funds of more than Dollars 5m (Pounds 3.2m) out of the country
without approval. Remittances totalling less than Dollars 5m a year can
already be made freely.
Companies would still need central bank approval for the outward flows, and
the ministry would continue to screen all Taiwanese investments in China
because Taipei wanted to prevent excessive capital movements, the spokesman
said.
He said the ministry was also considering proposals to relax restrictions on
foreign investment in Taiwan.
