A NEW bout of transatlantic fare wars loomed yesterday as American Airlines,
one of the three largest US carriers, said it would match the fare cuts on
European routes initiated by its smaller rival, Continental Airlines, on
Monday.
Continental, which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection
since late 1990, announced that it was reducing fares for winter travel in
Europe by an average of 35 per cent.
The reduced-price tickets apply to travel between December 27 and March 30,
and must be purchased by December 31.
Continental's move cuts round trip fares from Dollars 498-Dollars 902, to
Dollars 358-Dollars 498. The cheaper tickets would be non-refundable.
American's response is significant because it is a bigger transatlantic
operator than Continental and is likely to spur similar reductions from
other big carriers.
This latest bout of price-cutting comes just as the US airline industry is
reporting dismal figures for the third quarter of 1992.
