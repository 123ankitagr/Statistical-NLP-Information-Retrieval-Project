The spirit of Benjamin Britten remains the presiding genius at the Aldeburgh
Festival, which begins on Friday, This year's programme pairs Britten with
Stravinsky, contemporaries and complimentary composers who shared some
musical interests, but set out to explore very different personal issues.
Both wrote fine medium-scale works for which the intimate atmosphere of the
Maltings at Snape is best suited.  A handful of premieres and some
interesteing recitals are other highlights of the festival, which runs until
June 26.
