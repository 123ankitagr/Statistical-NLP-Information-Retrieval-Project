Police have arrested a top company official in the biggest corruption case
in the history of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Mr Zhu Jianping, 48, deputy
general manager of Shanghai Rubber Belt, allegedly earned Yn800,000 (Pounds
60,000) by selling shares in his own company. The announcement of his arrest
adds to the woes of a market tarnished by speculation and battered by a wave
of selling in the past several months. 'He's nothing more than a worm in the
reform process,' one prosecutor said.
