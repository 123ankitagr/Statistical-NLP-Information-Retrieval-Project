Volunteers are needed to help string lights on Christmas Tree Lane, Town Councilman Gene Coffman said Tuesday. Those interested in volunteering to string lights from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturday and Dec. 8 may call the Altadena Chamber of Commerce at (818) 794-3988, or simply show up. A party to celebrate the opening of the lane this season will be held under the deodar trees at 6 p.m. Dec. 14.
