GE Says PCBs Break Down Naturally: General Electric Co. released a report that it says shows the natural biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls in New York's Hudson River. 
The company had dumped PCBs in the river for about 25 years, when the practice was legal and before the substances were suspected of harming human health. Recently, the state has proposed dredging the river to remove the contaminated material to a landfill. GE said its results match those of a 1984 New York Department of Environmental Conservation report, but it couldn't say whether the natural process would rid the river of all PCBs.
