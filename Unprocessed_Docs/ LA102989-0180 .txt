Pacific Bell proposed a $135-million rate reduction, which if approved would save the average California customer 35 cents a month. The reduction is part of a recently approved system that allows Pacific Bell and GTE, the two largest phone companies in the state, to have more control over rates. The Public Utilities Commission will review the company's application by the end of the year.
