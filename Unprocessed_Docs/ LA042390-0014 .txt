"We need a total war," wrote Nixon (Op-Ed Page, April 12). "Total war means war on all fronts against an enemy with many faces." 
Did he write these words 40 years ago, when communism was the enemy? No, he wrote them within the last year or so, to call for a remorseless struggle against drugs. 
Since Nixon knows a good deal about China, perhaps he remembers what "total war against drugs" meant in that country, after Chairman Mao took over in 1949. It meant that dope dealers were summarily executed. Users were hauled off to "re-education camps," where they faced the tender mercies of merciless cadres who were both militant and puritanical. It worked; China was made free of drugs. But it also was made free of a great many other valuable things, such as personal liberty. 
How, then, can we fight drugs? I don't know. I don't think anyone knows. It's not a problem like sending men to the moon, where if you do certain technical things correctly, you will succeed. But I do know that it is much easier to snuff out liberty in a country than to snuff out drug use. When Nixon condemns his adversaries for "intellectual arrogance," perhaps he should look in the mirror.
