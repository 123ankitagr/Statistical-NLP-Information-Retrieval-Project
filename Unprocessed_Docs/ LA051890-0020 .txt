Q: I'm 5-foot-10 and wear a Size 10 medium shoe. What style shoes should I wear with my strapless white taffeta prom dress? My date is also 5-foot-10, and I don't want to tower over him. 
The dress has a fitted bodice and long, full skirt. I plan to wear it with a white lace shawl. -- L.M. 
A: How about dancing the night away in ballet slippers? They're fashionable, comfortable and will make your date feel 10 feet tall -- well, almost. Those illustrated here are a new, improved version of the classic dance shoe. By Paul Mayer, they are designed with a ruffled top line to simulate the look of drawstrings and/or elasticizing. 
The shoes are available in white leather, bronze and gold metallic leather, black suede and black patent for $86.95. Any of the first three would look ideal with your dress. The shoes come in Sizes 5-10 medium at Nordstrom's San Francisco Center, 855 Market St., San Francisco, Calif. 94103. If you haven't already purchased the white lace shawl, how about giving the white a lift by wearing a gold shawl with gold ballet slippers?
