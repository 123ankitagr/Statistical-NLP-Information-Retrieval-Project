Perhaps it should be called 'The Beautiful and the Dammed'. According to
vibes emanating from Los Angeles, narcissistic pop-star Michael Jackson is
to join disgraced junk bond financier Michael Milken in a new cable TV
network which will seemingly focus on 'education and entertainment'.

sentence after pleading guilty to six counts of securities fraud. But he has
yet to perform 1,800 hours of community service in each of the next three
years.
