ense men Dave Manson of the Chicago Blackhawks and Scott Stevens of the Washington Capitals were suspended for three games by the NHL today for biting and scratching during a fight in a Feb. 27 game. 
Manson, who was suspended for 13 games earlier this season, was also fined $500, NHL Vice President Brian O'Neill said. 
"The videotape offers no assistance in identifying which of the two players acted first," O'Neill said. "Both claim the other was responsible." 
Stevens accused Manson of biting him while Manson claimed he was gouged during the fight. Stevens was given a match penalty while Manson received a gross misconduct and match penalty.
