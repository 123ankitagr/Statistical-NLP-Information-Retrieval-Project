Electro Rent Corp. said its fiscal first-quarter net income fell 22% from a year earlier, to $1.7 million from $2.2 million, and its sales dropped to $26.7 million from $29.4 million. 
Van Nuys-based Electro Rent attributed the lower results to a decrease in sales of used electronic test equipment. 
The company rents, leases and sells such electronic equipment, primarily to aerospace companies.
