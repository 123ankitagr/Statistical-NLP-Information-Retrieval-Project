New Zealand's prime minister, Mr Jim Bolger, yesterday welcomed a US
decision to upgrade military and official contacts with Wellington.
Relations were restricted in 1987 when New Zealand passed a law prohibiting
visits by nuclear powered or armed vessels.
Mr Bolger said the policy shift would enable New Zealand to have the kind of
dialogue 'commensurate with our shared interests and values on both
bilateral and broader strategic issues'.
In a weekend statement, the US State Department emphasised that the Clinton
administration had decided to resume senior level contacts, but this did not
mean a restoration of US defence relationships with New Zealand or the
revitalisation of the ANZUS pact, which formerly linked Australia, New
Zealand and the US.
The statement said the US would continue to press for a change in New
Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation. However, the State Department now
recognised that 'our two countries had important business to conduct outside
the area of defence relations. . . To advance that goal, we have decided to
restore senior level contacts with New Zealand on political, strategic and
broad security matters,' it said.
Asked whether the government would now consider amending legislation to
allow American or British nuclear warships to visit, Mr Bolger said there
was no proposal to review the law. 'I would caution against seeing the thaw
as a full restoration of ANZUS.'
President Clinton had undertaken to review the relationship at a meeting
with Mr Bolger at Seattle in December.
