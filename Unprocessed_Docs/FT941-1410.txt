Employers were yesterday urged by the government not to state age limits in
job advertisements and take other positive measures to end discrimination
against older workers.
Miss Ann Widdecombe, the employment minister, launching a campaign against
ageism in the workplace, said 40 per cent of employers admitted
discriminating on age grounds.
She said age bars could be as low as 30 and some employers had refused to
promote or train older workers, selecting the oldest first for redundancy.
More than 5,000 copies of a booklet called Getting On will be sent to
Jobcentres and large employers.
Miss Widdecombe said: 'If the way to employers' hearts is through
productivity or profit margins, they should all be in love with the idea of
an older workforce. They are as adaptable as their younger counterparts and
their commitment and loyalty is often greater.'
Miss Widdecombe said she had looked at anti-ageism measures in other
countries including the US, where it is illegal to use age limits in
advertisements. But she said such measures had not been effective and she
did not want to put additional burdens on employers.
