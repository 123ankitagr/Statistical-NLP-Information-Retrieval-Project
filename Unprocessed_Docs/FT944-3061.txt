More use should be made of the River Thames for tourists, commuters and
commercial users, the River Thames Working Group, chaired by transport
minister Mr Steven Norris, said yesterday.
It called for better promotion and co-ordination of tourist passenger
services and other leisure amenities on the river, a review of the location
of piers and further promotion of opportunities to develop bulk cargoes on
the river through the freight facilities grant scheme.
