Texas Air Jet Order Anticipated: Texas Air Corp. is expected to unveil an order for Airbus Industrie wide-body jetliners worth about $2 billion, industry analysts said. "Texas Air is looking for wide-body aircraft and Airbus Industrie is looking for customers -- it's not surprising that there should be a friendship," said Paul Karos at First Boston Corp. Airbus is a consortium of European companies. Texas Air and Airbus officials declined comment on what would be discussed at a joint news conference scheduled for today in New York.
