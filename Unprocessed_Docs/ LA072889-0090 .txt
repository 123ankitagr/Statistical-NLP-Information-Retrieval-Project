The beleaguered tanker Exxon Valdez will probably be towed into San Diego Bay for repairs on Sunday after tests are made to determine whether the ship is leaking any more significant amounts of oily discharges. The Exxon Shipping Co. and the state of California have agreed that the ship cannot leak any more before entering the harbor, but the state has said it will be "reasonable" about leakage and the Coast Guard has said it will permit any discharge that can be contained by cleanup equipment surrounding the ship. Oily discharges have come sporadically from the ship's hull since it was towed here from Alaska after a collision with a reef that dumped 11 million gallons of oil along a once pristine shoreline.
