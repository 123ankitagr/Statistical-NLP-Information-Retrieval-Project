SG Warburg has maintained its investment rating in spite of issuing a profit
warning earlier this week. Standard & Poors, the US rating agency, has
assigned its A+ rating to SGW Finance's Dollars 250m guaranteed
floating-rate notes due in 1998. The UK investment bank won the renewed
grading even after this week's profits announcement.
S&P's judgment allows Warburg to maintain its claim to be the only UK house
with a rating to match those of the most strongly capitalised US investment
banks.
