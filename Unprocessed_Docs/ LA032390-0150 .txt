Aliso Creek Road, a new street linking El Toro Road with Alicia Parkway in Laguna Niguel, is open. 
Two lanes of the 4 1/2-mile-long road that winds through Laguna Niguel and Aliso Viejo were opened last week, said Tom Mathews, a spokesman for County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley said. An expansion of the road to include additional lanes will be completed in May, Mathews said. 
Aliso Creek Road is being built at a cost of $13.3 million under a development agreement between the county and the Mission Viejo Co. The road is part of the $120-million Aliso Viejo Development Agreement approved by the Board of Supervisors in 1987.
