Costa Rica's ruling National Liberation Party nominated conservative economist Carlos Manuel Castillo, 60, as its presidential candidate for next year's election. With only 12% of the votes counted, engineer Roland Araya conceded defeat to Castillo, who was leading with 65% of the ballots. An estimated 350,000 members of the party voted. President Oscar Arias Sanchez was not permitted to support either candidate, and the constitution prohibits him from running for reelection. Castillo will face Rafael Angel Calderon Fournier, who won the nomination of the opposition Social Christian Unity Party last November. Elections are scheduled for next Feb. 4.
