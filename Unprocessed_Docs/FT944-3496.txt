Sir, Is democracy really the winner, as is stated by William Bakewell
(Letters, December 9) in response to the government's defeat over an
increase in VAT on domestic fuel?
Perhaps it is when one considers that the majority of the electorate would
not seem to support the move.
However, as far as parliamentary democracy is concerned can we be so sure?
Did every member of all the opposition parties vote according to their
conscience, or did they vote politically to bring about a humiliating defeat
on the government?
Equally, did all the unrebellious Conservatives vote with the government for
the former reason or were they simply trying to prevent such a humiliation?
If political motives did indeed determine how MPs voted, then democracy has
not been served.
The outcome in reality acts merely as an example of how enormous political
power can be wielded by small minority groups or parties whatever electoral
system is prevalent when governments rule through coalition or small
minorities.
