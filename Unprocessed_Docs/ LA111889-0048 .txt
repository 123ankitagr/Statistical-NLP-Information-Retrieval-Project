Newport Harbor High School's defensive line held fast on Glenn's two-point conversion rushing attempt to preserve a 21-20 overtime victory in the first round of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs at La Mirada High School Friday night. 
After Glenn's two-point conversion pass from Hector Valdez to Travis Carter was nullified by offsetting penalties, Valdez handed off to Jerry Jonnadal who was tackled by a swarm of defenders a yard short of the goal line. 
Newport (9-2) won the coin toss after the regulation ended in a 14 -- 14 tie. Under California tiebreaker rules, the Sailors had four chances to score from the Eagle 10. On their last play, quarterback Stephen Scheck hit tight end George Greenwalt from the 2. Josh Klein's kick gave Newport Harbor a 21-14 lead. 
Glenn had four chances from the 10 and Valdez hit Robert Ernster in the end zone from the seven on its second play. Valdez's swing pass to Carter appeared to give the game to the Eagles until the offsetting penalties.
