A Los Angeles police officer today testified that "Cheers" star Kelsey Grammer confessed to dropping a small packet of cocaine in his patrol car after the actor was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving in 1988. 
"That cocaine was in my pocket. 
I felt stupid. I should have just told you I had it," Officer Michael Akana quoted Grammer as saying. "You deserve better than that. I would like to apologize to you," the star allegedly added. 
Akana was the sole witness during a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court on the cocaine possession charge stemming from Grammer's 1988 arrest in North Hollywood. 
Judge Aviva K. Bobb said the evidence was sufficient to hold Grammer for trial and scheduled a Van Nuys Superior Court arraignment for June 13. 
Wearing a blue jail uniform and sporting a stubbly beard, Grammer looked cheerful as he came into court. He is serving a 30-day sentence for a probation violation stemming from an unrelated drunk driving conviction.
