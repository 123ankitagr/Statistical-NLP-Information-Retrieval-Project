It's First Advance, making her first turf start, retook the lead from favored Lem's Peace in the final strides to win Friday's $41,000 allowance feature by a head at Santa Anita. 
Jockey Laffit Pincay sent It's First Advance to the front from the start in the mile race for 3-year-old fillies and opened a two-length lead coming off the clubhouse turn. Lem's Peace, ridden by Robbie Davis, closed the gap at the top of the stretch and took a brief lead in mid-stretch. 
But It's First Advance, carrying high weight of 117 pounds, regained the lead and finished in 1:38 1/5. Twain Harte, with Eddie Delahoussaye aboard, finished third, another two lengths back.
