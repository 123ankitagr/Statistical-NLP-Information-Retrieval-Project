MOST WORKERS start drawing pension benefits well before they reach their
official retirement ages of 60 or 65, a survey of leading UK pension schemes
shows.
The survey, by Incomes Data Services, the pay analysts, found that more than
eight out of 10 employees retired before reaching the 'normal' pension age
as defined by their scheme rules. Two-thirds of recently retiring members
went before the age of 60.
The findings have significance for the government's policy on state pensions
because it is considering raising the age at which women may start receiving
state pensions from 60 to 65.
The survey noted that for schemes which allowed men to retire at 60 there
was a higher degree of 'late' retirement since men had an incentive to keep
working until their state pensions became available for income as well.
The analysis covered 32,000 individual retirements in 15 large occupational
schemes including Barclays Bank, the occupational fund for teachers, British
Petroleum and Unilever. Six schemes were for large private-sector employers
and eight for smaller employers.
IDS said: 'The analysis found that the term 'normal pension age' is
increasingly a misnomer, with few members waiting until the age of 60 or 65
to draw pensions.'
The survey also found that late retirement - retirement after normal pension
age - was relatively insignificant.
The survey found that in four of the schemes more than 40 per cent of
retirements took place before the member reached the age of 55, with 59.6
per cent of Barclay's members retiring before that time.
