Sen. Eduardo Menem, brother of Argentine President Carlos Saul Menem, has become the effective leader of the ruling Justicialist (Peronist) Party after becoming its vice president Friday night, party sources said Saturday. 
Although Carlos Saul Menem was chosen party president by the national council, he accepted the position in name only, saying he cannot take a leading role in internal party affairs while being president of the nation. 
Antonio Cafiero stepped down last Tuesday as party president.
