A Silver Spring, Md., man who received what was believed to be the nation's first successful heart-pancreas transplant, could be out of the hospital in a few weeks, hospital officials said Sunday. 
Barry Katz, 45, a senior scientist for the Strategic Defense Initiative program, was a diabetic whose heart had been severely damaged by the disease. Doctors said they decided that because of Katz's condition, complications would result if only his heart were replaced. 
Hospital officials said Katz was within days of death.
