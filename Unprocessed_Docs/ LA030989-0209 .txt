Johnny Carson, who has hosted "The Tonight Show" for 26 years, will be back for at least another season after this one. 
"The other day I was having lunch with Mr. Brandon Tartikoff, the president of NBC Entertainment and part-time actor," Carson said during the taping of Wednesday night's show. "We talked as we do about this time every year. He said 'What are your plans?' I said, 'Maybe we should do another year.' So we signed it and we're going to continue for another year from September." 
"The Tonight Show" was rated No. 1 among late-night shows during the latest Nielsen ratings period last month.
