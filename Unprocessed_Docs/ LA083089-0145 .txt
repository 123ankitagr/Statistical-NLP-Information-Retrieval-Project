Clemson tailback Terry Allen, who could become the school's all-time leading rusher this season, was charged with driving under the influence and jailed for five hours before being released on bond, authorities said. 
South Carolina Highway Patrol Officer Robert E. Gambrell stopped Allen, 21, early Sunday morning on suspicion of driving under the influence, according to a booking report and confinement record, said Officer Jerry Zimmerman, assistant supervisor at the Oconee County Law Enforcement Center. 
Allen was released on a personal recognizance bond after appearing before Magistrate Judge Larry Butts, Zimmerman said. A court date was tentatively set for Sept. 12, a highway patrol supervisor said.
