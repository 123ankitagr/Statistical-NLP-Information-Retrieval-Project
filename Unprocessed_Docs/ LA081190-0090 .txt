President Bush, praising the personal efforts of Marilyn Quayle to promote early detection of cancer, signed legislation Friday to assist in providing breast and cervical cancer screening to mainly low-income women. 
It was the first public appearance for Vice President Dan Quayle's wife since she underwent a hysterectomy on July 28 after cancer cells were detected in a cervical Pap smear. 
Bush said that Mrs. Quayle had brought "a wonderful, sincere element to this cause." 
The bill the President signed provides grants to states to screen women for breast and cervical cancer, using mammograms, Pap smears and physical examination.
