"THE CONDUCTOR"(France-Belgium, 1989; Director: Marion Hansel. Century Plaza 2, 7 p.m.) Exquisitely wrought meditation on the nature of identity, involving guilt and responsibility, with a classical music background. The acting is wonderful: including Malcolm McDowell's best performance in years. As in many international co-productions, though, the mix of nationalities may unsettle some audiences. (Kevin Thomas).
