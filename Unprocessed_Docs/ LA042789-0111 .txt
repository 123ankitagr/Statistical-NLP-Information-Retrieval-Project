Leaders of the International Olympic Committee voted to allow pro tennis players to continue in the Games, a reinforcement after pro eligibility was granted on an experimental basis in 1988. 
Also in the meeting at Barcelona, Spain, Primo Nebiolo, who is being investigated in an Italian business scandal, failed to win reelection as president of the group of summer Olympic sports organizations, even though he was unopposed. 
Delegates to the annual meeting of the Assn. of Summer Olympic International Federations, concerned with Nebiolo's tarnished image, voted to postpone the election until a meeting in October. Nebiolo heads track and field's international governing body.
