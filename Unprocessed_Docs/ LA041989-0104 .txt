Paul F. Crouch, founder and president of Tustin-based Trinity Broadcasting Network, was among 16 evangelical leaders who met with President Bush on Tuesday. The religious leaders requested the meeting because of what one called a "crisis of confidence" following Bush's statements last month indicating he opposes tuition tax credits for parents of private school students. Bush assured them he still favors the tax credits, adding, however, that because of budget restraints he is unable to push for them now, the White House said. In addition to tax credits, the evangelicals and Bush also discussed their mutual opposition to abortion.
