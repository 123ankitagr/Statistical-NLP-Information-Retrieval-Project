The federal government has agreed to shoulder a greater-than-normal share of the financial burden for damage caused by Hurricane Hugo in South Carolina, the White House announced Friday. 
The federal government will pay 75% of all eligible costs up to $34 million, and above that amount it will pay all costs.
