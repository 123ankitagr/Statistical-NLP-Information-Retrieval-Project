We've been saying for years that Mott the Hoople is the great unsung band of the '70s. So imagine our delight to hear that Mott mainstays Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson are back together. The duo has a new album, "Y U I Orta," due out Oct. 3 from PolyGram, with an eight-week U.S. tour slated to begin in mid-October. You can also hear Hunter (who wrote Great White's current hit "Once Bitten Twice Shy") on Mick Jones' new solo album, which has a song, "Just Wanna Hold," co-written by Jones and another Mick -- Mick Jagger. . . . The new issue of RIP Magazine features an interview with Ozzy Osbourne, saying how hard it's been for him to conquer his booze addiction. ("Now I've got my own therapy," he explained. "And I'm back on the mend again.") Unfortunately, Ozzy was being too optimistic -- he's back in detox after falling off the wagon again. . . . With Mick Jagger and Co. on tour, it's somehow fitting that a young South Bay band called Eggplant has penned a song called "Rolling Stones" (which leads off the group's debut "Monkeybars" album). Actually, it's unclear whether the song is about the Stones or a group of interplanetary rockers posing as the Stones. Sample lyrics: "They spent four hours every night just messing up their hair so it would look like they didn't care. . . . they had their pick of the hottest girls on earth, who nine months after they left gave birth, they cared more about undressing the girls than leaving a forwarding address . . . they sounded like the Rolling Stones, meet the Rolling Stones."
