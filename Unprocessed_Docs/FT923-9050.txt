ZIMBABWE'S government, which recently passed a controversial law to take
land from white farmers for black peasants, has appealed to white farmers to
stay in the country, reports Reuter from Harare.
Industry officials say hundreds of white farmers, angered by the new law,
plan to emigrate to neighbouring countries, especially Zambia and
Mozambique.
'Those who are calling for a latter-day 'great trek' to the north and east
of our borders are over-reacting and misleading others,' said the country's
vice-president Mr Simon Muzenda. 'There is enough land in our country for
Zimbabweans who genuinely want to make a living from it,' he said when he
opened an annual meeting of the white Commercial Farmers Union.
White commercial farmers occupy about 70 per cent of the country's most
fertile land.
