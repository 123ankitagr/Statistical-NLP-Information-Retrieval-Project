The City Council has approved hiring a Pasadena engineering firm to study how to remove excessive iron and manganese from a municipal water well. 
James M. Montgomery Engineers Inc. has been awarded a $20,000 contract to figure out how to treat the well, which the city built last year but never operated because the chemicals exceeded state health limits. 
The study will also determine how much it will cost to remove the contaminants, Public Works Director Joseph Y. Wang said. 
Six other wells provide more than enough water for the city, Wang said.
