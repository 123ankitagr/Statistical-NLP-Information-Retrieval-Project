John Westhead, chief executive of Bowthorpe, has rejoined the board of
Southern Water as a non-executive director after an absence of fifteen
months.
The board of Bowthorpe had suggested, when Westhead was promoted from group
managing director to chief executive at the beginning of 1992, that he
should relinquish other commitments. Now that he has settled into that role,
however, his fellow directors felt that the Southern position would bring
'useful cross-fertilisation', said Martyn Webster, group managing director
of Southern.
'I was upset when he first had to go. He is a very good non-executive
director at the sharp end of British industry who commands quite a high
reputation in the City.'
Non-executive director Sir David Nicolson, having turned 70, stepped down
from the Southern board in March.
