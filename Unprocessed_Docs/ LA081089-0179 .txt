Flying Tiger Pilots Union Upheld: The National Mediation Board rejected a bid by Federal Express to decertify the union that represents 933 former Flying Tiger Line pilots. The board did decertify Flying Tiger's machinists' union, however. Federal Express acquired Los Angeles-based Tiger International, the parent of Flying Tiger Line, last December. Federal Express' 1,064 pilots aren't members of any union. A spokesman for Memphis, Tenn.-based Federal Express said the ruling means that the Air Line Pilots Assn. may continue to represent ex-Tiger pilots until pilots from Federal Express and Flying Tiger jointly vote on union representation this fall.
