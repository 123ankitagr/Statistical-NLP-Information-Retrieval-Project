Fordham is the VH-1 generation's latest politically correct but innocuous torch singer. 
(Her superfluous nod to the rain forests in the middle of a romantic ballad here is as much a non sequitur as last year's apartheid reference.) The sentimental writing on this sophomore effort is not without intelligent touches, yet the once-shunned, now-hep easy-listening approach virtually defies you to pay attention. "You treat my skin like porcelain," Fordham complains in the quietly weepy title song, but the woman doth protest too much: "Porcelain," the album, lives up to its title -- untouchably pretty and dull.
