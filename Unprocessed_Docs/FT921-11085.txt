Sir, In view of the correspondence about the importance of using the
Japanese language to do business successfully in Japan which has appeared in
your columns (Letters, January 15, 21 and 27), two points may be worth
noting.
First, in research recently undertaken by Gallup in Japan into Japanese
corporate buyer attitudes, the majority of respondents believed that 'it is
important for businessmen from abroad to have the ability to conduct
business in the Japanese language'.
Second, Priority Japan, the industry-to-industry campaign which follows on
from the Opportunity Japan Campaign, is actively trying to spread the word
among British companies about the need to do business in Japanese and to
take advantage of the various schemes to train their personnel in the
language.
This is not to contradict senior industrialists quoted by Mr Alan Tomlinson
(January 27) as preferring Japanese staff for their Japanese operations.
On the contrary British industry needs to invest both in a presence in
Japan, staffed by Japanese and/or non-Japanese nationals, and in a greater
awareness and knowledge of things Japanese at home.
