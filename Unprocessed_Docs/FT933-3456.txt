LatInvest, an investment bank set up last year to concentrate on Latin
American equities and corporate finance, has recruited Paul Davies, formerly
senior manager responsible for management accounting at Nomura
International, as its finance director. Victor Galliano, from Barings'
Spanish team, has also joined the boutique's Mexican research team.
Meanwhile, Per-Arne Johansson, one of LatInvest's four founder shareholders,
is moving to New York, joining a small team already there, to expand the US
clientele.
