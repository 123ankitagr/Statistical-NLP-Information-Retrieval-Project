President Bill Clinton yesterday offered North Korea the prospect of talks
on 'a thorough, broad approach to the issues that divide us', but insisted
the US was not relaxing its demands nor making any concessions.
'If it abandons its nuclear option and honours its international
non-proliferation commitments, the door will be open on a wide range of
issues. . .' Mr Clinton said after meeting President Kim Young-sam of South
Korea at the White House.
'If it does not, it risks the increased opposition of the entire
international community.'
Mr Clinton reaffirmed the US' 'unyielding commitment to South Korea's
security', but said the US and South Korea were willing to re-examine their
policies if North Korea was willing to allow inspectors from the
International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor its nuclear programme.
Both Mr Clinton and Mr Kim appeared to be anxious to play down suggestions
they were offering Pyongyang a 'package deal', offering specific short-term
concessions, such as the cancellation of this year's Team Spirit joint
US-South Korean military exercise, if North Korea complied with their
immediate demands, and holding out longer-term economic and diplomatic gains
in exchange for continued co-operation.
Both Washington and Seoul agree that UN sanctions against North Korea would
not be 'a particularly attractive option'.
Foreign policy experts outside the Clinton administration acknowledge the
need to negotiate with North Korea, if only to build support among other
countries for tougher measures should the need arise.
They warn, however, about the danger of making concessions just to persuade
North Korea to remain a member of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
while doing nothing about suspect sites believed to be part of a secret
nuclear programme.
