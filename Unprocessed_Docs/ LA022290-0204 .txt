Raise Your Voices: "Lift Up Every Voice and Sing" is the name of the song Melba Moore calls the "new black national anthem." Moore put Bobby Brown, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Dionne Warwick, Anita Baker, BeBe and CeCe Winans and Stevie Wonder together to tape a video for the song, which will be released on Capitol on April 4. The proceeds will go to the NAACP, the United Negro College Fund and sickle cell anemia research. BETH KLEID
