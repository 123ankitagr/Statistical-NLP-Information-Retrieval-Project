A Russian Ilyushin IL-76 military transport aircraft burns outside Kabul
yesterday, after rebels ignored a temporary ceasefire and fired a salvo of
rockets into the airport. The aircraft had been sent to evacuate Russian
diplomats and their families from the besieged capital. Four Russian
commandos who were aboard the aircraft were injured escaping from the blaze.
