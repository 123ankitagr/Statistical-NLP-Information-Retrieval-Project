TEA
There was good general demand, reports the Tea Brokers' Association. Landed
assams met improved competition but mostly at lower levels although plain
descriptions came to a firm market. Brightest liquoring East Africans were
again a strong feature particularly pekoe dusts. Medium and plainer sorts
remained about steady. Ceylons were well supported at firm to dearer rates.
Offshore less demand with prices tending easier. The highest price realised
this week was 211p for an assam gbop.
