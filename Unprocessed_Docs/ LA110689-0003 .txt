Your article on Katz's trip down the Los Angeles River in a Chevy Blazer made me realize something. 
He's right about using the river for the commuting. But he's wrong about the vehicle. 
The river should have dams and locks so commuter boats (like the tour boats on Holland's canals) can shuttle people back and forth to Los Angeles.
