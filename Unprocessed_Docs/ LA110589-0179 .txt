Scientists are certain that a major earthquake will hit Southern California sometime in the future, but they do not know precisely when or where it will strike. A Times Special Report, "Waiting for the Quake," provides a detailed look at the earthquake faults that criss-cross the Los Angeles area and examines two leading scenarios for a big quake. It also shows which freeways and key buildings are vulnerable, and tells how residents can prepare for the Big One. See Section Q.
