FOREIGN investment in Taiwan's industries fell 61 per cent to USDollars 132m
(Pounds 77m) in the first two months of the year from the same period last
year, while Taiwanese investment abroad dropped by 66 per cent to Dollars
229m (Pounds 133m).
Japan was once more the biggest investor, according to figures published
yesterday by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. More than Dollars 56m of
funds for investment into Taiwanese industry were approved in January and
February. The second largest was Europe, with Dollars 25m.
Rising operating costs on the island have taken their toll on inward
investment, and the world recession has affected both inward and outward
investment, according to economists,
Foreign investment interest centred on trade and the electronics industry.
However, foreign investment in electronics fell nearly 80 per cent from last
February, and investment in the plastics sector increased more than 10-fold.
Analysts say, however, that these statistics are based on applications
approved, not on funds actually entering the country, and that duplicate
applications by foreign companies in several countries in the region can
lead to over-estimation of foreign investment.
Although Taiwanese investment abroad decreased overall, funds approved for
investment in the US were up by nearly 40 per cent on the same period last
year, to Dollars 44m, 19 per cent of all outward investment approved from
January to February.
Officials say the outward investment figures measure only investments made
through official channels. Many companies making smaller investments
overseas often do so without registering with the government.
Taiwanese investment in China is increasing, bringing with it the fear of
over-dependence on mainland markets. Taiwanese companies invested Dollars
1.5bn in Fukien province alone in 1991, and Dollars 15.6m in southern China
in January and February, Dollars 11m of which was in metals, electronics and
plastics.
