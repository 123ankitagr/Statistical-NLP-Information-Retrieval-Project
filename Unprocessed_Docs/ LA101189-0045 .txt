Ugandan authorities have released a U.N. relief plane, its two American pilots, two British passengers and three Kenyan crew members nearly three weeks after they were detained following an emergency landing in Uganda, officials said. Tarcis Kabwegyere, minister of state for foreign affairs, said the seven aboard and the aircraft, released Friday, are expected to leave for Nairobi today. The plane made an emergency landing Sept. 22 in Kaabong, in northeastern Uganda, after running out of fuel in bad weather. It was trying to return to Lokichoggio, Kenya, after delivering emergency food and other supplies to southern Sudan.
