As one who suffers from Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (now called Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome), I very much appreciated the two recent episodes of NBC's "The Golden Girls" that dealt with this baffling and debilitating ailment. The shows did not exaggerate the enormous frustration of trudging from doctor to doctor only to be told, "It's all in your head," or dismissed altogether.
