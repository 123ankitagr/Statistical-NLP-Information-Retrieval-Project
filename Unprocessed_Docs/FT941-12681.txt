European commodity trade is being threatened by uncertainty over new rules
on value added tax, according to the Simkins Partnership, a legal group
respresenting traders.
The European Commission is being urged by UK Customs and commodity exchanges
and traders to simplify complex VAT rules and clarify their application to
transactions in oil, metals, grains and soft commodities such as cocoa.
Ms Ann Humphrey, a VAT consultant to Simkins said: 'It is essential that the
confusion and uncertainty in this market caused by the new rules is removed
quickly and in a way which results in the minimum disruption to trade.'
The confusion has arisen over rules introduced at the beginning of last
year. Under the single market regulations, any sale of goods between
registered traders in different member countries does not involve payment of
VAT as long as those goods leave one European Union country and are
delivered to another.
Commodity transactions, however, can involve the sale and re-sale of the
same commodity numerous times, from several different EU countries, without
physical delivery. This means the sale is theoretically liable to different
or multiple VAT levies.
Member countries are also implementing the rules in different ways,
increasing the confusion for traders.
The problem tends to be more pressing in the UK than in the rest of the EU
as London is an important centre for the commodity trade. UK Customs has
been calling on the Commission to take action for the past year and
submitted its proposals to officials last July.
Ms Humphrey said, however, that the Commission had not regarded the issue as
a priority. The Confederation of British Industry has now taken up the issue
with the Commission. The Commission expects to present its proposals in the
next couple of weeks.
