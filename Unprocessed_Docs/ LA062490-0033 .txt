I found Patrick Goldstein's piece "Farrell Is Addicted to Not Covering Up His Covers" (June 10) extremely disturbing. I cannot believe what is happening concerning censorship. 
I was outraged when I went into a record shop a few years ago in search of Poison's "Open Up and Say Ahh" and instead of finding the original album cover, I found a "more suitable" version. The album cover was altered because the original version was allegedly "too satanic." 
I sympathize with Percy Farrell of Jane's Addiction. I do not think he should compromise by changing his original album cover in order to please the narrow-minded "moral majority." 
Conservative legislators and others are trying to limit my choices as a consumer and are undermining the constitutional rights of many artists.
