Line managers in UK companies perform personnel roles for which they are
ill-equipped, the Institute of Manpower Studies said yesterday.
An IMS report based on case studies in five leading UK companies said there
was widespread tension between line managers and professional personnel
officers. The criticism reflects the resentment between middle managers and
personnel officers in many companies.
The report said personnel officers had difficulty persuading other managers
that handling personnel practices was a line management role.
It suggested that this might sometimes be the fault of personnel teams which
wanted to cling on to as many responsibilities as possible while expecting
others to carry out the work. Its main findings were that:
Line managers had a very limited view of their personnel responsibilities.
Some line managers said they had too much to do without taking on personnel
work as well. Some personnel officers resisted passing responsibilities to
line managers, believing it eroded their standing.
Mr Stephen Bevan, who compiled the report, said: 'A considerable number of
line managers remain unwilling to accept that devolved staff management
responsibility is a legitimate part of their jobs.'
The report said employers needed to clarify personnel roles.
