Police and environmental health officials in Derby are investigating how
bleach found its way into a juice carton after a four-year-old girl was
treated in hospital for burns to her lips and throat.
Refreshment Spectrum of County Durham, which manufacturers the Jurassic
juice drink on behalf of the Coca-Cola Company, said initial examinations
suggested the contamination was an 'isolated incident'.
