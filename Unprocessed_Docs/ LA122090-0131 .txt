Name That School: Musician Frank Zappa doesn't view the possibility of having a new high school named after him as a compliment. Zappa's name is among 132 under consideration by the Antelope Valley Union High School District board for its new school, set to open in 1995. "Considering the sorry state of education in California, it would be more appropriate to name a high school after Ronald Reagan than to name it after me," said Zappa, a 1958 graduate of Antelope Valley High School.
