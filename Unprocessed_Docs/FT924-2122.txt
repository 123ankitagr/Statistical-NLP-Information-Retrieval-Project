ALLSTATE Insurance Company, one of the biggest car insurers in the US and
part of the Sears, Roebuck retail and financial services group, has agreed
to suspend its threatened withdrawal from New Jersey for two years.
The company claimed yesterday that the decision reflected 'a better
relationship' with the state's insurance authorities and the governor's
office.
It also reflected 'renewed hope' that the insurance climate in New Jersey
was becoming less hostile.
Allstate, which is the largest provider of car insurance in New Jersey,
stunned the insurance industry in September 1991.
It announced then that it was seeking regulatory approval to stop writing
virtually all types of coverage in the state. The company blamed years of
losses from its core car insurance operation, and its move was seen as a
direct challenge to New Jersey's governor Jim Florio.
Governor Florio has been strongly sympathetic to consumerist demands,
calling for lower insurance premiums and reform of New Jersey's insurance
laws.
Although insurers have pulled out of certain lines of business in individual
states in the past, Allstate's move threatened to have particularly large
repercussions. It could have affected insurance coverage for around 400,000
cars and 250,000 residences.
Over the weekend, however, the Chicago-based insurer reached a settlement
with the Florio administration, under which Allstate will be permitted to
raise rates modestly and the withdrawal will be suspended.
Aside from a more genial atmosphere, Allstate said that its decision was
influenced by some specific court rulings in New Jersey, certain legislative
action, and a willingness on the part of the authorities to develop a
low-cost car insurance policy.
