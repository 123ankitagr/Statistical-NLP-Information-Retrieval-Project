Sir, Philip Morris's decision to impose swingeing price cuts (UK Company
News, April 13) on its Marlboro brand in the US to safeguard its huge market
share in the face of increasing cut-price competition has led to massive
reductions in the share prices of many of the world's leading branded goods
businesses. Suddenly, and in spite of the strong performance of many of
these businesses throughout the recession, some observers are predicting the
demise of the brand.
Surprisingly, it seems that the markets have missed the point. Brand owners
have always had to be highly sensitive to competition from unbranded
products. In commodity areas such as sugar a brand may have no opportunity
at all to establish a price premium while in an area such as fragrances a
branded product may command a price five or six times above that of the
so-called generic.
But the brand is never a licence to charge whatever the brand owner wishes.
At some point the brand will always be susceptible to cut-price competition.
Clearly. a process of readjustment is taking place in the US cigarette
market. But this does not signal the demise of the brand.
