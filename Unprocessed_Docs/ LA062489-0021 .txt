Mike Downey's article on the Detroit Pistons' Rick Mahorn was so brutally vicious that I will certainly remember it for a long time. 
Downey engaged in merciless butchery of the "Bad Boy," outright destruction of Mahorn's dignity. 
There is only one thing that I can say to Downey after he so utterly attacked Mahorn, the Charles Manson of the basketball court . . . 
Thank you.
