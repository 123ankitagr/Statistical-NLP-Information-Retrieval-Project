An Oxnard man was being held Thursday in Ventura County Jail on suspicion of robbing three banks, the FBI said. 
Victor Murillo Martinez, 32, turned himself in Wednesday night after learning that he was a suspect in three Oxnard bank robberies that occurred in October, February and April, said FBI Special Agent Gary Auer. 
Martinez was being held in lieu of $35,000 bail, Auer said. 
Information from witnesses and videotapes taken during the holdups led FBI agents to believe that Martinez was responsible for the Oct. 31, 1989, robbery at the American Savings Bank, the Feb. 9 robbery at the First Nationwide Bank and the April 20 robbery at a branch of the Security Pacific National Bank, Auer said. 
If Martinez is convicted on federal bank robbery charges, he could be sentenced to a maximum of 20 years and a $5,000 fine for each robbery, Auer said. CAROLYN KUSKY
