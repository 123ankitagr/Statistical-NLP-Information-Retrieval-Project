Jim Lawson, the first All-America football player from Stanford University, has died at age 86. 
Lawson died on Tuesday after a period of ill health. 
He played football for legendary coach Pop Warner from 1922 to 1925, was a Walter Camp All-America end in 1924 and was on the 1925 Stanford Rose Bowl team. 
After college, Lawson played three years for the football New York Yankees. When his pro career ended, Lawson was an assistant coach at Stanford until 1942, when he took over as head coach. He never coached a game, however. Instead he entered the Navy. 
After the war, he joined the staff of the San Francisco 49ers. He left that post to join the coaching staff at UC Berkeley in 1956. 
Lawson is survived by two sons.
