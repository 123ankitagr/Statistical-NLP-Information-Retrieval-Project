Lakewood City Clerk Jack Huntsinger, who has worked for the city for more than 33 years, announced Tuesday night that he will be retiring Jan. 8. 
After serving in the Navy during the Korean War, Huntsinger started his career with the city as Mayfair Park supervisor in 1956, only two years after the city was founded. He left the Recreation Department in 1972 to take an administrative position with the city and became clerk in 1982. 
Once he retires, Huntsinger said, he plans to spend more time at his hobby: officiating at high school football and basketball games. 
"I would also like to visit Japan, where I spent a lot of my time during the war," Huntsinger said.
