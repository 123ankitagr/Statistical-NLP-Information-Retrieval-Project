The city of Costa Mesa is offering its community centers at no charge to groups wanting to sponsor candidates' forums for the November election. 
The city requires that organizations that use its property for such events make the meeting free to the public, give each candidate equal time and allow the city to videotape the event. 
Also, the city plans to publish a calendar of candidates' forums, regardless of whether they are held in city facilities. 
To reserve a community center for a candidates' forum or to have an event published in the calendar, contact Rick Pickering, assistant to City Manager Allan L. Roeder. The phone number is (714) 754-5327.
