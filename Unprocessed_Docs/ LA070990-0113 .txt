The Federal Aviation Administration is keeping an eye on Donald Trump's helicopter service after reports of firings of pilots and allegations of financial improprieties, a published report said today. 
The FAA began surveillance over Trump Air after abrupt firings of several pilots and top managers, allegations of financial improprieties and a takeover of Trump Air by the Taj Mahal casino's security force, the New York Post said. 
Trump's helicopter service, which shuttles gamblers to and from Atlantic City, is struggling to remain in operation in the face of financial difficulties throughout the Trump organization. 
The report said that five pilots were fired last month, along with the chief operating officer and director of flight operations, and that several maintenance workers have resigned.
