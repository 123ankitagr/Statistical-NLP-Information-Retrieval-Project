Does no one in this town repay loyalty anymore? 
We are responding to the May 10 Morning Report that Universal has decided to replace Janet Waldo with the young singer Tiffany as the voice of Judy Jetson in a new Jetsons movie. 
Waldo has been the voice of Judy Jetson from the beginning of the TV series. Just three days before this announcement we had the pleasure of meeting Waldo at a charity function, and her enthusiasm for the movie was catching. She signed autographs for children and enthralled them with the authentic voice of Judy Jetson. 
This town gets scarier every day. What's next? Shaun Cassidy in "Garfield: The Movie"?
