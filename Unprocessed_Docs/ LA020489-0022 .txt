How about a special tax on banking executives who make imprudent investment decisions and on legislators who allow financial institutions to speculate with depositors' money? 
Our politicians and business leaders should stop putting burdens on wage earners who pay taxes and save money, and start punishing those who waste our tax payments and who are trying to confiscate our savings.
