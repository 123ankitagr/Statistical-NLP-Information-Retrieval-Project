London's May robusta COFFEE contract tested Dollars 900 a tonne but fell
back on profit taking. London held its value as New York arabica prices
weakened by about 1.5 cents a lb, encouraging London to firm. Traders said
some producer selling took place in New York but was countered by
good-volume fund buying. The fourth day of the ICO talks in London dwelt
largely on technical issues and had no impact on the market. London COCOA
prices edged ahead in featureless trading, unaffected by the latest Gill &
Duffus estimate of the world deficit at 118,000 tonnes for 1992-93. New York
raw SUGAR prices showed light to moderate gains at midday after nearby
months bounced smartly from downside lows. COPPER edged ahead in US dollar
terms on the LME, supported by some light Chinese buying. But dealers expect
the next big move to be downwards, as fundamentals are unexpiring and stocks
are rising. LEAD prices consolidated, following Wednesday's decline to 6 1/2 year lows; three-month metal closed at Pounds 278.50 a tonne, up Pounds 3.
