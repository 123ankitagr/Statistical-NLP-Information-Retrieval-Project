Opera Pacific of Costa Mesa has signed a 3-year contract with the Opera Pacific Orchestra covering musicians hired to play in the pit orchestra for the company's productions. The contract sets labor guidelines and wage levels for the orchestra through 1991. 
The contract is expected to help establish a stronger identity for the group, whose members include many of the musicians who belong to the Santa Ana-based Pacific Symphony. 
"The public has shown some confusion in differentiating between the Opera Pacific Orchestra and the Pacific Symphony," Lori Green, Opera Pacific director of production, said in a prepared statement. 
"Opera Pacific contracts its musicians independently. Although our orchestra contractor utilizes many musicians who also perform with the Pacific Symphony, the two are completely separate entities." 
The agreement between the orchestra and the opera company was negotiated through Orange County Musicians' Assn. Local 7, American Federation of Musicians. CHRIS PASLES
