Stormie Jones, the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, was in serious condition Wednesday as she battled hepatitis infecting her second transplanted liver. 
Stormie, 13, of White Settlement, Tex., had been listed in fair condition when she was admitted Saturday to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh for testing. Her condition was downgraded when doctors said the tests confirmed that she had hepatitis. 
Infectious hepatitis, a viral infection that inflames the liver, had damaged her first transplanted liver. It was replaced in February.
