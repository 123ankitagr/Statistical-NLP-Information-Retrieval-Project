The Times reported Friday that Columbia Savings & Loan executive Abraham Spiegel was among several influential business leaders who played a pivotal role in 1985 in "persuading" Mayor Tom Bradley to reverse his opposition to Occidental Petroleum's proposed oil-drilling off Pacific Palisades. The assertion oversimplified material in a previous article in The Times, in which Spiegel was identified as one of several business leaders who supported the Occidental position. Friday's article was not meant to imply that Spiegel spoke directly to the mayor on the issue. The mayor said Friday that he made an independent judgment on the Occidental plan, and did not discuss it with Spiegel or any other business leader.
