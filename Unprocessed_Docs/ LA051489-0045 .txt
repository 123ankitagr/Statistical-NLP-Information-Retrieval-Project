The Times' editorial "Half-Won Insurance Victory" (May 7) states that Proposition 103 does not deal with the insurance problem but only with the symptoms; I disagree. There is abundant evidence that the insurance industry, which Proposition 103 will restructure, is the problem. 
Once it is fully implemented, with the insurance industry under the control of an elected insurance commissioner who has rate-setting authority and complete information on the financial status of each company, Proposition 103 may provide the affordable liability and casualty insurance that we need. 
Without first finding out whether Proposition 103 has fixed the insurance problem, there is no justification for urging the Legislature to adopt no-fault insurance which the voters soundly rejected last November.
