A Pounds 4m plan to ease traffic flows at one of Britain's worst congestion
spots came into operation yesterday.
Mr Roger Freeman, roads and traffic minister, opened a hi-tech control
centre at the Blackwall Tunnel in east London.
A joint venture between the Metropolitan police and the Department of
Transport, the centre has 36 closed-circuit TV screens and computers to
monitor traffic in the tunnel and surrounding roads.
