Managers in smaller companies often lack the time to find out about
technical developments which might be of value to them.
Small and medium-sized companies in the north-west will be able to tap into
the research and consultancy skills at eight local universities and colleges
under an initiative which has been launched by Manchester Business School
and Nimtech, a technology centre.
