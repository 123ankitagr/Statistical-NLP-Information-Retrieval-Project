County prisoners would be used to remove graffiti on public property under a suggestion made by Oxnard Mayor Nao Takasugi. 
City Atty. 
Gary Gillig said he would research the idea, adding that the city Parks and Recreation Department already has a contract with Ventura County to use parolees to help maintain city parks. 
Gillig said he is not sure how many parolees are involved in that program. 
Takasugi, who is up for reelection in November, launched a war on graffiti last month, instructing city staff to draw up a plan of attack. 
In response to his request, City Manager Vernon G. Hazen recommended a week ago that the city offer a reward of up to $250 for anyone who reports and helps apprehend graffiti vandals. 
Hazen also organized a meeting of representatives of several city departments to discuss the problem. One of the suggestions that resulted was to charge property owners for the cost of removing graffiti from residences and businesses. 
Among other ideas for reducing graffiti, staff members suggested that the city adopt an ordinance banning the sale of aerosol paints to minors. 
Final consideration of all the recommendations will take place sometime in the next two weeks, city officials said. HUGO MARTIN
