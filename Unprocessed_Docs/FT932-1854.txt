THE RATE of growth in German money supply slowed in May, encouraging hopes
that the Bundesbank may shortly resume its cautious programme of interest
rate reductions.
However, expansion in the broad M3 measure, reconfirmed yesterday as the
main factor governing the central bank's monetary policy, still exceeded the
central bank's target range.
Credit growth accelerated again and there was a strong rise in public sector
borrowing from banks. These factors helped drive annualised, seasonally
adjusted M3 expansion to a provisional rate of 6.7 per cent, down from 7 per
cent in April, but above the central bank's target band of 4.5 per cent to
6.5 per cent.
Frankfurt economists expect M3 will soon fall back within the Bundesbank's
parameters, and thus allow continued gentle easing of monetary policy. After
yesterday's news on money supply and further cuts in other European interest
rates, a further quarter-point fall in Germany's 7.25 per cent discount rate
is widely expected at the central bank's next meeting on July 1.
However, the scope for fulfilling international requests for more radical
action remain constrained by Germany's mounting public sector deficits and
the weakness of the D-Mark.
Public borrowing, including loans to the Treuhand privatisation agency and
other state enterprises, is one of the main forces behind recent growth in
M3, and has been heavily criticised by senior Bundesbank officials.
According to new industrial surveys, private sector capital investment is
rapidly drying up as recession takes its toll.
Questioned yesterday on developments affecting the stability of the D-Mark,
Mr Johann Wilhelm Gaddum, recently nominated as the next vice-president of
the Bundesbank, insisted that foreign exchange rates did not guide bank
policy. M3 remained the key indicator.
Confidence in the D-Mark, which has lost more than 3 per cent of its
trade-weighted value since February, would not be helped if the bank
departed from its traditional policies, he said.
