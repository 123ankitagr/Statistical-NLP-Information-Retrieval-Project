UNITED Airlines , American Airlines and Continental said they were matching
rival Delta Air Lines' transatlantic fare cuts in markets where they
compete, Reuter reports.
In Texas, Continental filed a federal court lawsuit charging AMR's American
Airlines unit with 'predatory acts' involving recent domestic fare
reductions.
American, based in Dallas, denied the allegations and asked a court in
Chicago to declare its pricing practices legal.
