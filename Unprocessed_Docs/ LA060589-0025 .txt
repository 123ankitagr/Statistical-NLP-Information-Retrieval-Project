Tim McCarver, who has worked on ABC's national baseball telecasts since 1984, will join Brent Musburger as a commentator when CBS takes over baseball in 1990. 
CBS outbid ABC and NBC, which have traditionally carried baseball, and will pay $1.1 billion over four years for the rights. 
McCarver, a former major league catcher, also broadcasts New York Mets games on WWOR-TV in New York.
