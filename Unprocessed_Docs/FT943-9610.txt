The signing of an aircraft manufacturing deal this week between China and
Boeing marks a further significant penetration by the west's aerospace
industry into China's rapidly expanding civil aviation business.
Like its competitors, Boeing knows that in signing its biggest manufacturing
agreement with China, involving Chinese production of a fuselage section of
the US manufacturer's popular 737 twin engine airliner, it is playing for
high stakes. There is big money for western manufacturers and airlines in
what has become the world's third-largest aviation market after the US and
Japan.
For China, the stakes are equally high. Boeing's increasing involvement in
the country's aviation sector, together with other international airlines
and manufacturers, should improve air safety after an era in which standards
have been sacrificed for rapid growth. Since the Beijing government
sanctioned the development of regional airlines in the 1980s, a combination
of lax regulation and heady expansion has led to an alarming number of fatal
air crashes.
'What we are seeing is an industry trying to do it all at once,' said Mr Tom
Gallagher, a senior vice-president of the US Chase Manhattan bank. The
Chinese are trying to set up airlines, build airports, buy aircraft, train
pilots, and develop maintenance capability and a safe and unified air
traffic control system, while air traffic grows by more than 20 per cent a
year.
'This adds up to a most daunting task. Will China be able to pull it off?'
Mr Gallagher asked recently.
Some 500 people have died in air crashes in China since 1992. The accident
in June involving a China Northwest Airlines Russian-built Tupolev TU-154,
killing 160 people, again focused attention on what the Chinese civil
aviation authorities had warned were inadequate airline safety standards.
Only a few days before the China Northwest crash near the historic city of
Xian - the worst in the country's history - the new head of the Civil
Aviation Administration of China launched an air safety drive, after
revealing that 'several tens' of near-accidents had occurred this year,
including aircraft going off runways and engines 'stopping in mid-air'.
'The Chinese have realised they have been getting a bit thin to ensure
safety standards and they have decided to curb growth a little to ensure
better safety,' said Mr Pierre Jeanniot, director-general of the
International Air Transport Association (IATA), the trade organisation
grouping 224 airlines which China joined last year.
The unfavourable attention drawn to China's air safety record by the Xian
crash is expected to hasten a process already under way. Chinese airlines
are seeking closer ties with foreign carriers to help them upgrade safety
and cabin service, as well as securing greater co-operation between China
and western aircraft manufacturers.
China recently announced it was opening its aviation sector, including
airlines, airport terminals, maintenance and catering facilities, to foreign
involvement, with a 35 per cent ceiling on foreign investment. While
representatives of foreign carriers are scouring the country looking for
joint ventures, establishing partnerships will not be easy given the gap
between business cultures and operating procedures.
In spite of the difficulties, several foreign carriers are lining up to do
business in China:
British Airways is among a group of large international airlines stepping up
efforts to participate in the modernisation and expansion of the Chinese
airline market. 'We feel there are considerable long-term opportunities in
China,' said Mr David Holmes, BA's director of government and international
affairs.
BA is already co-operating with China Southern, the Guangzhou-based carrier
and one of the eight largest Chinese airlines operating western aircraft. BA
has formed a joint engineering venture with China Southern and has recently
sold the airline computer services. It is also talking with Shanghai-based
China Eastern Airlines about pilot training, engineering and computer
reservation systems.
Although BA is not pushing at this stage to take a stake in one or more
Chinese airlines, its longer-term ambition is to negotiate a marketing
agreement with a large Chinese carrier to co-ordinate services at Beijing
airport. Qantas, the Australian carrier in which BA has acquired a 25 per
cent stake, is targeting smaller regional carriers and has been in
discussion with airlines in Shenzhen, Shanghai and Yunan, but officials
stress these are only preliminary talks.
Lufthansa of Germany was among the first big international airlines to
invest in China. Its maintenance joint venture with Air China at Beijing
airport called Ameco (the Aircraft Maintenance and Engineering Corporation)
employs nearly 4,000 people. Also in Beijing, the German carrier recently
inaugurated an aeronautical apprentice training centre; it has also opened
an office, shopping and hotel complex in the Chinese capital.
The US Lockheed group and Hutchison China Trade Holdings are involved in an
aircraft maintenance venture with China Southern in the south of the
country.
Singapore Airlines (SIA), Cathay Pacific and Japan Airlines have invested in
a maintenance facility with Xiamen Airlines, south of Shanghai.
'China is one of the three major growth areas we have targeted for the next
decade, together with India and Vietnam,' said Dr Cheong Choong Kong, SIA's
managing director. SIA, one of the world's consistently profitable airlines,
has been approached by several Chinese carriers and has already provided
technical co-operation to Chinese regional airlines for the past five years.
It has recently taken a 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's ground
handling service company and another 40 per cent stake in Beijing airport's
in-flight kitchen company providing meals for airlines operating in and out
of the capital.
These initiatives will almost certainly be just the beginning of more
extensive links between Chinese carriers and foreign airlines and service
organisations. 'Most of China's airlines are looking for assistance in a
number of important areas such as pilot training, engineering and
maintenance, and ground and cabin service training,' explained the Beijing
representative of a large European carrier.
China's increasing preoccupation with safety and improving industry
standards is also expected to continue encouraging Chinese carriers to buy
modern western airliners.
Recent studies indicate that China will experience explosive growth in
demand for western aircraft, with one forecast predicting a fivefold
increase to the year 2010 in the country's current commercial aircraft fleet
of about 350 airliners. According to Chase Manhattan, China's requirements
in the next 15 years might exceed 1,200 new aircraft worth Dollars 90bn.
This is far more than previous forecasts by, among others, Boeing, which
predicts demand for 800 aircraft worth Dollars 40bn, and the European Airbus
consortium, which expects China to buy 620 aircraft between now and 2011 to
replace older, largely Soviet-built aircraft and provide capacity for
growth.
Chase's forecast is based on passenger growth of 20 per cent annually until
1998, dropping to 15 per cent a year to 2004 and then to 10 per cent a year
in the six years to 2010. However, after surging 33 per cent in 1992,
passenger growth slowed to less than 20 per cent last year, in part
reflecting the credit squeeze instituted by the Chinese authorities last
July.
Even if Chase's assessment proves to be wildly optimistic, there is no doubt
that the Chinese market will continue to be the world aviation industry's
biggest prize for the foreseeable future. In 1974, the country's civil
aviation fleet had just 12 aircraft. Last year alone, Boeing delivered 46
airliners to China or 14 per cent of its 1993 production totalling 330
aircraft. China will take delivery of 36 additional aircraft this year,
which again will account for 14 per cent of Boeing's total 260 airliners
this year.
Boeing staff also provide support for Boeing aircraft in 13 cities
throughout China. The US manufacturer trained more than 800 pilots and
maintenance engineers from China last year, is advising the Chinese
authorities on air traffic control systems and procedures, and since 1980
has bought parts made in China for its aircraft programmes.
Boeing's European rival, Airbus, clinched orders worth about Dollars 1.2bn
last year and now has three Chinese airlines operating Airbus equipment,
including China Eastern in Shanghai, China Northwest in Xian and China
Northern in Shenyang. In addition, two Chinese manufacturers - the Shenyang
Aircraft Corporation and the Xian Aircraft Company - make parts for Airbus
aircraft.
McDonnell Douglas, the other US airliner manufacturer, has also sought to
build close ties with China through joint production of MD-82 twin-engine,
150-seat airliners with the Shanghai Aviation Industrial Corporation.
China's market is not only proving a bonanza for aircraft manufacturers, but
for suppliers of a whole range of aviation equipment. Rolls-Royce, for
example, is supplying 42 of its RB211-535 powerplants for Boeing 757s bought
by Chinese airlines, and says it is confident of winning further orders.
But China's current policy of buying or leasing new or virtually new
equipment is proving expensive, especially when considering the low
utilisation rate of modern western aircraft by Chinese airlines. The Chase
study shows that average aircraft utilisation in China remains low, rising
from only 4.7 hours a day in 1990 to 5.2 hours in 1992. This compares with
11 hours for SIA, 10 hours for Cathay Pacific and 8 hours for Korean
Airlines.
Such a low aircraft utilisation rate is largely the result of the country's
inadequate infrastructure, notably air traffic control, the number and
condition of airports, airspace limitations and the need for better trained
ground and flight personnel. It should eventually improve if China goes
ahead with ambitious plans to upgrade 50 airports during the next 10 years,
as well as build an additional 90 airports to bring the total to about 200
by the end of the decade. At present, there are 109 airports in operation,
of which only 40 have instrument-landing systems and only 12 can handle
Boeing 747 jumbo aircraft.
The cost of operating new fleets of western-built aircraft will also
inevitably increase, as the maintenance holiday that comes with a young
fleet gradually disappears. In turn, this will put additional pressure on
building new maintenance facilities and training personnel. For this reason,
Chase recommends that Chinese airlines consider, in the short term at least,
buying or leasing used western aircraft.
The high cost of modernising and expanding its aviation industry has
prompted China and its airlines to seek overseas capital. Shanghai-based
China Eastern and Guangzhou-based China Southern are among 22 Chinese
companies selected for stock market listing abroad. Xian Aircraft
manufac-turing, China's biggest aerospace company, is also one of the chosen
22.
China Southern is said by aviation industry observers to have advanced
furthest in preparation for a New York Stock Exchange listing, but recent
reports suggest that China Eastern may be allowed to go first. Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street investment banks, have been advising
China Southern and China Eastern respectively in what are certain to be
high-profile listings.
While China's poor air safety record may deter some investors, Hong Kong
stock market experts believe this is unlikely to have a significant impact
on the offer price.
'The industry's centre of gravity is moving east and a lot of future growth
will come from China,' says IATA director-general Mr Jeanniot. But he also
warns that the dilemma facing Chinese civil aviation is that, with annual
growth rates of 20 to 30 per cent, 'you simply can't acquire experience that
rapidly'.
Privatisation can provide a solution to funding problems, but it cannot
resolve air safety issues. As Mr Jeanniot emphasises: 'One area of aviation
you will never be able to privatise or corporatise is safety enforcement.' ----------------------------------------------------------------------
