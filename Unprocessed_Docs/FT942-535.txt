Greece will continue to suffer from slow growth and high budget deficits
this year, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development said
in its half-yearly report. GDP would grow by only 1 per cent this year and
1.6 per cent in 1995. The government's target for the 1994 budget deficit
would be hard to attain because government revenue growth would be slow
despite tax legislation introduced in April. 'The (realised deficit) is
likely to exceed the budget target unless measures recently taken to improve
tax compliance prove unusually successful,' the OECD said.
