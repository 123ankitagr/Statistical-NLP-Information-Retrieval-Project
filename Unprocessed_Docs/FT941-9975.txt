Mr Michael Heseltine, the trade and industry secretary, has asked the Office
of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from MAI to remove competition concerns
over its planned acquisition of Anglia Television.
The demand is similar to that made in the case of both Carlton
Communications' acquisition of Central TV and Granada's hostile bid for
London Weekend Television.
In both cases, it was decided not to refer the deals to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission, as long as the enlarged groups reduced their advertising
sales operations to 25 per cent of the total television advertising market
by August 1995.
Anglia's advertising is sold by TSMS, a sales house that also sells
advertising for Central and Ulster Television. MAI's broadcasting company
Meridian, the south of England ITV company, sells through Merlin.
Mr Heseltine said that on the basis of current advice, he expected to be
able to resolve competition concerns without a reference - presumably on the
25 per cent principle.
The Institute of Practitioners in Advertising has called on Granada to
divest itself of some of its television advertising sales interests well
before next August if it succeeds in taking over LWT. Allowing current
arrangements to continue until then, would needlessly increase uncertainty.
