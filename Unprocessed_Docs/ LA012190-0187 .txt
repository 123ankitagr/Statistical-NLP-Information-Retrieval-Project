An 18-year-old man was arrested Saturday and charged with slashing actress Viveca Lindfors and a second person with a razor last weekend. He had been drinking and had taken LSD, police said. 
The man, Peter Bedford, was arrested at a friend's house in Brooklyn after police received an anonymous tip, said Manhattan Chief of Detectives Ronald Fenrich. 
Bedford was charged with two counts of assault and one count of criminal possession of a deadly weapon, Fenrich said. The razor allegedly used in the attacks was not recovered. 
Bedford is accused of slashing Lindfors, 69, and Dennis Beal, 36, on the face and head in separate incidents in Greenwich Village. The attacks occurred about 3 blocks and five minutes apart. 
Both victims said they were accosted by a gang of young people and one member of the gang did the slashing. 
The Swedish-born Lindfors, who appeared in the movie "The Way We Were," needed 27 stitches after the attack. Beal required 40 stitches to close his wound.
