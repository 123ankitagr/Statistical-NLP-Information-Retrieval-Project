REEBOK International, the US sports shoe maker, has been granted a patent
from the US Patent Office for its basic The Pump inflatable shoe technology,
Reuter reports.
Reebok said the patent covered athletic shoes featuring an inflatable
chamber and an on-board inflation mechanism.
A company spokesman said that with the patent it could address unlawful
copying of the concept by other companies in the athletic footwear industry.
Reebok said that as part of a first step in the company's enforcement
programme it filed a patent infringement lawsuit against LA Gear in the
District Court in Massachusetts.
Earlier this month, Reebok International, the US sports shoe maker, posted
disappointing third-quarter earnings.
