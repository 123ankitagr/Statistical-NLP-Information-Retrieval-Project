Economic uncertainty prevented the emergence of any clear-cut trend in the
property industry in July, according to the Investment Property Databank, an
independent research group.
Its monthly index showed a slight shortening of yields to 9.7 per cent,
which resulted in a positive total return in July of 0.1 per cent. This was
an improvement on the June figure but it lagged behind the previous two
months.
The longer-term figures appeared more optimistic, largely because this
summer's results have been better than those of last summer. In the year to
July, total returns improved by half a percentage point to 2.2 per cent, the
highest level for more than two years. In spite of a further decline in
rental values, year-on-year capital depreciation showed some sign of slowing
with an improvement of nearly half a point over the June figure.
The retail sector posted a slight fall in total return in July to 0.5 per
cent. The office sector improved with nearly half a point rise in returns to 0.4 per cent. For the year to July, returns reached -5.4 per cent, nearly a
point higher than last month and the highest 12-month return since October
1990.
Total returns for the industrial sector also improved by nearly half a
point. At 6.2 per cent, the year-on-year total return has fallen to its
lowest level since November.
