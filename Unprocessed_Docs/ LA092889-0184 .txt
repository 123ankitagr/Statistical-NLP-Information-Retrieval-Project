One inmate was killed and 11 injured during a brief riot over prison conditions by nearly 300 maximum-security prisoners at a jail near San Jose, the Red Cross said Wednesday. 
Riot police put down the disturbance Tuesday night by firing shots and tear gas at the La Reforma penitentiary 20 miles outside San Jose, Red Cross director Manuel Salazar said. 
Vice Minister of Justice Maruja Chacon was slightly injured during negotiations when a prisoner threw a stone that struck her head, Salazar said. She was treated at a medical post outside the prison. 
One inmate died of a knife wound to the heart during the riot, and 11 injured were taken to the hospital after police entered the prison to restore order. None of the victims were wounded by police fire, authorities said.
