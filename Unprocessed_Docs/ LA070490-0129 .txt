Mayor Peter F. Buffa sided with critics of the embattled National Endowment for the Arts during a heated discussion Monday night over First Amendment issues and freedom of expression that emerged as part of a lengthy City Council debate over city arts grants. 
"I feel strongly there is a place for government support of the arts," said Buffa, who put forth an unsuccessful motion Monday to increase the city's $175,000 arts budget to $300,000 over the next two years. 
But the 25-year-old NEA, which has recently come under siege for funding a few artworks deemed by some to be obscene or sacrilegious, could stand to change, Buffa said. He said he does not support the position of several arts groups, including South Coast Repertory, that the federal agency should be reauthorized for another five years without restrictions on the content of artworks it subsidizes. 
"I think the NEA is an organization that has been poorly managed . . . and has made some outrageous funding decisions," said Buffa, noting his ideological allegiance with Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita), who wants to impose far-reaching restrictions on NEA-supported works and who has advocated eliminating the agency's entire budget. 
"Rohrabacher is someone I work together with closely and meet with often," Buffa said. "I disagree with the position that the NEA should go along with no changes." ZAN DUBIN
