Public protest has delayed Fillmore City Council action on a request to expand hours at Hurst Concrete Products in the North Fillmore Industrial Park. 
The appeal of a July 5 decision by the Planning Commission, which would allow Hurst to extend its storage yard and ship products around the clock, will be continued at the Sept. 25 council meeting. 
During Tuesday's meeting, 10 residents from the area near the industrial park added their statements to the official appeal of Bill Boren, whose home is adjacent to the concrete manufacturing concern. 
Noise, dust and a failure to fulfill landscaping conditions placed on Hurst by earlier permits were major complaints during a three-hour hearing Tuesday. 
A committee including council members, citizens and representatives from Hurst Concrete will study the issue and recommend solutions to the council next month. JANET BERGAMO
