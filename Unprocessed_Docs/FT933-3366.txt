INTERNATIONAL Business Machines is to make significant changes in its
corporate structure, effective immediately, Reuter reports from New York.
Mr Lou Gerstner, chairman and chief executive, said in an internal
memorandum, released by the company, that he was creating a corporate
executive committee which would focus on corporate results, making IBM
business units work in a responsive way to serve customers and minimise
bureaucracy.
'I have reached the firm conclusion that decentralisation versus
centralisation is not our most important organisational dilemma,' Mr
Gerstner wrote.
The new committee will consist of Mr Jim Cannavino, Mr Gerry Czarnecki, Ms
Ellen Hancock, Mr Bob LaBant, Mr Ned Lautenbach, Mr Bernard Puckett, Mr Paul
Rizzo, Mr John Thompson, Mr Pat Toole, and Mr Jerry York.
Each will be part of the IBM corporate office and their principal focus will
be on overall corporate results, not on individual unit performance.
Mr Gerstner added that IBM would rename some units to make the names
understandable and transparent to customers.
