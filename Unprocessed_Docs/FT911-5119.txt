SEVEN leading Japanese brokerages have applied to open representative
offices in Taiwan, despite the threat of condemnation from Chinese
authorities in Peking.
The brokerages said that the main objective of the representative offices
will be to collect information, but the official move is likely to be badly
received in Peking, which has already punished the Bank of Tokyo for opening
an office in Taiwan and opposes any increase in official links with Taiwan.
The seven houses are Nomura Securities, Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities,
Yamaichi Securities, New Japan Securities, Wako Securities and Sanyo
Securities.
An official at one brokerage said that the Japanese securities houses have
already been conducting business in Taiwan through subsidiaries based in
Hong Kong and elsewhere, and that new offices will not change greatly the
substance of their business.
The firms have been selling Japanese equity to Taiwanese investors, and
providing services, such as presenting merger and acquisition information. A
securities house official said that Taiwanese investors who had bought
Japanese stocks before last year's crash in Tokyo had filed complaints that
the lack of official representation had limited their legal rights.
Taiwanese authorities, wanting a means of controlling the operations of the
Japanese houses, demanded that the companies officially file applications to
open offices if they wanted to conduct business in Taiwan.
Peking rejected the Bank of Tokyo's participation in a planned joint venture
finance company last year as a result of opening an office in Taiwan.
The brokerages have been tight-lipped about their operations in Taiwan, but
one official said that China's funding need is expected to limit its
response. China has been sounding out Japanese houses in the hope of issuing
yen bonds in Tokyo.
