A congressman said that FBI agents had warned him his name was on a list found at the home of the man charged with killing militant Rabbi Meir Kahane. Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.) said FBI officials also told him it could mean he was a possible target of terrorists. 
The existence of the list of five New York leaders was reported in New York Newsday. The list also included two federal judges, a former assistant U.S. attorney and a columnist for the weekly Jewish Press. FBI officials declined to comment about the report.
