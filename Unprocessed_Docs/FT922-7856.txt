IF YOU are in your mid-thirties and would like to work in Brussels for the
European Commission, don't bother to apply.
The trouble is, the Commission says, that people approaching 40 do not have
long enough careers ahead of them. This means that most of its jobs carry
age limits of 32 or 35.
The policy, however, came under sharp attack yesterday from Britain's new
employment minister, 37-year-old Mr Michael Forsyth. He said it was 'stupid'
because it prevented the recruitment of people offering many productive
years.
The minister accused the Commission of ageism, widely considered a
regressive employment practice. The UK has more often been on the receiving
end of such allegations.
Mr Forsyth's remarks underline indications by Mrs Gillian Shephard,
employment secretary, that tackling age discrimination will be a priority
when the UK takes over the European Community presidency in July.
The UK employment department has, however, ruled out legislation against
ageism, the approach favoured in the US. 'Sometimes we are accused of being
reluctant Europeans because we do not believe that piling on regulation is
the way forward,' said Mr Forsyth.
Best practice as outlined by the Institute of Personnel Management is for
employers to specify no age limits in adverts or ask for ages on application
forms.
Mr Forsyth told a recruitment industry meeting in London: 'The Commission
has set an age limit of just 35 on most jobs whether you wish to join as a
lawyer or as a messenger.'
He accepted the need for age limits sometimes, ,but said blanket bans could
not be justified.
The Commission says its aim is to recruit individuals who 'can look forward
to a career progression of a sufficient period of time'. It may now review
the practice of specifying age limits in its recruitment literature.
Besides, it says a few senior staff as old as 55 are in any case recruited
and there is no age limit for roughly a third of staff who are on temporary
contracts.
