Cashing in on the megabucks hysteria of "Batman," Bob Kane, the artist who created the "Batman" characters for D.C. Comics back in 1938, has signed a development deal with Nelvana Productions for his latest comic book creation, "Negative Man." The character will be part of a live-action television series that Nelvana hopes to put into production next year. Nelvana, which produced the recently released "Babar" movie, also is working on several animated programs based on some of Kane's other superhero creations. ALEENE MacMINN
