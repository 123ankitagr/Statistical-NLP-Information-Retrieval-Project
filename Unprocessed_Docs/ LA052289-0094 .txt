Three Orange County residents placed among the winners of the 9th annual Music City Song Festival, a national competition for profesional and amateur singers and songwriters. William G. Hinkle of Laguna Niguel won a $500 first prize in the Middle-of-the-Road/Adult Contemporary vocal category for his song, "I'm All Brand New." Ronald Valdez of Fountain Valley came in second in the Amateur Pop/Top 40 songwriting category for "Distant Heart," co-written with Susan Stevens of North Hollywood. Doreen Campbell of Cypress placed third in the Pop/Top 40 song lyrics competition for her lyrics to "How Did I Fall for You?" 
The Nashville-based competition is judged by panels of music-industry professionals who review taped entries or lyric sheets.
