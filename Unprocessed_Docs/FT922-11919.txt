Sir, I am sorry that Barrie Bain (Letters, April 18) had difficulty with
city telephone dialling codes for the former Soviet Union. But if he had
telephoned Mercury's international directory assistance service (available
to Mercury customers by dialling 153), help and advice would have been
readily available.
Mercury now carries more than one-third of the UK's telephone traffic to the
Commonwealth of Independent States, including all the area codes established
under the former Soviet Union. To help satisfy the rapidly growing demand
and improve the erratic quality of their international telephone service,
the Russian republic is introducing competition, a move which we at Mercury
enthusiastically support. This has resulted in some extra area codes being
allocated to newly licenced carriers. Mercury is opening service with these
organisations as they become operational.
One of these new carriers is Metropolitan Communications, in which Mercury's
parent company, Cable and Wireless, has a significant interest (FT Companies
and Markets: 'C&W in joint venture to provide Russian networks', April 15).
You may rest assured that the Cable and Wireless Group is taking CIS
communications very seriously indeed.
