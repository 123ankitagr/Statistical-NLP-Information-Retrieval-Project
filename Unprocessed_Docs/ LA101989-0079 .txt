Mark Smith, 32, of Montrose, won a $15,000 Mazda Miata Wednesday morning on KIIS-FM's Rick Dees Show and promptly turned the prize over to the Red Cross earthquake fund to aid victims of Tuesday's Bay Area disaster. Smith won the prize for naming the right radio tune. The management of KIIS-FM decided to match Smith's $15,000 gift and awarded him another car -- demanding that he keep it. "I still don't know what I'm going to do," said Smith, senior program director of the Crescenta-Canada Family YMCA. "I may yet give this one up too. It's been a crazy day." ALEENE MacMINN
