Your editorial calling for Wright to resign puzzles me. The charges presented so far are, by admission of the Ethics Committee, based on suspicion, not hard evidence. If the evidence is produced, then he should resign. 
What puzzles me is that there is now emerging from the North trial (evidence) that both Ronald Reagan and George Bush were involved in the illegal activities and were impeachable. The information emerging is far more credible at this point than the charges against Wright. So why aren't you calling for Bush to resign? Is it hypocrisy?
