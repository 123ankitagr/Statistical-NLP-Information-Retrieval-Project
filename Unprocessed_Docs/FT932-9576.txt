The Internet is the precursor of the high-speed 'information superhighways'
that President Bill Clinton hopes to see built in the US to enable
businesses and individuals to transmit data at speeds of up to a gigabyte
per second.
Although these highways are not yet in place, the Internet is providing a
glimpse of what can be expected in the 21st century.
In recent congressional testimony, Vinton Cerf, president of the Internet
Society, compared this emerging 'information infrastructure' with the
transportation system: 'The computer is the automobile of this emerging
information infrastructure. Laptops are the sports cars; desktops are the
sedans; supercomputers are the Formula One racing engines; and gigantic
mainframe data storage systems are the 18-wheelers. The local access
networks of the Internet are the neighbourhood streets; high-capacity
computer networks are the highways; switching systems form the complex
interchanges.
'Just as vehicles on the road can be filled with an endless variety of
people and products performing a multitude of services, software
applications fill the empty computing vessels to create the new products and
services of the information infrastructure.'
Cerf offered examples of how the Internet is already being used:
A professor at the University of Southern Louisiana offered to teach a class
through electronic mail on the Internet; 15,000 people asked to join the
class.
When President Clinton and Vice-President Gore visited Silicon Valley to
launch their technology policy, the audio and video - as well as the text -
of their speeches were 'multicast' on the Internet to hundreds of sites.
Wellington, New Zealand, is using Internet to promote its tourist industry.
A blind student uses Internet to access libraries around the world that can
provide on-line versions of Shakespeare's plays which can be converted to
speech by his desktop computer.
