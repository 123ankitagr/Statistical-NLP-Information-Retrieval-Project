Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley today vowed that he would not resign, despite a recent allegation that he had a conflict of interest between his private finances and his public role. 
"To anyone who has any such thoughts, I'll be around here four years from now, as mayor of this city," Bradley said. 
A city auditor revealed Monday that someone had tried to "white out" a notation indicating that the mayor had directed that city funds be deposited at Far East National Bank, which had employed him as an adviser. 
But the mayor said today that he did not know why his name appeared to have been obliterated on the city treasury document.
