The Ventura City Council today will consider applying for a $50,000 grant from the National Endowment of the Arts to place public art at the Ventura Pier. 
The public art grant request would be added to a $3.5-million package put together by the city and the state of California to restore the pier, which is the largest of its kind in the state but has deteriorated so much that its outer portion is closed. 
A Ventura parks spokeswoman said she is optimistic that the city will get the NEA grant if it applies. SANTIAGO O'DONNELL
