Japan's new emperor said today he will help safeguard the democratic constitution, and leftist politicians urged vigilance against any government effort to use the monarchy for "reactionary" ends. 
One Communist and five Socialist legislators boycotted the ceremony at which Emperor Akihito pledged himself to the constitution imposed by the United States after World War II, but two Socialists did attend. 
Those who stayed away said the monarchy's close links to the Shinto religion violate the constitutional separation of state and religion. They were invited in their capacities as chairmen of parliamentary committees. 
Outside the Imperial Palace, nearly 315,000 mourners signed registers of condolence for Emperor Hirohito, who died of cancer last week at age 87. His 62-year reign was marked by the rise of militarism, defeat in the war and Japan's emergence as a leading economic power. 
Akihito, 55, is expected to be closer to the people than his father, who was thought a living god until he renounced the concept of imperial divinity after World War II. 
In his first speech as emperor, Akihito said he would continue on Hirohito's path, "making his desire to constantly be at one with the people my desire as well, joining together with you to preserve the constitution of Japan."
