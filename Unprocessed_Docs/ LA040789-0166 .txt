Temperatures in Orange County reached record highs for the fourth consecutive day today. 
At noon, the temperature in Santa Ana was 99. At El Toro Marine Corps Air Base it was 95 at 1 p.m. and at Fullerton Airport it was 97 at that hour. The previous record high for this date in Orange County was 91 degrees, recorded in 1939 in the city of Orange. 
The past three days have been the hottest ever in April in Orange County. On Thursday a 112-degree reading was recorded in El Toro. 
But today will be the last day of record-setting heat, according to Pat Cooper, a meteorologist for WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
"Over the weekend it looks like we'll have more of a sea breeze. The ridge of high pressure that's bringing the hot weather will break down," she said. 
But Cooper still expects weekend temperatures in the 90s around the county and she added that some areas may reach 100-degree readings. By Monday or Tuesday, she said, temperatures will drop to the 80s inland and the 70s along the coast.
