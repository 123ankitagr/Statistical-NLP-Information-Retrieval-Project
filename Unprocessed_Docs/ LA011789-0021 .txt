Harbor Police, responding to a reported jumper from the San Diego Coronado Bay Bridge at 1 a.m. Monday, were unable to find a body after searching the bay. 
San Diego police said witnesses reported seeing someone get out of a red sports car and jump over the side of the bridge. 
"We don't know if it's the owner of the car or some other person who jumped," said Lt. William Brown. "And whether it's a hoax, we don't know."
