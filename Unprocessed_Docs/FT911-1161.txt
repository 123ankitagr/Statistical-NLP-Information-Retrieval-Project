BELL Atlantic and Ameritech, the two US telecommunications companies which
last year bought New Zealand Telecom, have confirmed they were part of a
consortium buying control of Sky Entertainment, the New Zealand pay
television network.
The consortium, which includes Time Warner, the US media and entertainments
group, is paying more than NZDollars 100m (USDollars 59m) to buy 51 per cent
of Sky. This represents a handsome profit for the individuals and companies
which floated Sky last year.
The US companies are reported to be hoping to use New Zealand as a base for
a similar venture in Australia, which does not yet have Sky pay television.
The consortium is paying NZDollars 100m for control and injecting a further
NZDollars 25m in new capital. Last year, Bell Atlantic and Ameritech paid
NZDollars 4.25bn for NZ Telecom, and they are planning a share issue before
September to the New Zealand public and internationally.
The issue was required by agreements with the New Zealand government that
they reduce their stakes.
The agreement to buy Sky throws together a remarkable range of companies,
including the four American ones and New Zealand's Clear Communications,
which was set up to compete with Telecom, as well as Television New Zealand
which previously was a shareholder in Sky.
There have been reports that Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are also keen to
buy Australian Telecom and the Australian satellite system, Aussat, when
they are privatised.
