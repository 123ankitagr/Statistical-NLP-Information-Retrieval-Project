Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey recently lost a bid for the city manager's job in Cincinnati. 
A recruiter there said Shirey, the second-highest Long Beach city official, was one of two finalists interviewed for the Cincinnati post earlier this month. 
After two days of interviews, Gerald Newfarmer, former city manager of San Jose, was selected. 
"Close, but no cigar," said Shirey, 41. 
Shirey said the job appealed to him because "it gave me the opportunity to run a city rather than having the No. 2 job." He has been assistant city manager in Long Beach for three years. 
Recruiter Norman Roberts said that he had tried to lure Shirey away from Long Beach several times before the Cincinnati opening but that Shirey was not interested. 
"I have an excellent job in Long Beach," Shirey said. "I'm not looking for another job. But I'll keep my eyes open."
