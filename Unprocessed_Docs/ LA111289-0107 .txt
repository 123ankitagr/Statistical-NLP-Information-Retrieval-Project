A military plane crashed Friday in a mountainous area in southern Lesotho, killing all 15 people on board, the government said. 
The plane, which crashed shortly after takeoff, was en route to a military base in Maseru, the capital, from the town of Qachasnek, military headquarters said. 
There were three crewmen and 12 other military personnel on board the twin-engine plane, a Spanish-built CASA-212. 
An investigation was begun. 
Lesotho is a small, mountainous kingdom surrounded by South Africa.
