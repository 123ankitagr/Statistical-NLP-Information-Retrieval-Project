Mayor Tom Bradley flew to Japan on Wednesday to participate in a centennial celebration for the city of Nagoya, which has been one of Los Angeles' sister cities for 30 years. 
Nagoya, Japan's third-largest city, has a population of 2.5 million and is located in the center of the country. It is noted for its strong emphasis on city planning and urban design. 
The Japanese government declared 1989 the year of design, and in keeping with the theme, Bradley will speak at the opening ceremony of the World Design Exposition on Friday. He is due to return to Los Angeles on Monday. 
On Saturday, Bradley will participate in a summit where leaders from Nagoya, Los Angeles and the Japanese city's two other sister cities, Mexico City and Sydney, Australia, will share ideas about planning, housing, family care and a host of other issues.
