A bomb exploded today at a religious shrine less than a mile from where the late Emperor Hirohito's funeral will be held, and police said leftists opposed to Japan's imperial system were suspected of planting it. 
No one was injured in the explosion at about 4 a.m. at the Togo Shrine in central Tokyo, said a spokesman for the Metropolitan Police Agency.
