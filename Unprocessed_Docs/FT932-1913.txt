A SURVEY of 150 managing directors in Avon has found an increase in the
amount of bad debts. A fifth of directors said there had been a fall in bad
debts over the past six months, but a third said there had been an increase.
The survey was carried out by law firm Burges Salmon for Bristol Chamber of
Commerce and Initiative. It defined bad debts as those outstanding for at
least six months.
