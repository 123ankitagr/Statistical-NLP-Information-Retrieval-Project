Degradable Plastic Boycott Sought: "Don't get Glad, get mad," two national environmental groups declared as they called for a boycott of plastic products being marketed as degradable. In a joint report, "Degradable Plastics: the Wrong Answer to the Right Question," the Environmental Defense Fund and Environmental Action contend that Hefty and Glad trash bags and Nappies and Tender Care diapers, among other products made from the new plastics, claim environmental benefits that "are either nonexistent or have yet to be demonstrated." But the groups' chief objection is that the degradables will cripple fledgling attempts to recycle traditional plastic products.
