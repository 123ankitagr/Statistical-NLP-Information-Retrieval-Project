The city attorney's office will not file charges against 43 people -- including a stockbroker, pop singer Appolonia and an accountant -- arrested on drug charges last September at MacArthur Park because of "procedural glitches" encountered by the arresting officers, police said Thursday. 
When the cases were referred to the city attorney, they were not accompanied by analyses of the substances seized, police spokesman Lt. Fred Nixon said. 
Arresting officers believed they could wait for a more comprehensive laboratory analysis and submit that later, he said. But when the cases arrived with no analyses of the substances at all, the city attorney decided not to pursue the cases, Nixon said. 
"We have since straightened out our procedures on administering tests of drugs that are seized, and we hope this won't happen again," the lieutenant said.
