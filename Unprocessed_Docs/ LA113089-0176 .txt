A groundbreaking ceremony will take place at 8 a.m. today for the extension of Chino Hills Parkway through the city. 
The extension is expected to ease the traffic flow from the east. The road was the pivotal point in an out-of-court settlement between Diamond Bar and San Bernardino County in which the city promised to remove barricades on Grand Avenue by September, 1990, in exchange for the county's help in building other roads to siphon off Grand Avenue traffic through Diamond Bar. San Bernardino also paid $1.2 million for traffic signals and road improvements in the area. 
The county had sued the city earlier this year, claiming the barricades -- erected amid concerns that a single road through Diamond Bar would exacerbate traffic problems -- illegally obstructed a public right of way. 
The groundbreaking ceremony will be at the intersection of Phillips Ranch Road and Scenic Ridge Drive.
