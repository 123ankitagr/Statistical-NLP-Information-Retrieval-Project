El Toro High School quarterback Steve Stenstrom has made an oral commitment to play football at Stanford University, according to his father, Pete Stenstrom. 
Stenstrom passed for 4,604 yards during his two-year career with the Chargers. Last season, he completed 178 of 270 for 2,830 yards and 25 touchdowns in leading El Toro to the Southern Section Division III championship game. 
The Chargers lost to Paramount, 26-20, in the title game. 
Stenstrom was named to the All-Orange County first team last season. 
Besides Stanford, Stenstrom also visited the University of Iowa. He had scheduled trips to Oregon and Princeton, but canceled them after visiting Stanford. CHRIS FOSTER
