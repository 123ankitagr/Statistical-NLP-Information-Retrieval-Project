A parole board rejected freedom for the seventh time for mass murderer Charles Manson, convicted leader of the infamous "family" that murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate and eight others in 1969. "He's still at war with society and definitely a danger," said Albert Leddy, chairman of the three-member panel of the state Board of Prison Terms, which voted unanimously against parole. Manson declined to attend the hearing at San Quentin after a dispute over whether he would be shackled. The board considered the latest psychiatric study and his prison history, which listed six citations for behavioral problems since his last hearing. Outside, three men and a woman demonstrated in favor of Manson's bid for parole, waving signs, one of which read, "Find A New Boogieman, Give Charlie A Break." "It's sort of a human rights thing," said demonstrator Tina Williams of San Francisco. "Everybody in America should be allowed a fair hearing and he didn't get one."
