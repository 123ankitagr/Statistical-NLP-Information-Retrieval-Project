Phil Norman, a longtime radio and television personality, has died at his Tarzana home. He was 79. 
Norman died Wednesday of heart failure, said his wife, Helen Norman. 
Born Feb. 10, 1911, in Columbus, Ohio, Norman worked for radio stations in Ohio before going to McCann-Erickson Advertising Agency in New York, where he became associate producer of the New York Philharmonic and Arturo Toscanini concerts. 
In 1950, he came to Hollywood, were he did the Housewives' Protective League show during the day and the Phil Norman Show at night for about 12 years on KNX-AM radio. 
In the early 1960s, he did a daytime radio show on KBIG radio and in the mid-1960s, he did an interview show on KTTV-TV. Norman later appeared weekly on an ABC-TV network early morning show as a food raconteur, before his retirement from the entertainment field in the early 1970s. In his retirement years, he worked in advertising, merchandising and promotion of the food industry. 
He is survived by his wife of 25 years, and daughter Stephanie Norman of North Hollywood. 
Funeral services will be private and arrangements are being handled by J.T. Oswald Mortuary in Reseda. Donations can be made in Norman's name to the American Lung Assn.
