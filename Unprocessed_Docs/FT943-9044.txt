Broken Hill Proprietary, the Australian natural resources group, yesterday
said it was seeking environment approval to build a direct reducted iron
(DRI) plant in Western Australia's Pilbara region for more than ADollars
750m (USDollars 551.4m).
While the move does not mean BHP has decided to go ahead with the project,
it does indicate that final feasibility studies are in progress.
BHP stressed that board approval for the plant, negotiation of
'satisfactory' natural gas supply and price arrangements, and 'successful
completion of definitive engineering and economic feasibility studies' were
still required.
But if these conditions were met, construction of the plant near Port
Hedland, about 1,200km north of Perth, could start in the middle of next
year and be completed by 1997.
Capacity would be around 2m tonnes a year of hot briquetted iron (HBI). The
DRI process involves the reduction of high grade iron ore concentrate using
natural gas. The iron produced is made into small briquettes, which can be
fed directly into the new generation of mini-mills.
