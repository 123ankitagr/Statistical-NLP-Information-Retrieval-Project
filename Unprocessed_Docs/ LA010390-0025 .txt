I am sure that your article correctly reported the results of the hearing that banned offshore drilling in California waters, so I am appalled that such a momentous step was taken using scare tactics that to any reasonable person should have dictated exactly the opposite result ("Off-Limits Signs Go Up Offshore," Part A, Dec. 7). 
That a couple of politicians such as Gray Davis and Leo McCarthy could use the Exxon Valdez as an excuse to ban oil drilling offshore means that they are deliberately distorting or ignoring facts that every schoolchild should recognize. 
The Exxon Valdez oil spill, which was used as the primary argument for the drilling ban, was a tanker spill, not an oil drilling accident. The sheer size of this catastrophe was made possible by the concentration of oil production of many wells into one vessel in the hands of a negligent and very cavalier oil company. It should be punished accordingly. 
The truth of the matter is that we have only three places to get the oil we use so profligately in California: domestic production (declining and under great pressure from "environmentalists"); offshore oil drilling in our own waters (with a good environmental record), and guess what -- giant tankers from Alaska and foreign producers, each carrying millions of gallons of oil. 
Recently I drove the Oregon and Northern California coast and admired its pristine beauty. I'd like to protect it from tanker spills, too. I vote for offshore drilling with strict accountability for safety by the oil companies.
