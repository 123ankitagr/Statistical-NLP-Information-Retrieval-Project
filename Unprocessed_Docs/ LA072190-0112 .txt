The 14th Annual LA Prep Senior Bowl All-Star football game will be played tonight at 7:30 at Veterans Memorial Stadium in Long Beach, with 94 newly graduated high school seniors representing 43 schools participating in a game dedicated to the memory of Kevin Copeland, a Dorsey High athlete who collapsed and died on the field last fall. 
Divided by the Hollywood and Harbor Freeways, the North-East team, coached by E.C. Robinson of Locke, won last year, 10-9, for its fourth victory in the last five games. The South-West is coached by Robert Garrett and Terrell Ray of Crenshaw.
