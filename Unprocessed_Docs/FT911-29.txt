JOHN LABATT, the Canadian food and beverage group, is putting a large part
of its food processing business up for sale in keeping with its strategy of
concentrating on beer, entertainment and dairy products.
Labatt, which is 39 per cent owned by the Brascan group controlled by Peter
and Edward Bronfman, said yesterday it will consider offers for Oregon-based
JLFoods, which specialises in frozen grocery products in Canada, the US and
Britain. JLFoods is the leading supplier of frozen soup in the US, and also
a large supplier of breaded and battered products.
The company has annual sales of USDollars 475m and employs 3,500 people at
13 manufacturing and processing plants, most of them in the US.
Analysts said the sale could fetch about USDollars 300m. The company, which
had sales of CDollars 5.3bn (USDollars 4.6bn) last year, has made no secret
of its eagerness to expand its beer business outside Canada.
Labatt's shares rose by 75 cents to CDollars 23.38 yesterday.
