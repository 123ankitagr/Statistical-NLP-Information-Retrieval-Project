THE US Federal Reserve Board has granted a subsidiary of the Bank of
Montreal powers to deal in commodity derivatives, a decision that is
expected to apply to other US bank holding companies. The Fed ruling will
extend competition between banks and broker-dealers - already fierce in
financial products - to non-financial futures and options.
Before the decision, banks were allowed to trade financial instruments on US
futures and options exchanges, but were barred from clearing or servicing
customer needs in exchange-traded energy or agricultural derivatives.
In its ruling the Fed said Chicago-based Harris Futures Corporation could
execute trades and clear non-financial transactions at the US's three
largest futures exchanges. However, Harris will not be allowed to trade
commodity futures and options for its own account, trade the physical
commodities, or offer commodities investment advice.
In seeking the Fed's approval, Harris Futures said it expected 10 per cent
of its commodity futures and options business to come from large managed
futures funds. Funds have become increasingly interested in commodities as a
means of diversifying financial portfolios.
The Fed's finding that commodity derivatives dealing 'is closely related to
banking', was greeted enthusiastically by Chicago's futures exchanges, where
member banks have been restricted from clearing trades in agricultural
futures and options.
'This action is good for the banks, for the customers, and for the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange,' said CME chairman Mr Jack Sandner.
