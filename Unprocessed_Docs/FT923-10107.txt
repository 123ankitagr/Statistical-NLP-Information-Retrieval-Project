THE world airline industry has had a disappointing first half, with few
signs of a strong recovery in international passenger traffic.
Although traffic rose by 21 per cent in the first half compared with the
same period last year, the International Air Transport Association (Iata)
yesterday said this reflected the abnormal circumstances of 1991, when the
industry was hit by the Gulf crisis travel slump.
Compared with 1990, first-half passenger traffic growth was only 8 per cent
higher, Iata said.
Freight traffic grew 6 per cent in the first half. For June, passenger
traffic was 10 per cent higher and freight traffic 4 per cent higher than in
June last year.
Airlines are also continuing to maintain high capacity levels, which are
putting pressure on yields.
