A LEADING US insurance company yesterday estimated that the industry could
face losses of around Dollars 8bn to Dollars 10bn as a result of Hurricane
Andrew, which left a five-day trail of destruction in Florida and Louisiana.
The estimate, made by Minnesota-based St Paul Companies - which acquired
Minet Holdings in the UK four years ago - came as criticism of the Bush
administration's handling of the crisis in the southern states intensified.
Some of those affected by the disaster claim that relief efforts have been
disorganised, and that much-needed supplies have been slow to arrive.
Television stations in the US have shown pictures of fights breaking out for
ice, for example, and long lines waiting for food shipments.
Yesterday, however, the Pentagon said that 4,500 troops - mainly from North
Carolina - were now in the stricken regions, and that food supplies were
capable of feeding around 72,000 people every 24 hours.
On the insurance front, estimates of the industry's losses have varied in
recent days, but a consensus seems to be forming around the Dollars 10bn
figure.
