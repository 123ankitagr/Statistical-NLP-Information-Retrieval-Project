The former chief of staff of the Soviet Army will testify next week before the House Armed Services Committee, Chairman Les Aspin said today. 
Marshal Sergey F. Akhromeyev will be questioned July 21 about arms control, the Soviet military budget and military cuts announced by Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Wisconsin Democrat said in a statement. 
"This is an unprecedented chance to question a top Soviet military official on our turf by our rules," said Aspin, who was criticized earlier this year when other, lower-ranking Soviet officials appeared before his committee. 
Akhromeyev retired from the military last year but continues to advise Gorbachev.
