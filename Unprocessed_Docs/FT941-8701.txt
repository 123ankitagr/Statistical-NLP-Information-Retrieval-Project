The latest in Japanese consumer electronics is the combined compact disc and
mini-disc system which enables music lovers to compile their own mini-disc
from a selection of their favourite CD tracks.
Developed by Sharp, and resembling a radio-cassette player, the MD-Z1 dubs
CD tracks on to the recordable mini-disc at the touch of a button.
