A man jailed for beating his wife has been indicted for killing Oregon prisons chief Michael Francke last year, an investigator said today. 
Maj. Dean Renfrow said Frank Gable, an inmate at Coos County Jail, was indicted by a Marion County grand jury last week. He said no one else has been indicted in the case and he refused to give other details. 
Gable was scheduled to be released from the Coos County jail Thursday but Renfrow said he took custody of the suspect Sunday morning and took him to the Marion County jail in Salem.
