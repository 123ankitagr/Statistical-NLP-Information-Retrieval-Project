Sir, If the parliamentary timetable is so tight that the government is
obliged to introduce guillotine motions to ensure the passage of its
legislation this week and the opposition has decided to withdraw pairing
co-operation ('Labour halts co-operation with Tories', December 10), why is
parliament starting its Christmas recess on December 17, one week before
most of the rest of the country commences its Christmas holiday?
