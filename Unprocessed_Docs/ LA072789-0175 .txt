Mayor Ernie Kell has reappointed one member of the Long Beach Harbor Commission and extended the term of another, keeping the five-member panel intact for at least another year. 
Kell announced this week that he would not replace Commissioner Louise DuVall, an attorney, citing the need to "maintain the direction and stability of the port." Instead, she will remain in her spot for about another year before any change is considered again, Kell said. 
DuVall, who has been on the commission since 1979, will serve as its president this fiscal year. 
The City Council this week approved the mayor's reappointment of David L. Hauser, a real estate agent, to a second six-year term on the commission. 
The City Council also gave the go-ahead to new appointments to the city's Redevelopment Agency board and Planning Commission. 
Physician Judson R. Schoendorf and James R. Kennelly were appointed to four-year terms on the Redevelopment Agency board, which has five members. They replace Thomas E. Stewart, whose second term ended in May, and Msgr. Ernest Gualderon, whose second term officially ended in 1987 but was extended another two years. 
Dentist Ebenezer Bush will serve a four-year term on the seven-member Planning Commission. He replaces Dr. Horace Rains, who served two terms.
