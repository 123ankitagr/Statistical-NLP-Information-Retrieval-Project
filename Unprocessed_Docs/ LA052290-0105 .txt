There were happy songs, upbeat words, an overflow crowd of 5,000 and a gaggle of Muppet pals at a memorial service Monday for Jim Henson. 
Henson, who used the Muppets he created to entertain and educate children on "Sesame Street" and elsewhere, died Wednesday of pneumonia. 
He was 53. 
Henson had written instructions for his funeral four years ago that were opened after his death. He said he wanted the occasion to be a happy one and that mourners should not wear black. 
An old green coat emblazoned with a frog-shaped piece of scarlet cloth greeted mourners as they entered the church. The coat symbolized one belonging to Henson's mother, from which he was said to have cut material to make the original Kermit the Frog. 
With Big Bird and Harry Belafonte on hand, an organist began the service with a rendition of the "Sesame Street" theme song, "Sunny Day." 
Then the Dirty Dozen Dixieland band strolled in playing, "Please Release Me," followed by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members. 
Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as Belafonte and three backup singers sang, "Turn the World Around," a song Belafonte wrote and Henson used. 
Big Bird, a character played by Carroll Spinney, sang, "It's Not Easy Being Green," a number usually done by Kermit. 
Afterward, Big Bird looked heavenward, said, "Thank you, Kermit," then slowly walked away, head hung low.
