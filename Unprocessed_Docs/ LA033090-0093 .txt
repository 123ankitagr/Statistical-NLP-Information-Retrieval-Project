Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies have stepped up patrols on San Fernando Road in Santa Clarita in response to complaints that day laborers are harassing passers-by and their presence is creating traffic problems and disrupting businesses. 
At city officials' request, the deputies late last week began morning foot patrols on heavily traveled San Fernando Road near Market Street in Newhall. 
As many as 400 day laborers congregate in the area on weekday mornings. 
Capt. Bob Spierer, who heads the Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita, said the issue is safety. "We had a number of complaints from merchants and residents that cars looking for day laborers were stopping and blocking traffic. Some residents said they were being harassed a bit." He said deputies are citing the day workers only if they break the law.
