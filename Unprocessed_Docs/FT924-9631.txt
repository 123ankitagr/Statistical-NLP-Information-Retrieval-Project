AIR Canada has failed to agree terms for a merger with rival Canadian
Airlines International, writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal.
The terms of a pre-merger agreement made by Air Canada and PWA, parent of
Canadian, on October 8 'contained conditions that cannot be met'. The deal
is 'unachievable', Air Canada said.
Under the merger plan, Air Canada and Canadian would have continued as
separate entities while a new holding company would have been formed with
shareholders of each group exchanging their stock for new shares in the
holding company.
