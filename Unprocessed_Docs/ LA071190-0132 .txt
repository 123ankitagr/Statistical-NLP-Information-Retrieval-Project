Mark your calendars, football fans. The Texas Tech Red Raiders of the Southwest Conference are coming to Cal State Fullerton to play the Titans. 
In 14 years. 
The Fullerton athletic department announced Tuesday that it has reached an agreement with Texas Tech on a two-for-one, home-and-home series. 
The Titans will travel to Lubbock, Tex., to play the Red Raiders on Sept. 7, 1991 and Sept. 16, 1995. Texas Tech will travel to Fullerton for a game on Sept. 18, 2004. 
"I'll just roll over from the Gerontology Center for our home game," said Titan Coach Gene Murphy, who will be 65 in 2004. 
Fullerton Athletic Director Ed Carroll described the contract as "a continuation of our commitment to schedule quality opponents at home." 
The Titans now have home-and-home contracts with Colorado State, Temple, Akron, Texas El Paso, Army and Mississippi State. 
The 1991 game against Texas Tech will take the place of a previously scheduled game against Southwest Louisiana, which was dropped by mutual agreement between the two schools. MIKE DiGIOVANNA
