Japan's Emperor Hirohito, who died last month at 87, left assets worth $13.36 million, according to the first public accounting of imperial family private property, the Imperial Household Agency said today. 
Emperor Akihito and Empress dowager Nagako equally divided the estate except for about 3,000 works of art that were donated to the state. 
The agency said the decision was based on consultation among Hirohito's 11 closest relatives, indicating that nine had given up any claim on the estate. 
The royal family's real estate, including about 5,436 acres of land, are exempt from taxation because they are considered state land under the postwar constitution.
