Insurance companies operating in California are bracing themselves for
legislation which would force them to offer earthquake cover.
After a meeting on Monday of Governor Pete Wilson and representatives of 18
insurance companies, a spokesman for Mr Wilson said 'some type of action,
probably legislative action' was likely.
The meeting was called after moves by insurers to retreat from exposing
themselves to further earthquake risks. The insurance industry puts its
losses from the January earthquake in southern California now at Dollars
5.5bn (Pounds 3.6bn), far higher than the industry's initial estimate of
Dollars 2.5bn and the second-biggest US natural catastrophe in insurance
terms after Hurricane Andrew hit Florida in 1992.
Farmers, a subsidiary of the UK's BAT Industries, had decided temporarily to
stop writing homeowners' insurance in the state. The company expects losses
of more than Dollars 1bn from the earthquake. At present, insurers are
required by law in California to offer optional earthquake insurance to
anyone who buys one of their homeowner policies.
Discussions at the meeting focussed on the experience of Florida, which
faced a similar insurance crisis after the devastation caused by Hurricane
Andrew. That catastrophe cost the insurance industry more than Dollars 15bn,
prompting insurers to abandon offering hurricane insurance in the state.
