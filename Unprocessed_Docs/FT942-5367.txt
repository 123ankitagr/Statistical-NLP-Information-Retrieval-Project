Equity investors face a hard decision: when is the best time to enter the
market?
Someone who chose to go in when the market was at its peak in 1987 and the
FT-SE-A All-Share index stood at 1,238, would have had to wait almost four
years before the index reached the same level. A cannier investor, who had
realised that the market would overheat that year and waited to go in at the
low of 784 in November 1987, would, with hindsight, have invested at an
ideal time, almost doubling his money by now.
But getting market timing right is notoriously difficult. One way round the
problem is to to use a regular savings scheme to drip-feed money into an
investment trust.
By doing so, you avoid buying all your shares at the top of the market, and
when the market drops you have the consolation of knowing that your money is
buying more shares. You are protected from the impact of day-to-day
fluctuations in share prices.
Buying fewer shares when prices are high and more when they are low, is
known as 'pound-cost averaging', because the average purchase price of the
shares will be lower than the arithmetic average over the period.
Another attraction of savings schemes is that many providers offer dealing
charges as low as 0.2 per cent, or even nil. The schemes are flexible, in
that you can stop them without penalty, unlike most insurance-related
products such as endowments.
Although monthly savings schemes are acknowledged as a good thing for
smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the market, they tend to be used
through necessity rather than choice. Many people find they can only afford
to feed Pounds 5,000 into the market through a Pounds 50-a-month savings
scheme, rather than come up with the lump sum. However, the relatively small
minimum investment which many of the schemes allow, can obscure the fact
that you could be gaining market exposure only very slowly.
Moreover, equities have risen over the long-term, so, despite pound-cost
averaging, you are likely to do better investing a large sum once instead of
a much smaller one regularly. A crude comparison between a lump-sum
investment and regular savings over the long-term, shows that returns from
the lump-sum investment are almost always higher than those achieved through
the savings scheme.
The comparison is crude because, to be fair, it is necessary to add to the
value of the increasing savings-scheme investment a figure for interest on a
diminishing cash sum yet to be invested and which may be waiting on deposit.
The table below compares the value of investing Pounds 100 a month into
Foreign & Colonial Investment Trust over strategic periods. The return is
compared with the total amount invested over the period, invested as a lump
investment at the beginning of the period.
In all cases apart from one, the investor would have done better with the
lump sum investment. The exception occurs during the period September
1987-September 1990 - before the stock market crash, up to the period after
the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait caused world markets to fall. This was a
turbulent period, at the end of which F&C's share price was lower than at
the beginning.
Monthly savings are not the only option. Many schemes allow you to invest
occasional lump sums, usually of a minimum of Pounds 250. This allows you to
indulge in some market-timing skills. But check when the lump sum will be
invested - some investment trusts take a week or 10 days before buying the
shares. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
