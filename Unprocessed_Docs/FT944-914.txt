North Korea yesterday returned the body of a US army pilot killed when his
helicopter went down over its territory at the weekend and indicated that it
might release his surviving colleague by Christmas, writes John Burton,
Seoul Correspondent.
The delay in the return of the crew has been caused by North Korean
suspicions regarding the US claim that the helicopter strayed accidentally
into its air space, according to a US congressman who conducted 'intensive,
heated and hectic' negotiations on the issue during five days in Pyongyang.
'They were worried about conspiracy theories and acceleration of tension.
But I think it's been proven to them that it was an accident,' said Mr Bill
Richardson, a Democratic representative from New Mexico. The US has been
pressing North Korea to release the crew quickly to avoid jeopardising the
recent accord to dismantle the North's nuclear programme in exchange for
diplomatic ties with Washington.
