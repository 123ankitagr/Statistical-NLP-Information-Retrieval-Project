Chiat/Day Wins American Express Account: Yet another major piece of advertising business has been handed to the Venice-based ad firm Chiat/Day. The agency's New York office won the $20-million American Express Gold Card account. Also, the Gold Card's direct response marketing account will be handled by New York-based Perkins/Butler, a Chiat/Day subsidiary. The Gold Card's previous agency was McCann-Erickson, which retained the American Express Platinum Card business.
