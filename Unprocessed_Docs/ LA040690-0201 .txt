Olympic star and world record holder Florence Griffith Joyner is expecting her first child in the fall, her business manager said today. "She is expecting some time in early November," Gordon Baskin said. 
Baskin said Griffith Joyner, popularly known as "FloJo," is delighted with the news. "This is something she has hoped for for some time," Baskin said. 
Griffith Joyner, 30, set world records in the women's 100 and 200 meters in 1988 while attracting worldwide attention with her colorful outfits. She won three gold medals and a silver at the Seoul Olympics and announced her retirement from the sport last year. 
Her husband is Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple-jump gold medalist who has turned his attention to the 110-meter high hurdles in recent years. 
"He's even more excited than Florence," Baskin said.
