Point Loma, trailing by two points after a see-saw first half, rallied behind the passing of Danny White to defeat visiting Dorsey, 36-34, Friday afternoon. 
Fresh off an upset victory over then top-ranked Rancho Buena Vista last week, Point Loma (2-2) made it two in a row in game marred by 17 penalties. Dorsey is 1-2. 
"I think we hung in with them," Pointers' Coach Ben Edens said. 
Point Loma hung in there until it could put together the big plays it needs to win. 
It got them from Danny White, the county's leading passer, who completed 12 of 19 passes for 226 yards and four touchdowns. 
"We knew they were a good team," White said, "and it came down to a few key plays." 
The Pointers made two key plays at the start of the fourth quarter to turn the game their way. J.J. Stokes caught a 30 yard pass from White to jump ahead 28-22. 
On the next play, Cliff Ransom recovered the ball on an onside kick to give Point Loma another opportunity to score. Brett Callan caught a 48-yard pass from White to make it 34-22. Callan had six catches for 128 yards and two touchdowns. 
Ahead by 12, Point Loma went for the two-point conversion and got it when White passed to Callan. 
The two-point conversion became critical because Dorsey, trailing 36-28, scored with five seconds remaining when Kevin Copeland caught an 18-yard pass from Chris Cook to close the gap to 36-34. Dorsey had to try for two points, but a failed run gave Point Loma the victory. 
Kevin Perreira, one of Point Loma's leading rushers this year, was helped off the field with an ankle injury 10 minutes into the game. 
"We lost a very important ball carrier," Edens said, "but he will be back." 
Point Loma came back without him Friday. LAURA PALMER
