Commuters who use London Underground's Central Line are being warned that
full services will not be resumed until this afternoon at the earliest - and
part of the line may remain closed all weekend.
After a power fault stranded thousands of people in Wednesday's rush-hours,
London Underground suspended the service east of Liverpool Street Station.
The line stayed closed yesterday.
A fleet of 80 buses will continue to serve eight routes this morning, taking
commuters from the eastern ends of the Central Line to the Victoria Line at
Walthamstow, the District Line at Barking, or to British Rail at Stratford.
London Underground said the Central Line east of Liverpool Street might not
be working again until Monday.
The misery began at 7am on Wednesday when a power failure brought the
Underground to a virtual standstill. For up to three hours 20,000 passengers
were trapped on trains, and hundreds had to be led through tunnels to
safety.
London Underground said last night that engineers were inspecting 26 miles
of cabling in an attempt to locate the fault. Once found and repaired, empty
trains would be run along the track to prove the power supply was back.
One of the problems was the intermittent nature of the fault, said an
official, who added: 'We must be sure we have rectified this problem once
and for all.'
Mr Jim Stevenson, chairman of the TUC's south-east region transport
committee, blamed the power failure on government investment cuts.
Mr Alan Norman, the TUC official responsible for London Underground workers,
said: 'The future of London's public transport can clearly no longer be left
to mandarins or ministers who travel around London in chauffeur-driven cars.
Investment must be reinstated at once if we are to prevent a major
disaster.'
