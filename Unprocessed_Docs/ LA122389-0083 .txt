Another fertile Mediterranean fruit fly has been found, this one in East Los Angeles, but no additional pesticide sprayings are planned. 
Don Henry, a spokesman for the Medfly eradication program, said the male fly was found Wednesday on Mednik Avenue, and was the first find in five days. Although the fly was outside the previous infestation area, Henry said the discovery did not arouse as much concern as others have because it was not that far from a previous discovery in South Pasadena. 
An aerial pesticide spraying has been planned for the area on Jan. 9. 
Currently, 277 square miles of urban territory are being treated with malathion to combat the worst Medfly infestation in Southern California history.
