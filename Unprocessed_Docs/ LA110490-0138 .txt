Of all the movie critics in town whose recommendations are suspect, the worst offender is television's Gary Franklin. 
It used to be that Franklin gave rave reviews sparingly, but it seems as though half the full- and double-page ads for major movies now feature a quote from Franklin calling some movie "a 10" or "10 plus." 
Because we all know that barely a dozen movies a year truly are that good, it is ludicrous to believe Franklin when he implies that so many films are among the greatest of all time. 
His obvious zeal for getting his name in print destroys his credibility.
