Ian Lamont of Yorkton, the stockbroker, reckons there are four main types of
football:
Association Football - a game for gentlemen played by hooligans; Rugby Union
football - a game for hooligans played by gentlemen; Rugby League football -
a game for hooligans played by hooligans; and American Football - a game for
Americans played by Americans.
There is also, of course, Gaelic Football: a game for masochists played by
the Irish.
