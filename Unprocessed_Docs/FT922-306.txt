FINLAND'S insurance industry is being restructured through a new grouping
under the direction of Union Bank, the country's largest commercial bank.
This follows agreement between five Finnish insurers to combine, in response
to the integration of the European insurance market in the 19-nation
European Economic Area beginning next year. The new grouping creates the
largest non-life insurance concern in Finland and starts in 1994.
The Sampo insurance company and Industrial Mutual Insurance will merge to
form a non-life insurance group with about 30 per cent of the Finnish
market. Meanwhile, the direct insurance business will concentrate on three
non-life insurance companies under Sampo as the parent company listed in
Helsinki.
A further group will cover life insurance. Union Bank will set up a life
company and establish a division of responsibilities through cross-share
ownership with two other life companies: Kaleva and Nova.
