Mineral exports are expected to boost Australia's commodity sales by 4 per
cent to ADollars 49bn (USDollars 33bn) in 1993-94.
The official forecasting agency, the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and
Resource Economics, said this week that earnings from mineral resources
would rise by 7 per cent to ADollars 31.7bn. Most of the increase was
expected to come from higher exports of gold, coal, crude oil and natural
gas.
In contrast, rural export earnings were forecast to fall by nearly 2 per
cent to ADollars 17.3bn, largely because of falls in wool and grain prices.
The volume of mine production was forecast to rise by 2.6 per cent in
1993-94. Black coal production was expected to reach a record 185m tonnes,
up 7m tonnes. Iron ore output was put at a record 120m tonnes, up 3.5m
tonnes.
Abare also predicted a brighter medium-term commodity outlook. It said
commodity exports would rise by a further 13 per cent to ADollars 55.4bn in
1998-99 (at 1993-94 prices).
