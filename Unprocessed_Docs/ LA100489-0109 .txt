The Costa Mesa City Council has filled three remaining spots on the seven-member board of the new Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Corp., an agency formed in August that hopes to generate millions of dollars for the city's arts programs. Named Monday were Edna G. Bradley of Costa Mesa, who belongs to a support group of the Orange County Performing Arts Center; Russell Cox, general manager of the Red Lion, Orange County Airport hotel; and Edgar Fawcett, general manager of the County Side Inn hotel. The board's first meeting will be announced.
