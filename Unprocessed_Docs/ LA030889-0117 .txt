Pacific Enterprises OKs Holder Plan: The board of Pacific Enterprises, the Los Angeles-based parent of Southern California Gas Co. and Thrifty Corp., has adopted a shareholders' rights plan. The plan is intended to protect shareholders in the event of an unsolicited attempt to acquire Pacific Enterprises. "The plan was not adopted in response to any effort to acquire control of Pacific Enterprises and the board of directors is unaware of any such effort," Chairman Paul A. Miller said. "The plan is not intended to prevent a takeover of Pacific Enterprises and will not do so. However, it should discourage any attempt to acquire Pacific Enterprises in a manner or on terms not approved by the board of directors as being in the best interest of shareholders."
