A financial futures market trading three-month interbank interest rates
could start in Malaysia as early as September, Reuter reports from Kuala
Lumpur.
'We're working toward a September target,' said the Kuala Lumpur Commodity
Exchange. However, the Securities Commission, which will regulate the new
market said: 'It all depends on when the regulatory requirement for a single
clearing house is in place.' The commission urged the Kuala Lumpur Futures
Market (KLFM) and rival Kuala Lumpur Options and Financial Futures Exchange
(Kloffe) 'to work harder at bringing about a single clearing house
facility'.
KLFM, run by the commodity exchange, will initially trade in the three-month
Kuala Lumpur interbank offered rate (Klibor).
Kloffe, which is not expected to begin operations until late next year, will
trade in stock index futures.
KLFM officials said it is possible they could set up a clearing house which
Kloffe could join later.
