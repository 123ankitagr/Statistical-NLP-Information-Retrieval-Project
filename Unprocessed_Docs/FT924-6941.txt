GERMANY, France and Portugal have sent delegations to Japanese companies to
promote their regions as attractive investment areas. At a time Japanese
manufacturers face sharp profit falls due to the economic slowdown, the
missions want to make their mark ahead of a business recovery.
Their efforts may undermine the UK as a first choice for Japanese
investment, since the Japanese have begun to look at continental Europe for
further investments, due to the large German and east European markets.
"We do not expect Japanese companies to rush into invest just after one
trip,' said Mr Christian Cambon, president of the business promotion agency
from Ile de France, the region which includes Paris.
Mr Cambon and said he and other 25 members were in Tokyo to remove the
negative image many Japanese hold of France. Comments last year by Mrs Edith
Cresson, then prime minister, that Japanese companies want 'to conquer the
world' and that Japan 'doesn't play fair' shocked many Japanese business
leaders. Some 195 Japanese manufacturers have set up operations in the UK,
with only 128 in France and 111 in Germany.
Mr Shigeyuki Onishi, deputy general manager of the Bank of Tokyo's corporate
advisory division, said many Japanese companies were looking to move the
centre of their European operations to continental Europe from the UK. 'More
Japanese companies are focusing on the huge potential of former east
European markets,' he said.
