Last week, the bund market was dispirited by the Bundesbank's decision to
leave short-term interest rates unchanged. This week, it is unlikely to take
cheer from two sets of data due in the next few days.
Baden-Wurttemberg and North-Rhine Westphalia, two of Germany's biggest
states, are expected to report inflation figures for January today or
tomorrow.
Other states report during the week and so it will be possible to get a
picture of German inflation for the month as a whole.
Last month pan-German inflation rose at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent.
Predictions for January range from 3.4 to 4 per cent, reflecting uncertainty
over the impact of higher indirect taxes on petrol.
A high outcome is likely to reinforce the Bundesbank's caution in bringing
the Lombard and discount rate down from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively
where they have been since the end of October.
The second item of data will be the December growth in M3 broad money
supply. The Bundesbank has warned that the figure will probably be high but
confirmation of this will do nothing to cheer investors in the bund market.
In November, M3 grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent, well above the
upper limit of last year's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range.
