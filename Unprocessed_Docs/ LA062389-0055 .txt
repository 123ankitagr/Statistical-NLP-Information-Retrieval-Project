Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, left the Soviet Union for home Thursday, ending an unprecedented 10-day visit. 
"I will long remember this visit. It was very fruitful," Crowe told the Tass news agency before leaving the country. 
Crowe, 64, was the first chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to make a working visit to the Soviet Union and travel around the country, visiting nine Soviet cities in 10 days. He also visited military facilities in Murmansk and Moscow and was received at military academies and the General Staff headquarters.
