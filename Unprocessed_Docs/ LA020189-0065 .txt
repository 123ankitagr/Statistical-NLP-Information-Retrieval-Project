Freshman applications to Stanford declined for the second year in a row, according to the school's Undergraduate Admissions Office. 
The office reported on Tuesday that frosh applications dropped about 6% this year to about 14,869. The school reported a similar decline in applicants a year ago. 
The office also said that among Stanford freshmen, the proportion applying to at least six other colleges doubled in the last five years, from 18% to 40%. 
Stanford admits students without regard to financial need, the office said.
