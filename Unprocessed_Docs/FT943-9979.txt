Cray Research of the US, the world's leading supercomputer manufacturer, has
for the first time won a Japanese public sector order in direct competition
with a Japanese computer company.
The sale, to the Japanese government-funded Tokyo Institute of Technology,
represents a breakthrough after more than a decade of trade disputes over US
allegations that Japan has discriminated against American manufacturers in
its public procurement of supercomputers.
It also comes as the US is preparing to impose trade sanctions on Japan
after failing to reach agreements on disputes over Japanese public
procurement policies in the telecommunications and medical equipment
sectors.
While the supercomputer purchase may be calculated to help defuse trade
tension, it could have the opposite effect by highlighting how long it has
taken Cray to break down the alleged barriers to Japanese government
purchases. Despite two US-Japanese agreements on supercomputer trade, in
1987 and 1990, and the formation of a supercomputer procurement review board
in Japan to ensure fair play, Cray has previously been unable to win sales
to Japanese government agencies and institutions except when there were no
bids from domestic competitors.
Moreover, it is not clear to what extent the sale to the Tokyo institute was
influenced by the depressed value of the dollar against the yen, which has
reduced the cost of US goods sold in Japan. Cray did not disclose the terms
of its sale agreement, but Japanese press reports said that the US-built
supercomputer was less than half the price of one offered by NEC, Cray's
largest Japanese competitor. Supercomputers typically cost Dollars
10m-Dollars 25m (Pounds 16m).
Cray will provide its C90 supercomputer to the institute for use as a host
computer at its information processing centre, the company said in Tokyo. It
is the first of 10 supercomputers to be bought by the Japanese government in
the current fiscal year.
