AN attempt to build a consensus among developing countries about the need to
reduce military expenditures failed yesterday, Stephen Fidler writes.
A meeting of finance ministers from the Group of 24 developing countries
dropped a reference to the issue from their communique for procedural
reasons. The Colombian chairmanship had introduced the item too late for
inclusion in the statement.
There has been growing pressure among industrialised nations for aid to
developing countries to be made conditional on low military spending. Mr
Rudolf Hommes, Colombia's finance minister, said high spending on arms
diverted resources away from poverty alleviation, health and other
development spending. Expenditures should be cut in both industrialised and
developing countries, he said.
The ministers expressed worries about the slowdown in growth in
industrialised countries and 'the worsening of the already unfavourable
external environment facing the developing countries.'
They also emphasised the need to keep up Third World representation in the
World Bank and IMF. There are concerns that new eastern European members of
the institution will further dilute the developing countries' influence on
the institutions.
