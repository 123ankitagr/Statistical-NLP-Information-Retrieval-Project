President Bush today gave all federal employees a half-day off on Monday, Christmas Eve. 
His order closes all federal departments and agencies early on Dec. 24, but allows department heads to require certain workers or offices to work a full day if needed "for reasons of national security or defense or for other essential public reasons." 
The order did not specify a quitting time, but most offices are likely to close around noon, local time. 
The order does not affect state or local government employees.
