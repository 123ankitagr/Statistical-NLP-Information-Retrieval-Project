A one-year building moratorium on Valley Boulevard has been extended again, allowing the city to halt new construction along the commercial strip until January, 1991. 
The extension would give city planners and a Valley Boulevard steering committee time to complete a specific plan, which will detail what percentage of an area should be devoted to certain uses and what types of projects -- hotels, restaurants, apartments -- the city wants developed.
