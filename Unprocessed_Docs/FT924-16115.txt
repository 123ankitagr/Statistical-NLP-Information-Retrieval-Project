SOUTH KOREAN President Roh Tae-woo left Beijing yesterday claiming that his
four-day state visit would help bring about Korean unification and improve
bilateral economic relations.
The visit - the first by a South Korean leader to China - did not produce
dramatic developments, but South Korean officials expressed satisfaction
that China signalled its willingness to assume the role of 'honest broker'
between the two Koreas.
China is the main ally of North Korea, but it decided to establish
diplomatic relations with Seoul in August. This reflected South Korea's
growing economic power and its possible role as a counterweight to Japanese
influence in the region.
Seoul claims that the forging of relations with Beijing has forced Pyongyang
to adopt a more conciliatory stance in inter-Korean negotiations.
It notes that unexpected progress was reached last month with North Korea on
implementing the reconciliation treaty, although the two remain divided on
the issue of nuclear facilities inspections.
Chinese officials warned Mr Roh that intense international pressure should
not be placed on Pyongyang concerning nuclear inspections.
They suggested that Pyongyang might soon make a concession on the issue.
Mr Roh and other South Korean officials have also recently hinted that North
Korea's suspected programme to build a nuclear weapon may have been
abandoned or suspended.
China favours the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and has refused
to provide nuclear technology to Pyongyang.
The establishment of Sino-South Korean relations was the final step in Mr
Roh's 'Nordpolitik' policy to forge ties with North Korea's closest allies,
which included the former Soviet bloc.
Beijing has been quietly persuading North Korea in recent years to adopt
some of the market measures taken in China. China and South Korea said the
benefits of their closer bilateral economic relations could be extended to
North Korea.
