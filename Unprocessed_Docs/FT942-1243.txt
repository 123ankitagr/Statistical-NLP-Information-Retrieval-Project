Taiwan has agreed to hold working-level talks with China next month in an
effort to 'promote cross-strait dialogue and rapprochement,' a senior
Taiwanese official said yesterday.
Mr Kao Koong-lien, vice-chairman of the Mainland Affairs Council, also
indicated Taipei's willingness to resume high-level meetings with Beijing,
but the timing and agenda remain unclear.
The move signalled a thaw in recent tensions sparked by the killings of
Taiwanese tourists in China's Zhejiang Province in late March. Ties plunged
to a seven-year nadir after the robbery-murder-arson attack on 24 tourists
aboard a pleasure boat on Qiandao Lake near the city of Hangzhou.
The two sides will discuss repatriation of illegal Chinese immigrants and
airline hijackers, fishing disputes and safety of Taiwanese travelling in
the mainland.
This would be the fifth round of administrative talks since the second half
of last year. Previous rounds have degenerated into squabbles over
sovereignty issues.
