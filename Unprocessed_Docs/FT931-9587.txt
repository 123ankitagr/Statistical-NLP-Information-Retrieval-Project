London and Manchester Group, the life insurance and financial services
company, yesterday announced it had acquired a car hire purchase company
which will allow it to expand its distribution network for insurance
products.
London and Manchester recently reduced its existing tied agency network to
weed out sales agents with low performance or poor persistency. As a result,
its new annual premium business has fallen in recent months.
The group said it paid Pounds 100,000 in cash for the subsidiary of
Provident Financial. Financing for the unit, whose auto loans portfolio is
valued at Pounds 26.3m, will be achieved through a Pounds 22.1m non-recourse
loan from Union Bank of Switzerland and Pounds 4.1m provided directly by
London and Manchester on a subordinated basis.
Mr Martin Jackson, group finance director, said that the new company will be
merged into Welcome Financial Services, London and Manchester's consumer
lending division, which also acts as a tied agent selling insurance products
to Welcome borrowers.
In recent years, some 25 per cent of Welcome's existing client base have
purchased other London and Manchester products from sales agents and it is
expected that the new car hire purchase customer base will provide a similar
level of cross-product selling, Mr Jackson said.
The new subsidiary has an existing client list of 14,000 who have purchased
used cars through dealers. Of these, 80 per cent live in areas serviced by
London and Manchester sales agents.
