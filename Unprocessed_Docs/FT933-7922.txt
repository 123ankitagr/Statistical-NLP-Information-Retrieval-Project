SOUTH KOREA has asked Israel to stop seeking an improvement in relations
with North Korea until suspicions over Pyongyang's nuclear programme are
resolved, writes John Burton.
The South Korean request followed a meeting between Israeli and North Korean
officials last week in Beijing.
Israel has held talks with North Korea to persuade it to stop supplying
Scud-C missiles to Syria and Iran. The tempo of contacts has increased
following North Korea's successful test firing in May of its Rodong-I
ballistic missile.
North Korea reportedly has agreed to sell the missile to Iran. The Rodong-I
could reach Israel from western Iran.
Pyongyang proposed last October that Israel purchase a North Korean gold
mine for Dollars 1bn, the amount of money it said it would lose if it
stopped selling missiles to Israel's enemies. Israel rejected that offer,
but the talks continue on other forms of economic co-operation.
