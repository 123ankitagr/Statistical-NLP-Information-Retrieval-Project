SHARES in Paramount Communications, which agreed to be acquired by Viacom
for Dollars 8.2bn last Sunday, rose sharply yesterday afternoon on reports
that Mr Ted Turner, chairman of Turner Broadcasting System, is considering a
rival bid for the group.
News agency reports said a board meeting of Turner Broadcasting had given Mr
Turner the green light to explore a rival offer for Paramount, best known
for Hollywood's Paramount Pictures film studios.
Shares in Paramount closed at Dollars 68 3/8 , up Dollars 3 5/8 , on the New
York Stock Exchange.
No comment was immediately available from Turner Broadcasting, but Mr Turner
is believed to have held informal talks with Paramount about a possible
link-up earlier this year.
Turner Broadcasting, best known for its CNN 24-hour news channel, recently
agreed to pay Dollars 600m to acquire two of Hollywood's few remaining
independent film studios, New Line Cinema and Castle Rock Entertainment.
Responding to yesterday's bid reports, a Paramount spokesman said: 'We
repeat what we have said from the first day: the merger with Viacom is a
perfect business fit, and is in the best interests of our shareholders. It
will be completed.'
QVC Network Inc, a fast-expanding home shopping cable business, is also
believed to be weighing a rival bid for Paramount.
