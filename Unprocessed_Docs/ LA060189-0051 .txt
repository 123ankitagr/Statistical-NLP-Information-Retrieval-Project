The Culver City Transportation Department will hold a public hearing on proposed Culver CityBus fare increases and route changes Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Veterans Memorial Auditorium, 4117 Overland Ave. 
Under the department's proposal, the basic 50-cent fare would be maintained, but the fare for seniors and the disabled would increase to 25 cents from 15 cents; the fare for elementary and secondary students would rise to 35 cents from 25 cents, and college students -- who now get a discount fare of 35 cents -- would pay the full rate. The cost of a transfer would rise to 25 cents from 10 cents. 
Proposed route changes include increasing the frequency on Line 1 (Washington Boulevard to the West Los Angeles Transit Center and Venice) from every 20 minutes to every 15 minutes. 
The cross-town Line 3, which goes from Westside Pavilion to the Fox Hills Mall, would be expanded during peak periods by keeping two buses in service for one hour longer. 
Line 6, which runs along Sepulveda Boulevard between Los Angeles International Airport and UCLA, would increase Saturday service frequency, and Sunday service would be added.
