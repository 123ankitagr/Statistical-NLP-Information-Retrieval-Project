Anderson Returns: Legendary actress Dame Judith Anderson, 93, returned to the stage Sunday night, giving an emotional and rare performance to benefit the 140-seat Ensemble Theatre in Santa Barbara. 
"I must say I'm always nervous before a performance, but especially tonight," said Anderson, who has made only rare stage appearances since retiring more than 20 years ago. "Here I thought I'd read a little 'Macbeth' and 'Hamlet' and it wouldn't be so bad. But oh, dear, it is." The Tony and Emmy award-winning actress performed for more than an hour. Shauna Snow
