Your in-depth report (on "Famous for Being Famous") failed to mention Angelique (I think that's her name) -- the Hollywood poster bimbo. 
I remember reading or hearing somewhere that she has a manager to make her famous. She's not an actress, not a major league ball player and doesn't endorse a product to my knowledge. But she's aspiring to be famous. 
What a country!
