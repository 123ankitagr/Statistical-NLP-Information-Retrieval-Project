Your editorial "Pets in the Wild?" (Feb. 23) about the problems wildlife in Yellowstone National Park are experiencing is right on. 
The area of the park boundaries enclose is not a complete ecosystem, and therein lies the problem. Until Congress acts to buy up and take over the surrounding private holdings and national forest lands the rancher-hunters will "harvest" every animal that moves over the park borders; nor will a natural balance of park wildlife be reestablished unless the predatory wolf is restored to Yellowstone. 
These days, we know that the wolf is not the big bad beast of the fairy tales and it is time Congress stopped believing these fairy tales.
