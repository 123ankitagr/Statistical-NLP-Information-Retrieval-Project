Sir, I offer some clarification to your article speculating on the possible
advancement of government negotiations for the development of commercial air
services between Taiwan and mainland China ('Business pulls Taiwan closer to
mainland', May 21).
Your naming of certain cities as possible destinations for new air routes
from Taiwan - Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, and Guangzhou - is conjecture, and
will remain so until such time that the political situation changes.
That EVA Air may serve these, or any other cities in mainland China, must
therefore be seen as speculative, and our decision would be made solely on
commercial grounds.
It is quite wrong, however, to suggest that EVA Air would transfer aircraft
from existing international scheduled services to develop new air services
between Taiwan and mainland China. Our international route development
remains central to our growth strategy.
It is untrue also to state the EVA Air's chairman, Mr Y F Yang, is 'an
avowed supporter' of Taiwan's Democratic Progressive party. He has never
been affiliated with any of our political parties.
Finally, your article began by stating that EVA Air will have five new
Boeing 747-400 aircraft before the end of this year. In fact, we shall have
seven.
