Blazes whipped by hot, dry winds have destroyed nearly 20,000 acres of forest and brushland in California, fire officials said. One of the worst of the fires, an 11,700-acre blaze about 45 miles northeast of Fresno in the central Sierra Nevada foothills, was nearly contained. The arson-caused fire destroyed seven houses and forced about 2,500 people from their homes for a time. A 5,700-acre wildfire in the Cleveland National Forest continued to burn out of control in a remote area of San Diego County. About 900 firefighters saved 13 homes and structures.
