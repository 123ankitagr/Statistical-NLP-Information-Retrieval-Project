Ready to invade: Massed ranks of cars at the Nissan plant in Sunderland.
The headache for European car producers like Peugeot is not January 1, but
the year 2000 when the EC is to end restrictions on Japanese car imports,
writes William Dawkins.
'Our real challenge is to get ready for the Japanese arrival,' says Mr
Tristan d'Albis, the former French diplomat who is external relations
director of Peugeot, Europe's third largest car producer.
Peugeot's chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, has won notoriety for his
denunciations of the EC's weakness in conceding to Japan without obtaining
equal market access in return.
Yet beneath the sound and fury, his company has been quietly improving its
productivity - by 50 per cent over the past five years - and renewing its
model line to face the Japanese onslaught which it expects in two years or
so.
January 1, however, did see the replacement of France's bilateral import
limit on Japanese cars, amounting to 3 per cent of the market, with an
annually negotiated EC-wide quota until 2000.
Mr d'Albis does not believe this will detonate an instant explosion in
Japanese car sales to Europe because Japanese manufacturers appear to be
restraining export volumes to protect margins during the recession.
In any any case, the old bilateral French-Japanese quota had become almost
redundant because it did not include sales from Japanese 'transplant'
factories in the UK, memorably condemned by Mr Calvet as a 'Japanese
aircraft carrier' off the coast of Europe.
