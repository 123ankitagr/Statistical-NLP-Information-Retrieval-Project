PRESIDENT Bill Clinton yesterday offered more sticks than carrots to North
Korea to persuade it to accept full nuclear inspections, as he ended his
visit to South Korea.
With US and North Korean officials preparing to hold discussions on the
nuclear issue in Geneva on Wednesday, Mr Clinton and Mr Warren Christopher,
the US secretary of state, reaffirmed that Pyongyang must fully comply with
international nuclear inspections or face UN sanctions.
'If we just stay strong and we stay resolute and we stay firm, we know that
will work,' said Mr Clinton as he toured the demilitarised zone that
separates North and South Korea. 'Eventually, we have to hope' that North
Korea will take the sensible course.'
'When you examine the nature of the American security commitment to Korea. .
. it is pointless for them to try to develop nuclear weapons because if they
ever use them it would be the end of their country.'
The president promised there would be no cuts in the number of US troops in
South Korea, now totalling 37,000, until the nuclear issue was resolved.
Mr Christopher said in a meeting with his South Korean counterpart that any
improvement in US-North Korean relations would depend on the progress in
inter-Korean ties, ruling out the possibility that Washington might
separately recognise Pyongyang in exchange for its full acceptance of
nuclear inspections.
The US has attached other conditions to better relations with North Korea,
including an improvement in human rights and renunciation of terrorism.
The US last month persuaded North Korea to suspend its withdrawal from the
nuclear non-proliferation treaty during high-level talks in New York.
Mr Christopher said Washington would not tolerate North Korea dragging its
feet endlessly during the new round of talks. If no appreciable progress was
achieved within a resonable period of time, the nuclear issue would be
referred to the UN Security Council for action.
