MR JACQUES Calvet, the combative chairman of Peugeot, created quite an
impact three weeks ago when he announced that he planned to run for French
president in 1995.
The timing was impeccable. Mr Calvet, a right-wing opponent of European
federalism, announced his ambitions just a few days before the Danish vote
against European federalism.
Mr Calvet's stock in trade is to argue for a strong Europe able to defend
its member states' interests, to attack the European Commission, and to warn
of unfair Japanese trade practices.
An outstanding member of the business elite, Mr Calvet, 61, started his
career as senior adviser to former president Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing,
when the latter was finance minister from 1970 to 1974. He moved on to
Banque Nationale de Paris, the leading state-owned bank, becoming chairman
before being kicked out by the Socialists in 1981.
Mr Calvet joined Peugeot a year later, at the invitation of its family
shareholders, and instituted a tough programme of cost cutting. As a result,
Peugeot last year published the best net margins in the world car industry.
