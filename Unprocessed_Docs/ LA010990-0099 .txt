An alleged Nazi war criminal who fled the United States to avoid possible deportation to the Soviet Union will go on trial in West Germany later this month, authorities said Monday. 
Boleslav Maikovskis, 86, a Latvian, will go on trial Jan. 18 charged with murder and complicity in the shooting deaths of 170 villagers in Audrine, Latvia, during World War II, according to a statement by the state court in Muenster. 
Maikovskis, a former resident of Mineola, N.Y., fled the United States in 1987.
