John Swan & Sons, the Scottish livestock auctioneer and estate agent, was
hit by bad debts in the half year ended October 31 1992, but held on to its
profit.
The directors said what should have been the most successful six month
period of trading for the company had been marred by the necessity to
provide for potential debts of Pounds 98,000.
As a result, from turnover increased by 18 per cent to Pounds 762,600
(Pounds 646,300) the pre-tax profit was a little behind at Pounds 162,700
(Pounds 166,800). Earnings per share came to 18.2p (18.6p).
