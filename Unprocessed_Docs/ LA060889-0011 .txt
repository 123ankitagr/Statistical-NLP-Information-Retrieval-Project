The great wave of democracy rising now in the world is due in some large measure to the fact that in recent years murder has become unfashionable and unrewarding among many totalitarian butchers. If the Chinese Communists can prevail because they slaughtered their adversaries, they will have reinstated murder as a form of politics. And the word will go forth: Murder works; it is an acceptable policy tool to scare off the opposition. 
If China is turned around and is forced to forswear violence, we can enter an era where the preeminent human command can also apply to governments: Thou shalt not kill. When thou can't kill, it's a lot harder for thou to oppress.
