The engineering department of Aetna Life & Casualty has created a free home inspection guide, "Before a House Becomes a Home." 
The booklet tells home buyers what to look for when they're looking over a prospective house -- and when to have the house inspected by a professional. 
Some hints: Check exterior of the house for wood rot; check for missing shingles on the roof; look for cracks and water stains in the ceilings and walls that may indicate leaking plumbing fixtures or a leaky roof. 
For a copy of the booklet, write: Aetna Life & Casualty, Resources RWAC, 151 Farmington Ave., Hartford, Conn. 06156.
