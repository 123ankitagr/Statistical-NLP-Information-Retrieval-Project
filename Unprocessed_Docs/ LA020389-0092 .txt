"The Iron Triangle" (Westside Pavilion) is an entirely decent effort to view the Vietnam War through the eyes of a young Viet Cong guerrilla as well as those of a veteran American captain. For all its sincerity and despite the effectiveness of newcomer Liem Whatley and Beau Bridges, it is a grueling and tedious business, not that much different from any routine and bloody B war picture. Somehow, too, the notion that the enemy can be a guy not so different from us comes as scarcely an astounding revelation. 
Adapted from an actual Viet Cong soldier's diary by director Eric Weston and co-writers John Bushelman and Larry Hilbrand, the film takes its title from a region northwest of Saigon at the base of the Ho Chi Minh infiltration route where the highest number of enemy troops was concentrated. Although only 17, Ho (Whatley) is a seasoned and resourceful soldier, idealistic and dedicated yet not reveling in bloodshed, an attitude that riles a zealous, thick-headed Communist Party official (James Ishida). Bridges is a capable leader, patriotic without being consumed by hatred for the enemy. At one point Bridges' Capt. Keene spares Ho's life. What is Ho to do now that he has captured Keene? Unfortunately, the question proves not to be as trenchant or suspenseful as one would wish. 
Complementing Whatley and Bridges' solid performances are those of Johnny Hallyday as a cynical French mercenary and veteran of Dien Ben Phu and Haing Ngor as Ho's level-headed commander, a man not unlike Keene. "The Iron Triangle" (rated R for standard war movie violence), which was filmed in Sri Lanka, is high-minded but not nearly distinctive enough to be involving.KEVIN THOMAS
