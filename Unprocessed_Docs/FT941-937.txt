The government has criticised the European Commission's green paper on
social policy.  It said many of the themes should be left to member states.
The government attacked the green paper for suggesting that 'levels of
social provision and regulation can only ever increase' and for supporting
'merchanistic approaches to labour market intervention'.
The government wants discussion on how far EU social policy impedes UK
competitiveness and how far it protects member states with high levels of
social protection.
The paper could form the basis of a new programme of social legislation.
