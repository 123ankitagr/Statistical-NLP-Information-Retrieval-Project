Fiat and Peugeot Citroen yesterday unveiled a new range of jointly-developed
vehicles in which they have invested some Dollars 1.5bn. They intend to
capture a larger share of the European van market and attack, for the first
time, Europe's rapidly-growing multi-passenger vehicle (MPV) sector.
The new vehicle ranges have involved an investment of L1,234bn (Dollars
725m) at the Sevel vans joint venture plant, which first came on stream at
Val di Sangro in Italy's Mezzogiorno 13 years ago, and FFr6.04bn in Sevel
Nord, a new facility to build the MPV, near Valenciennes, which will employ
3,200 people.
Sevel was set up in 1978 with Fiat holding a 50 per cent share and PSA 50
per cent through its Peugeot and Citroen subsidiaries.
The projects have a combined production capacity of 320,000 units a year, of
which 130,000 is for the MPV. The 190,000 annual capacity at the vans plant
represents an increase to 800 units a day from the 550-a-day capacity limit
for the old van models.
The latest Sevel projects represent one of the most complex and extensive
collaborative projects to be undertaken between two European vehicle makers.
The van ranges alone were said at yesterday's launch to have 30 different
body configurations, with three wheelbases and three vehicle heights. As
with the original Sevel project, they will be marketed under Fiat, Peugeot
and Citroen badges - as the Ducato, Boxer and Jumper respectively, except in
the UK where the Citroen version will be known as the Relay.
The MPV is to be sold under the Lancia as well as Fiat, Peugeot and Citroen
badges, although names are not being revealed until the vehicles' launch in
the spring.
The new MPV is entering one of the few European vehicle market sectors to
enjoy growth last year.
