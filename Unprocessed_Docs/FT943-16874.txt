There was more late drama in the Enterprise Oil/Lasmo takeover battle, with
both camps claiming confidence of success. Significantly, Lasmo shares came
under heavy selling pressure, closing 8 1/2 off at 134 1/2 p on big turnover
of 9.5m, with US investors selling the stock aggressively. Enterprise shares
moved up 7 to 389p.
But contrary to the view that the slide in Lasmo indicated that the bid
would fail, some dealers said US holders were taking the view that an
Enterprise victory was likely. US investors, unwilling to accept the new
Enterprise paper, preferred to sell their shares for cash in the market.
Sector specialists said the bid, the outcome of which is expected minutes
after the market closes today, was still on a knife-edge last night. One
view was that Enterprise had made a tactical blunder in buying half of the
16 per cent held by Philips & Drew Fund Management.
Analysts said that, since PDFM was expected to accept the bid in any event,
Enterprise would have done better to have bid elsewhere for the 10 per cent
stake it sought.
