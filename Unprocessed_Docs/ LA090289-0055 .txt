Medicare will pay for routine mammography tests to detect breast cancer beginning Jan. 1, under a regulation the government proposed Friday. 
Congress authorized Medicare coverage of mammography examinations last year, making an exception to the law that prohibits Medicare payments for routine physical checkups. 
One of every 10 women will develop breast cancer in their lifetimes, medical experts say, and elderly women have the highest risk. 
"Early detection of breast cancer is essential for effective treatment, and Medicare coverage will encourage more older women to obtain mammography screening on a regular basis," said Louis W. Sullivan, secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. 
The regulation, drafted by HHS, was published in Friday's Federal Register. After 60 days of public comment, a final regulation will be drafted.
