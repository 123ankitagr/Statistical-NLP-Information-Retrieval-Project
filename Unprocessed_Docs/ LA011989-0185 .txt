A $73-million, high-technology traffic-management system is designed to reduce San Diego County freeway congestion by 30% by the year 2005, Caltrans officials announced Wednesday. The plan -- a combined effort of Caltrans, the San Diego Assn. of Governments and the California Highway Patrol -- will incorporate several high-tech projects that were approved in a 1988 State Transportation Improvement Plan, said Steve Saville of Caltrans. The project will feature a traffic control center at the Caltrans office on Juan Street, a communications network, special devices to detect traffic congestion, 170 additional ramp meters, 36 closed-circuit TV, 14 message signs, traffic advisory radio stations for motorists and three motorist service response teams. The project will cover 211 miles of Interstate 5, Interstate 8 and California 94.
