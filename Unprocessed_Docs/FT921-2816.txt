ONE CROATIAN soldier was reported killed yesterday in eastern Croatia as
United Nations reconnaissance forces searched for barracks to house the
14,000-strong peacekeeping force due to arrive next month. Croatian radio
also reported sporadic shooting in central and eastern Croatia.
Meanwhile, across the border in northern Bosnia, Belgrade radio said
Bosanski Brod, a mixed town of mostly Serbs and Croats, was calm yesterday
after a night of heavy mortar and gun battles.
Belgrade radio said European Community-sponsored talks on the future of
Bosnia-Hercegovina among the Slavic Moslem, Serb and Croat leaders appeared
to be floundering. Diplomats fear the outbreak of civil war among the three
main ethnic groups in the central republic.
The inhabitants of Mostar, western Bosnia, yesterday remained in a tense
situation as town officials tried to persuade Serbs and Moslems to take down
barricades.
