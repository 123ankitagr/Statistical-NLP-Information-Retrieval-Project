How appropriate that the house where the gunpowder plot was organised comes
to market today, 389 years after Guy Fawkes tried to blow up King James I.
The house is at Ashby St Ledgers in Northamptonshire, and belonged to the
Catesby family. Robert Catesby, a stout Roman Catholic, held the planning
meeting in the gatehouse, tradition says.
When the plot failed, Catesby and the other conspirators rushed the 80 miles
from London to Ashby St Ledgers.
Much of the present house is the work of Sir Edwin Lutyens, albeit working
in a 17th century mode; but Catesby's house survives with fine 17th century
panelling, as does the half-timbered gatehouse.
Lutyens also designed the gardens which include a canal garden, statue
garden, temple and an early 20th century version of a packhorse bridge.
This imposing house with 32 acres has 10 bedrooms and numerous outbuildings.
The price from Lane Fox (01295-273592) is Pounds 2m.
