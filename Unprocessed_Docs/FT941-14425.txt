Tops Estates has paid Pounds 14m for two Lancashire shopping centres.
Consideration for the shopping centres - 3 1/2 acres at Ashton-Under-Lyne
and 2 acres at Bamber Bridge, Preston - was settled in cash out of resources
and available bank facilities.
The company said that the two additions to the investment portfolio, which
have a combined rent roll of more than Pounds 1.4m (with 10 rent reviews
presently outstanding), offered an 'outstanding opportunity for substantial
growth'.
