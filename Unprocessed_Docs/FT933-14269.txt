Michael Davies, deputy chairman of TI and a director of British Airways, is
taking over as non-executive chairman of Simon Engineering. Sir Philip
Foreman, who has turned 70, had been serving as interim chairman for the
past three months following the sudden death of the previous chairman Roy
Roberts. He stays on as deputy chairman.
Simon has been hard hit by the recession. At the annual meeting in May, Sir
Philip forecast a loss for the first half of this year and revealed the
company would then be in breach of one of its banking covenants, which
knocked 25 per cent off the value of the shares in a day.
Davies, who would not be drawn on how he will help restore the flagging
fortunes of 'one of the UK's longest established engineering companies' said
that his arrival 'did not necessarily mean anything' as regards the position
of chief executive Brian Kemp, who joined in 1989.
Davies, 59, admits he has recently been spending a good deal of his time at
BA, where all the non-executive directors have been drawn in to the
wranglings over the Virgin 'dirty tricks' affair. But he is adamant that he
has time for another post in addition to the four other chairmanships,
including that of Calor, which he maintains on top of the BA and TI
commitments. 'I enjoy business,' he says, adding only that 'over time I do
change my portfolio'. Those changes are, however, not likely to include BA
in the near future, as this week he was re-elected to the board, on which he
has sat since 1983.
