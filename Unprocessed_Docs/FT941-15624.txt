France will continue to supply Taiwan with 'non-offensive' military
equipment, as well as with spare parts for Mirage jets and frigates already
contracted for, Mr Francois Leotard, French defence minister, said
yesterday.
Following the Paris-Beijing announcement that French companies would sign no
new arms contracts with Taiwan, as the price of normalising French relations
with China, Taiwanese officials were reported to be worried about the
long-term supply of spare parts for French Mirages and frigates due to be
delivered from 1995-6.
France's new policy means French companies will now drop out of contention
for the FFr20bn (Pounds 2.26bn) Taiwanese tender for submarines because
these were clearly 'offensive weapons', a senior defence ministry official
said yesterday. But French companies could still supply Taiwan with such as
air defence gear and light armoured vehicles.
