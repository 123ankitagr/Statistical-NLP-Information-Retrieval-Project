The US Customs Service yesterday threatened a crackdown on Taiwanese sweater
makers and American importers who may be trying to avoid high US dumping
duties, writes Nancy Dunne in Washington.
Investigators have concluded that about 1.4m Taiwanese sweaters have been
misidentified as the products of other manufacturers who pay lower dumping
duties. The duties range from 4 to 24 per cent. Customs is continuing its
investigation to identify the actual manufacturers of the mislabelled
sweaters.
