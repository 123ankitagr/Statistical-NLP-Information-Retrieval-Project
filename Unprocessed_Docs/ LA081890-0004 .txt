The National Science Foundation chose Florida State University over the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to establish a laboratory for high-magnetic field research. 
The grant could be worth up to $60 million over five years. "Florida State University, while not having on board at present the scientists of the quality of those at MIT, was clearly committed to creating a national center of excellence," David A. Sanchez, an assistant director of the foundation, said. Research related to production and use of magnetic fields can lead to new devices for the computer industry, new materials with exceptional strengths and major advances in medicine.
