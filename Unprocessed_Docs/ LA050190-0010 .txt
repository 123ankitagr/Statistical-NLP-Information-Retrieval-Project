Agriculture officials announced Monday the discovery of a Mediterranean fruit fly in a Downey neighborhood that has been repeatedly sprayed with malathion. 
The fly was trapped in a lemon tree in the 8000 block of Borson Street. 
A rash of Medflies have been discovered over the past month in areas bordering or just outside treatment areas. The number of finds has been distressing for officials, but they have maintained that the lack of fly discoveries within a malathion treatment area shows that the spraying has worked. The Downey fly was found one mile inside a spray zone. 
That area is scheduled for a 10th aerial spraying of malathion tonight. 
No decision has been made on what action will be taken in response to the new find. 
Currently, more than 400 square miles in 18 treatment zones across Southern California have been sprayed with malathion in the effort to wipe out the crop-destroying pest.
