Ginny Joyce on Tuesday became the city's first female mayor. 
She was unanimously selected for the post by fellow City Council members during the council's annual reorganization. 
John Van Doren was chosen to be mayor pro tem. 
Joyce, 52, was elected to the council in November, 1988, and was chosen mayor pro tem in November, 1989. 
She said that her selection is symbolic of the advances women are making in politics and that she is excited to be the first female mayor in Duarte. 
Each year, council members select a mayor from among their ranks to serve a one-year term.
