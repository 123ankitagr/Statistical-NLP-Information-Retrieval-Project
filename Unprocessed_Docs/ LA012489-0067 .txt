The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Anchorage announced a $2,500 reward for help in catching those responsible for recent killings of bald eagles. Federal wildlife agents have a dozen carcasses and believe many more of the big birds may have been gunned down in the unexplained rash of killings this winter, agency spokesman Bruce Batten said. The bald eagle, America's national symbol, is endangered or threatened everywhere except in Alaska.
