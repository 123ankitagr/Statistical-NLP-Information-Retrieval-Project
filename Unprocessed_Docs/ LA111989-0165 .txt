Washington's Huskies overcame three intercepted passes and a lost fumble by quarterback Cary Conklin to beat Washington State, 20-9, Saturday in their annual Apple Cup rivalry to earn a trip to the Freedom Bowl. 
After the game, jubilant Washington students overwhelmed security police and tore down the goal post on the west end of Husky Stadium and threw it in nearby Lake Washington. 
Police sprayed tear gas on several students and scuffled and wrestled with others on the field. Some students pelted police with ice kept from behind the Washington bench. 
In the game, the Huskies' offense managed only one touchdown, a 21-yard run by Greg Lewis with eight seconds left in the third quarter, but their defense did an outstanding job against WSU quarterback Brad Gossen and Cougar star running back Steve Broussard. Washington sacked Gossen eight times for losses of 41 yards and also intercepted two of his passes. 
Eric Briscoe intercepted a Gossen pass and returned it 35 yards for a touchdown on the first offensive play of the game. 
By winning the Pac-10 game, Washington (7-4) moved in line for its 10th bowl invitation in 11 years. The formal invitation is expected next week. Washington State dropped to 6-5.
