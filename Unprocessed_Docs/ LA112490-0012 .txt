Thousand Oaks City Council members will say goodby to two council members at a special ceremony Tuesday at City Hall. 
Four-term Councilman Lawrence E. Horner and one-term Councilman Tony Lamb will turn their seats over to newly elected Councilwomen Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah. 
The last time the council included a woman was in 1986, when Madge L. Schaefer was elected to the Ventura County Board of Supervisors. 
In addition to welcoming the new councilwomen, members will choose a new mayor and mayor pro tem. 
Mayor Alex Fiore, the top vote-getter in his reelection bid, will step down and a new mayor will be named by the five-member council. 
Mayor Pro Tem Frank Schillo is expected to be named to the one-year position. Schillo, 56, served as mayor in 1986-87. 
Horner said he was not saddened that his 16-year tenure on the council is ending. 
He plans to devote most of his time to work and other activities. 
He is a vice president at Northrop Corp., which recently announced plans to close its plant in Newbury Park at the end of 1991. 
Lamb, a retired inventor, did not seek reelection. PSYCHE PASCUAL
