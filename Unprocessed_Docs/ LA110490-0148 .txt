With regard to your editorial ("Change in the Offing," Oct. 26), I would like to give you some missing information about Hope Logan, a candidate for Board of Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges. 
Her opponent, Denise Moreno Ducheny, appears to be promoted by you partially for "the kind of fire needed on this board." 
Others, as you state, see her style as confrontational. A confrontational style, in my experience, is simply ineffective. 
On the other hand, Hope Logan, a former professor at San Diego State University, has been remarkably effective on boards from which she has gained vast experience. Your editorial states: "Either woman would make an exemplary trustee." 
As I have sat on a board of directors and on several committees with Logan, I have seen her in action. Hope Logan is impressive in her determination to solve problems. She is a powerful negotiator and communicator. Her reasons are backed by factual data. Hope Logan is persuasive in her dialogues. Her successful community service record is an indication of her superb leadership ability. 
San Diego is fortunate to have such a caring and capable candidate as Hope Logan for the Board of Trustees of the San Diego Community Colleges.
