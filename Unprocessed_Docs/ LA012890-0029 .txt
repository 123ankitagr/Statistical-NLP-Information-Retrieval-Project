I have been involved in lesbian theater in L.A. as an actor and producer since 1986 and I can't figure out on what basis Loynd describes lesbian drama as "most often dealing with loneliness, jealousies and fears." Some plays that do not fit that category are L.S. Elliot's farce "Met My Match," Sarah Dreher's "Alumnae News" and Bia Lowe's "All About Betty," all enjoying successful runs in L.A. 
Lesbians wouldn't have to "claw for recognition" if members of the white, male press (such as Mr. Loynd) did their homework. I mean, how many lesbians did Loynd poll to determine that we are "satisfied with our gay sisterhood forum"? I would disagree with that statement if I knew what it meant.
