TELE-COMMUNICATIONS, the biggest operator of US cable television systems,
yesterday offered to acquire the remaining 46 per cent of United Artists
Entertainment it does not own in a deal valued at more than Dollars 1bn.
United Artists Entertainment, a cable television and cinema group formed in
1989 when United Artists merged with United Cable Television in a Dollars
1.3bn deal, said the acquisition would be structured as a tax-free merger.
United Artists' common shares would be exchanged for class A common shares
of Tele-Communications, and United Artists' outstanding preferred stock
would be converted into comparable preferred stock to be issued by
Tele-Communications.
United Artists' outstanding common stock would be converted into 0.95 of a
share of Tele-Communications class A.
Tele-Communications also plans to begin a Dollars 4 3/4 cash tender offer
for each outstanding right issued at the time of the merger between United
Artists and United Cable. Tele-Communications acquired its controlling stake
in United Artists in 1986.
United Artists A shares added Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 14 3/4 while
Tele-Communications A issues closed Dollars  1/4 lower at Dollars 15 3/4 .
Mr Edward Hatch, an analyst at Nomura Research Institute, described the move
as a pre-emptive measure by Tele-Communications to acquire the remainder of
UAE before its share price moves much higher.
