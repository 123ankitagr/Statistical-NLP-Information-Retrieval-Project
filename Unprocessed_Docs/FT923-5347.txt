GEORGIA accused Russian forces of killing several of its soldiers in a
missile attack in the Black Sea region of Abkhazia yesterday, but Moscow
angrily dismissed the charge, Reuter reports from Moscow.
Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, the Georgian leader, said army commanders had told
him several Georgians had been killed by Russian fire while crossing a river
near the Abkhazian capital, Sukhumi. News agencies quoted him as telling the
governing State Council that rockets had been fired from a Russian Defence
Ministry laboratory.
The number of dead was not confirmed.
Moscow quickly denied the accusations as a 'fabrication'. A spokesman told
Moscow Radio that some Russian army facilities were being 'systematically
shelled by Georgian formations' but the troops were remaining neutral.
Mr Shevardnadze said the incident could jeopardise talks with President
Boris Yeltsin tomorrow aimed at seeking an end to fighting between Georgian
forces and Abkhazian separatists in the unstable Black Sea region.
The former Soviet foreign minister said he had immediately telephoned Mr
Yeltsin to seek an explanation. 'Yeltsin assured me he could officially
declare that no order had been given for Russian troops to interfere in this
conflict,' Mr Shevardnadze said.
