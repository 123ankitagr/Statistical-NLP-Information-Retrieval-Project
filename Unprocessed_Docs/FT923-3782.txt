The executive directors of Harmony Leisure Group, including the founder Mr
Stanley Lever, a former director of Forte, face a challenge from an
alternative management quartet.
The four, who own no shares in the loss-making USM-quoted company which runs
restaurants and public houses, have written to shareholders suggesting that
they call for an extraordinary meeting to remove Harmony's executive
directors.
The challengers include Mr Andrew Martyr, who says he has 20 years'
experience in hotel and leisure operations management, and Mr Simon Lynch,
formerly with Grand Metropolitan.
By coincidence, Harmony's non-executive chairman Sir Stanley Grinstead is a
former chairman of GrandMet.
