Beverly Hills Unified School District's four elementary schools have been named 1988-89 California Distinguished Schools, the state's highest public award to recognize educational excellence. 
The schools, among the 233 winners announced recently by state Supt. William Honig, were selected on the basis of rank or improvement on the California Assessment Program tests for the third, sixth and eighth grades. 
The schools -- Beverly Vista, El Rodeo, Hawthorne and Horace Mann -- received the award for top performance in all categories.
