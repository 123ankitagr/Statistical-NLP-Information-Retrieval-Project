It seems to me that it would be more pertinent for General Motors to spend $500 million on improving the quality of GM products than on advertising with NBC ("GM, NBC Sign Big, Long-Term Advertising Pact," May 1). Doing so could increase employment in the industry and increase their sales automatically. 
We really don't need more advertising gimmicks but rather better U.S.-made automobiles.
