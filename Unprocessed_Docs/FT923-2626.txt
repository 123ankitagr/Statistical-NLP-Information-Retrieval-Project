THE New Zealand Court of Appeal yesterday cleared the way for Carter Holt
Harvey (CHH), the New Zealand forestry group, to sell Sealord Products, its
fishing subsidiary, to a consortium led by Greenland Ocean Trawlers of
Denmark.
The court threw out a legal challenge that would have stopped the company
selling 40 per cent of its shares overseas. Southern Ocean Trawlers, a rival
New Zealand fishing group, had argued that Sealord should not be allowed to
have more than 25 per cent foreign ownership to retain its fishing quotas
under the country's Fisheries Act.
CHH has received two bids for Sealord:
One from the Danish-led consortium which includes Ord Minnett, an investment
bank which is part of Westpac, the Australian banking group. It plans to
float about 25 per cent of Sealord in New Zealand.
The other bidder is a joint venture between Brierley Investments, the New
Zealand investment group, and Maori tribal interests which will receive
NZDollars 190m (USDollars 105m) government support. This group also intends
to float some of Sealord's shares.
CHH's plans to sell Sealord, believed to be worth Dollars 390m, have been
delayed for months because of the court action.
