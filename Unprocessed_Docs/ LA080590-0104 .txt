Members of the imperial court have buried rice, salt, linen and silk in a ground-breaking ceremony preparing a site for Emperor Akihito's coronation next fall. 
Akihito, 56, became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his father, Emperor Hirohito. The coronation was delayed by a yearlong mourning period.
