Baring Securities has forecast that the remainder of 1994 and 1995 should
see an upturn in emerging markets with institutional funds being switched
from south-east Asia to Latin America, Reuter reports.
Barings remarked that the main propellant of emerging markets strategy was
the US economy. If US growth was slow bonds were likely to rally, providing
an incentive to invest in south-east Asia. 'But with a strong US economy
Latin America historically performs better, pushed along by pressure on
commodity prices,' said Barings. A mediocre performance from the US economy,
however, should drive funds to Japan and north-east Asia.
