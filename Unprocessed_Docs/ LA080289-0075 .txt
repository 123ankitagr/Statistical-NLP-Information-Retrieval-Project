A South Korean dissident student has fallen into a coma as she continued a fast demanding safe passage through the demilitarized zone across the Korean Peninsula on her way home, the North Korean news agency reported. Im Su Kyong, a 20-year-old student from Hankuk University in Seoul, was placed under intensive medical care in the fast she began Thursday, the Korean Central News Agency reported from the truce village of Panmunjom. Im traveled to North Korea via Japan and West Germany to attend an international youth festival in Pyongyang on July 1-8, defying a South Korean government warning. U.S. and South Korean authorities have refused to let her travel through the demilitarized zone.
