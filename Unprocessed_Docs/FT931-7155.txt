Freight traffic at Dubai's two ports, Rashid and Jebel Ali, rose by 18 per
cent in 1992 to 1.48m containers, writes Mark Nicholson in Cairo.
Traffic was buoyed by a big rise in electronics re-exports to former
republics of the Soviet Union. The emirate's older Port Rashid handled some
800,000 containers and Jebel Ali the remainder.
