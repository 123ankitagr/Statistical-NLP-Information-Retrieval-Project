Up to 20 Japanese bank lenders to Euro Disney yesterday wrote to the joint
bank steering committee stating objections to an outline restructuring of
the theme park's FFr21bn (Dollars 3.6bn) of debt, a senior banker said,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The banks have been told by their head offices they cannot approve the deal
in its present form, said the banker, who asked not to be named.
A senior executive on the steering committee said: 'This is the inevitable
two-way dialogue of a complex restructuring.'
