Country properties: Country Host Registry is a reservations service representing 21 farms, ranches and rural homes that offer bed and breakfast-style lodging along with a taste of country life. All properties except one are in Oregon and range from working sheep farms in southern Oregon's Douglas County to secluded country homes near Portland. 
The only outside-Oregon property is a riverside homestead in White Salmon, Wash., in the Columbia River Gorge. Guest season varies from property to property. Some offer year-round lodging. Others are open to guests only in the summer season. 
Prices: Rates, with breakfast, range from about $45 to $95 per day for two; $5 less for singles. Some hosts provide lunch and/or dinner. Adult prices for extra meals are $5 a person for lunch and $12.50 for dinner; $3.50 and $4.50 for children under 12. Host families' names, addresses and driving directions are provided when reservations are confirmed. Payment in full to Country Host Registry is required with reservation requests. Drop-in traffic is not accepted. 
Restrictions: Most member properties accept children, but, in some cases, not small children. A few accept pets. "Restricted smoking" is the general rule, but there are exceptions. Because of insurance liability, not all hosts allow visitors to take part in farm chores. Each property sets its own policies.
