The senior debt rating of JP Morgan, the US commercial bank, faces a
possible downgrade by Moody's, the US credit rating agency, in a move that
highlights a growing divergence of views about the bank among rating
agencies, writes Richard Waters in New York.
Moody's alreadys accords JP Morgan a lower rating, at AA1, than rival US
rating agency Standard & Poor's, which earlier this year affirmed its own
top AAA rating for the bank.
Moody's said it would review JP Morgan's position in the investment banking
business, where it has been expanding. In light of strong competition and a
difficult regulatory background, the bank 'faces challenges in establishing
itself as the pre-eminent provider of investment banking services', Moody's
said.
Morgan attacked the decision, saying that its earnings in the first nine
months were the second-highest on record and that its capital ratios had
never been stronger.
