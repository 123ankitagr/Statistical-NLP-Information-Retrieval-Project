MR ERIK PENSER, the Swedish financier, yesterday filed a SKr3.8bn (Dollars
657m) lawsuit against Nordbanken, claiming the Swedish state-owned bank last
year illegally seized his majority shareholding in Nobel Industries, the
chemicals and defence group.
'The circumstances surrounding the seizure of the Nobel shares were not
consistent with valid legal procedures,' said Mr Bjorn Edgren, an attorney
for Mr Penser, in filing the suit for damages.
Nordbanken took over Mr Penser's holdings after he suffered a liquidity
squeeze last August. Mr Penser has said he was forced to give up control of
Nobel for a symbolic SKr1 because Nordbanken threatened him with
insol-vency.
The suit comes a week after an independent investigator appointed by Nobel
concluded that Nordbanken and other banks pressured it into helping them
rescue the finance subsidiary, Gamlestaden.
An agreement by Nobel to provide a SKr2.3bn capital contribution to
Gamlestaden was described as invalid due to the pressure applied by the
banks on Nobel, according to the investigation.
