TAIWAN and Australia signed two pacts yesterday to promote investment and
technology transfer, the Economics Ministry said, Reuter reports from
Taipei. The agreements between the Australia Commerce and Industry Office
and two Taiwanese government agencies strengthen legal protection for
Australian trademarks in Taiwan, the island's Vice Economics Minister, Hsu
Ke-sheng, said.
They also allow investors from Australia and Taiwan to receive the full
protection of laws in the host country, and to receive assistance from local
investment institutions, Mr Hsu said in a statement. 'This is the first time
that (Taiwan) has signed an agreement on the protection of industrial
property with a foreign country on an equal and mutually beneficial basis,'
he said.
Australia and Taiwan do not have diplomatic relations because Canberra
switched recognition to China in 1972.
But Australian investment in Taiwan totals about USDollars 156m (Pounds
105m) and recorded Taiwanese investment in Australia is about Dollars 17m,
according to Taiwan.
