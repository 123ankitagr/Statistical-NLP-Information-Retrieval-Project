Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in a personal message Sunday that he wants to make an official visit to Britain as soon as possible, Thatcher's office said. 
The message was delivered by Soviet Ambassador Leonid M. Zamyatin, who saw the prime minister on his return from a trip to Moscow for a Central Committee meeting. 
"Mr. Gorbachev confirmed his desire to pay an official visit to Britain and said dates should be agreed as soon as possible," a spokeswoman at Thatcher's office said. 
"Mrs. Thatcher said that Mr. Gorbachev was welcome whenever he chose to come to Britain," the spokeswoman added. 
Gorbachev had been scheduled to visit Britain a month ago but had to cancel the trip at the last minute when an earthquake devastated Soviet Armenia on Dec. 7. 
He cut short his visit to the United States and returned to Moscow, postponing visits to Britain and Cuba.
