The second phase of the $28-million McKellar Office Park in Anaheim was completed in May. Located on a hilltop site, the three-story, 60,000-square-foot office building features a glass and brick exterior with an atrium entry. The first phase of the project, a 40,000-square-foot building, is 100% leased, and a third building, identical to the second, will complete the office park.
