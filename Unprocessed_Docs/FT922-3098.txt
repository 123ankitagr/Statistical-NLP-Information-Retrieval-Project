MEMBERS OF the Association of Natural Rubber Producing Countries members,
who are meeting here next week, appear willing to shelve ideas for a
producer cartel and explore the possibilities of an open market, a local
commodity exchange official said yesterday, reports Reuter from Singapore.
'A new mood seems to be prevailing, I think. There is a willingness among
producers to give the open market a chance, to explore ways to find a better
price through open trade,' said Mr Quek Kar Tung, general manager of
Singapore's RAS Commodity Exchange.
Rubber producers, frustrated by an extended period of low prices, have been
considering ways to boost prices. One idea recently mooted was a producers'
cartel to restrain supply.
The producers' association, formed in 1970, groups India, Indonesia,
Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Singapore, which account
for the bulk of the world's natural rubber output.
