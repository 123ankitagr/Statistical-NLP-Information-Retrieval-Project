A 10-year-old blind boy will get to fulfill his dream of being a disc jockey Wednesday. 
Joe Milam of High Point, N.C., will co-host the morning show on station WMAG with regular Bill Flynn, an appearance arranged after Flynn heard about how Joe put on a make-believe radio show at home. "I was touched by Joe's story and remembered how I used to pretend to do a radio show by faking it at home," Flynn said. "Now I just fake it at work." The station plans to let Joe run free by playing records, doing interviews and introducing the weather.
