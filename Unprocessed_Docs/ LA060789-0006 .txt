It is ironic that Capt. Will C. Rogers III has been awarded a top military honor (Part I, May 28) for his command of the guided-missile cruiser Vincennes, which became the focus of international controversy last July when it mistakenly shot down an Iranian airliner in the Persian Gulf, killing all 290 people aboard. 
What is the rationale for such a public display by the Navy? Could this event not have taken place at a private ceremony?
