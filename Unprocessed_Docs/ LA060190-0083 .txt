A Valley Center teen-ager died Thursday when her car hit a tree along a rural road. 
Marcia Ann Logue, 17, was driving west on Woods Valley Road near Lake Wohlford Road at 7:20 a.m. when her car left the road on a sharp curve and hit an oak, said California Highway Patrol Officer Jerry Bohrer. 
Logue, who lived near the accident site and traveled the road frequently, was apparently driving too fast to safely handle the curve, he said. She died at the scene.
