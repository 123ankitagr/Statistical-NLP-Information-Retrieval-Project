Author Salman Rushdie criticised two Islamic leaders in Britain who have
ruled that his conversion to the faith cannot be accepted because he has not
withdrawn his controversial novel The Satanic Verses. The author has been in
hiding since February 1989, when Iran's late leader, Ayatollah Khomeini,
ordered his execution for alleged blasphemy.
