Gospel-pop singer Amy Grant was reported doing well today after giving birth to her second child, a girl named Gloria Mills Chapman. 
The 6-pound, 8-ounce baby was born Saturday night at a Nashville hospital, said Chaz Corzine, a spokesman for the singer. 
The baby will be called "Millie," Corzine said. 
The singer and her singer-songwriter husband, Gary Chapman, also have a boy, Matthew, 2. 
Grant is a four-time Grammy Award winner. Her albums "Unguarded," "Age to Age" and "A Christmas Album" have all sold more than 1 million copies apiece.
