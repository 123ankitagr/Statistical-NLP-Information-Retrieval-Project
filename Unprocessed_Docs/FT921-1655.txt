SELF-GOVERNING hospital trusts will move into the private sector unless
limits are introduced on the number of beds used for private treatment,
according to the NHS Support Federation, a health service pressure group.
Ms Julia Schofield, director of the federation, said NHS patients would be
left with worse care and longer queues as trust hospitals increasingly
turned to a more lucrative private market.
She called for the 10 per cent limit on private beds in NHS hospitals to be
extended to trust hospitals.
The federation claimed that: there is no limit on the number of beds trusts
can provide to private patients;
trusts are under no statutory duty to enter NHS contracts;
trusts can stop making NHS contracts for a service but offer it privately;
trusts are free to close an NHS ward and reopen it as a private ward.
The health service can appeal to the health secretary if a trust attempts to
ends its contracts with the NHS.
Miss Schofield said, however, that this was not a strong enough safeguard.
There were already too few beds and the pool of doctors and nurses was
limited, so a growth in the private sector would mean longer queues for NHS
patients, she said.
