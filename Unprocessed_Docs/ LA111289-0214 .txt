First at Venice -- Director Dennis Hopper was quoted in a Nov. 5 article as saying that his 1971 "The Last Movie" made him the first American to win the Venice Film Festival. In fact, John Cassavetes was the first American to win at Venice, and he did it twice before Hopper showed up -- for "Shadows" in 1960 and "Faces" in 1968.
