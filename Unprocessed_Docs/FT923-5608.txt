sometimes known as post-viral fatigue or ME  - has real physical causes and
is not an ill-defined psychological condition, medical researchers said.
The meeting heard that the nature of the causes remained uncertain, however.
Dr Stuart Butler of the Burden Neurological Institute, Bristol, said brain
scans of chronic fatigue patients showed a prominent signal called
post-imperative negative variation (PINV).
He added: 'The fact that the PINV occurs in a number of different disorders
means that we still do not have a specific diagnostic marker for chronic
fatigue syndrome.
'However we do have a clear indication that the physiology of the cerebral
cortex is disturbed in a manner that may have something in common with
certain neurological illnesses and psychiatric disorders which have an
organic cause.'
Ms Clare Francis, a leading ME campaigner, estimates on the basis of GPs'
reports that there are 120,000 to 150,000 sufferers in the UK at any time.
Lung experts called for a complete ban on tobacco advertising and attacked
the government for failing to take action, Jennie Lynch writes.
Five scientists, led by Professor John Moxham of London University's King's
College School of Medicine, criticised the failure of the government to act
against tobacco advertising in spite of having described smoking as the main
cause of preventive disease in its recent white paper on health.
