REPUBLIC New York Corporation, the US banking group founded and controlled
by Swiss-based financier Mr Edmond Safra, said yesterday its securities
subsidiary had won approval from the Federal Reserve to conduct a
full-service securities brokerage business in the US.
The approval, granted last Friday, means Republic is one of the few US banks
allowed to operate in the domestic securities markets.
For more than half a century the commercial banking and securities
businesses have been kept strictly apart by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933.
Three years ago the Fed began to ease restrictions on banks with quality
balance sheets and strong capital positions. The first to be allowed into
the securities business were J P Morgan and Bankers Trust.
Republic, a group with Dollars 33bn in assets, is regarded by analysts as in
the same class. It has a reputation as an extremely conservative bank that
focuses on customer deposits rather than customer loans as its principal
product. This has enabled Republic to avoid many of the problems the rest of
the US banking industry has encountered with huge losses on bad loans.
Republic's subsidiary, Republic New York Securities, will begin operations
with an initial capitalisation of Dollars 100m, but will have to wait about
two weeks for its membership of the New York Stock Exchange to be approved
before it can open for business.
The parent company said its securities operation will provide full service
brokerage for institutional and retail customers, securities lending and
other securities credit activities and investment management.
Republic would not reveal further details, including whether its subsidiary
will underwrite stocks and bonds for corporate issuers.
