Cambodia's coalition government announced yesterday that it had foiled an
attempted coup d'etat over the weekend, placing a former interior minister
under house arrest and expelling one of the sons of King Norodom Sihanouk
for plotting the government's overthrow, Victor Mallet, South East Asia
Correspondent, writes.
The attempted coup appears to have been stopped in its early stages without
death or injury, but it demonstrates the fragility of Cambodian democracy a
year after the UN-organised elections.
The authorities detained Mr Sin Song, interior minister under the previous,
communist regime installed by Vietnam, in the early hours of yesterday
morning. They also expelled Prince Chakrapong, a former deputy prime
minister, putting him on a flight to Kuala Lumpur.
