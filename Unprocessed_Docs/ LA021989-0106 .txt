In my early marriage I had two miscarriages. In the first, at the first sign of something wrong, my doctor rushed me to the hospital for a D & C (dilation and curettage), and afterward I never questioned him further. 
The second time, at the first spotting, my doctor instructed me to go to bed, raise the foot of the bed and stay there until the danger passed. 
One night I had a bearing-down urge. I aborted my 3-month fetus. 
I have read in your columns so many erroneous concepts of fetuses that I felt this letter was overdue. 
My 3-month-old fetus was very definitely a baby, with a large head and not fully formed fingers and toes. It was unmistakably a male child. 
When I finally had a successful pregnancy, between 4 and 4 1/2 months I could feel the movement of my baby, and the doctor could hear his heartbeat. Within 2 weeks he was definitely kicking, and we could watch my stomach and follow his head as he turned over within me. 
So, how does one decide when it becomes murder to kill this baby?
