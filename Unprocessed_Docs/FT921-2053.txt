The official statement on the possible separation of the Duke and Duchess of
York began with the words: 'In view of the media speculation which the Queen
finds especially undesirable during the general election campaign . . . ' It
is unclear why the speculation is any more undesirable at election time than
any other. The main political interest was in how far the story would knock
yesterday's unemployment figures off the front pages of the tabloids. Anyone
who thinks that the story will die because of the Palace statement does not
know the popular press. A more intriguing question is how far the
broadsheets will follow the tabloids' example.
