Sir, your edition of April 27 shows the first green shoots of recovery.
To many professionals such as myself, involved in insolvency, your Tuesday
edition's obituary column of businesses for sale by receivers or liquidators
is a reliable barometer of the state of the economy. Today's edition,
however, has only one such business for sale - a clear sign that things are
picking up.
