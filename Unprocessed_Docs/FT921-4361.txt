Thyroid cancer among children in Belarus rose steeply last year, continuing
a sharp upward trend since the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in
neighbouring Ukraine, a health ministry official said, Reuter reports from
Moscow.
Mr Valentin Stezhko, head of the ministry's Chernobyl department, said some
50 new cases were recorded in 1991 alone, compared with 45 between 1986 and
1990. Only seven cases of thyroid cancer were detected in the five years
before the world's worst nuclear accident.
