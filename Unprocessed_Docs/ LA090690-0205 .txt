The University of Pittsburgh could align with an Eastern all-sports conference in six months to two years and would consider leaving the Big East Conference to do so, Pitt Athletic Director Ed Bozik said. 
Bozik said the conference options are almost endless -- an expanded Big East; an Eastern Seaboard conference that could include West Virginia, Miami, Florida State and South Carolina, or a 16-team "super conference" such as the Metro Conference.
