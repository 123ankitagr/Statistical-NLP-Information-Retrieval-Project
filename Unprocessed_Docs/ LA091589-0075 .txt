The video Christmas season opens this weekend with the release of "The Land Before Time" (MCA, $24.95, G), the first of several blockbuster films aimed at the gift market. 
Since they're both being released on video this fall, the similarities between "The Land Before Time" and "Bambi" (coming Sept. 28) may become even more apparent. Like "Bambi," "The Land Before Time" is an animated film concerning a young animal who's forced to cope with separation from parents and a cataclysmic event. In "Land," it's a dinosaur instead of a deer and an earthquake instead of a forest fire. 
Directed by Don Bluth ("An American Tail"), "The Land Before Time" earned mixed but generally approving reviews, and the 1988 release -- produced by George Lucas and Steven Spielberg -- made nearly $50 million at the box office. The tape has a pizza-company ad. 
Other upcoming videocassettes that will compete with "Land" and "Bambi" for the video fan's rental/purchase dollars: "Lean on Me" (Sept. 27), "Working Girl," "Major League," "The Dream Team" (all three Oct. 5), "Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "Pet Sematary" (Oct. 12), "Lawrence of Arabia" (Oct. 19), "Scrooged" (Nov. 9), "Batman" (Nov. 15) and "Ghostbusters II" (Nov. 22).
