The body of an officer killed in the crash of an Air Force cargo jet in West Germany was flown here Sunday, the first victim of the accident to be returned to the United States. 
The remains of Capt. Bradley R. Schuldt of Arlington Heights, Ill., arrived at Dover Air Force Base on a C-5 cargo jet from Rhein Main Air Base near Frankfurt. 
Schuldt was among 13 Air Force personnel killed when their C-5 crashed shortly after takeoff from Ramstein Air Base on Wednesday. Four others were injured. 
Air Force officials said there were no plans to hold honors ceremonies here for any of the crash victims.
