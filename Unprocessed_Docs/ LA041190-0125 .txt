"Sajak" Producer to Helm New Late-Night Show: Michael Weisman, the former executive producer of NBC Sports and the current executive producer of the now-canceled "Pat Sajak Show," is developing a new late-night show for CBS that is scheduled to debut this summer in the 12:30 a.m. time slot. Weisman took control of the beleaguered CBS talk show last January. Of the low-rated "Sajak," which will air for the last time Friday, Weisman said, "It is ironic that we will have our last show on Good Friday, but as one of my writers said: 'Yeah, but on Easter Sunday, we won't be coming back.'
