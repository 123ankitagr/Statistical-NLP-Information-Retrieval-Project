Mr Don McCrickard, the former TSB Group chief executive who resigned in
August last year, received a payment of Pounds 763,432, it has been
disclosed in the bank's annual report, writes John Gapper.
The bank said that Mr McCrickard received the sum because he was on a
three-year rolling contract which entitled him to a severance sum worth
three times his final salary, plus an amount to compensate for benefits.
Mr McCrickard's total emoluments in 1991 were Pounds 252,200. Mr Peter
Ellwood, who succeeded him as chief executive, received Pounds 373,407 last
year and was the bank's highest paid director.
The bank said yesterday that its directors were now all on one-year rolling
contracts.
