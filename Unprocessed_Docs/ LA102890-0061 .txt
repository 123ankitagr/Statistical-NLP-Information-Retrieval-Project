I wish I could vote in November. If I could I would vote yes for Big Green (Proposition 128). 
I can't because I'm only 13. I listened to the ads against Big Green. They are so stupid and full of lies that even a 13-year-old like me can see them. 
You adults have given us kids an ugly world full of poisons and smog. My friends and I are really mad. We want to breathe clean air and drink clean water. Don't we have rights, too? Here is your chance to do something for us and the environment. If you wait until I can vote, it will be too late. Vote yes for Big Green.
