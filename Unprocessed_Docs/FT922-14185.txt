Vanessa Houlder (Property Market, April 3) has fallen into the trap of
describing Docklands as laissez-faire. Rates holidays and tax allowances are
not laissez-faire, they are dirigiste. For example, there has been no
pension fund investment in Docklands - why invest in such a risky location
if you do not need to save tax?
Regional policy has been a proven failure since the Second World War. Left
to the free market and a liberal town and country planning policy, Docklands
would have been quite different.
