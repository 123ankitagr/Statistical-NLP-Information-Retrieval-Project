In a sign of the thaw in Vatican-Soviet relations, Moscow has for the first time given Pope John Paul II permission to fly over the Soviet Union. 
Moscow has agreed to let Italy's Alitalia airline fly the Polish-born Pope over Soviet territory this month when he sets off on a tour of South Korea, Indonesia and Mauritius, Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls said Friday.
