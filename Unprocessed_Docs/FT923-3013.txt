FOOTBALL sponsorship on a different scale arrived yesterday. John
Waddington, the Leeds-based games maker, announced that its table-top
Subbuteo football players will display on their shirts the logos of some of
the companies that sponsor real-life soccer teams.
Around 250,000 Subbuteo sets are sold in 50 countries each year, with about
15m miniature players involved. But no money is changing hands in this
particular 'transfer' deal; Sharp (shirt sponsor of Manchester United), JVC
(Arsenal) and leisure-wear manufacturer Admiral (Leeds United) will have
their names appear on the little men for free.
Not all sponsored teams will feature; those involving alcohol will be
excluded, as unsuitable for a children's toy.
'Sponsorship is playing an increasingly important role and we thought it
only right that Subbuteo players should be kitted out in the same strip as
their larger counterparts,' said Waddington.
Subbuteo has been paid for sponsorships in the past; Cadbury and Rowntree
each paid about Pounds 4,000 to have their logos printed on perimeter fence
advertising in the special edition 1990 World Cup sets.
