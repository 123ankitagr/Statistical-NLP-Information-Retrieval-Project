Alba is to purchase Goodmans Industries, its rival consumer electronics
group, for a maximum of Pounds 3.6m in shares and cash.
Goodmans, which specialises in in-car entertainment and domestic audio and
visual products and ranks first in brand share in the home karaoke market,
incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 1.09m in the 12 months to end-January
1994 on turnover of Pounds 36.4m. Net assets at that date were Pounds
876,000. Until January 1993 it formed part of TGI, the professional and
consumer audio manufacturer.
Mr David Harris, chief executive of Alba, which also takes in the Bush and
Hinari brands, said: 'Goodmans is an established brand name which will
produce new opportunities for profit.
'The acquisition reinforces Alba's focus and adds another quality brand to
our portfolio.'
Alba will also subscribe for Pounds 700,000 of new Goodmans shares and fund
the repayment of Pounds 250,000 of loan stock.
