Uni-Charm, Japan's biggest producer of children's nappies, has set up a
joint venture with Molnlycke, part of Sweden's SCA forest products group, to
make and sell 'panty-nappies' for the European market, writes Ronald van de
Krol in the Hague.
The venture, located at Molnlycke's existing facilities in the Netherlands,
is 60 per cent-owned by Uni-Charm which is providing manufacturing
technology while Molnlycke will handle marketing.
