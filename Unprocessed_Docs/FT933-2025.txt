REFUGE ASSURANCE, the life insurance group, yesterday reported a 4.9 per
cent rise in regular premium long-term business in the first six months of
1993 to Pounds 18.8m.
However, the group's annual premium business in life and pensions fell
slightly by 6.7 per cent to Pounds 24.7m.
Refuge said yesterday it was raising its interim dividend to 10.35p per
share, up from 9.60p. Also, it will seek shareholder approval for a
two-for-one scrip issue at an extraordinary general meeting to be called on
November 18.
Unit trust sales for the first six months of 1992 rose sharply to Pounds
4.6m from Pounds 2.7m a year earlier.
In general insurance, premiums were marginally lower at Pounds 6.4m against
Pounds 6.6m. Refuge said theft claims continued to cause concern, although
there had been a slight reduction in the past few weeks.
