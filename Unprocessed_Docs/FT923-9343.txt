THE sushi, sashimi and noodle bars of Paris could become the next casualties
of the Japanese trade war as the French government has slapped new
restrictions on imports of Japanese food into France.
The authorities are concerned about the allegedly high levels of
radioactivity in certain imported Japanese foods, particularly mushrooms and
dairy products. Late last month, France said it was tightening controls over
Japanese food imports, worth FFr196m (Pounds 20m) last year.
Since August 1, all Japanese food consignments have been subject to
radioactivity checks on arrival in France. From August 15 the French will
only allow food into the country if it has been tested - and certificated -
in Japan.
This poses a potentially serious problem for anyone buying Japanese food in
France. This includes the 30,000-strong Japanese expatriate population and
the growing band of Japanese restaurants. Japanese food is now very popular
with the French. The area around rue Saint-Anne at the back of the
Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris has become a tiny 'Tokyotown' with dozens of
noodle bars. It is a common sight on the Paris streets to see motorbikes,
and even rickshaws, delivering sushi ordered by telephone or the Minitel
computer network.
So far the radioactivity checks have caused only a slight delay in Japanese
food supplies. Higuma, one of the rue Sainte-Anne noodle bars, said its
supplies were coming through as usual.
But after August 15, there is a risk that some products will no longer be
available, either because they fail to comply with the new regulations, or
because Japanese exporters divert consignments to other, more accessible
countries. The Japanese embassy in Paris warned that prices might have to
rise to cover the cost of the tests.
Mr Higa Shiuchi, manager of Kinugawa, one of Paris' most exclusive Japanese
restaurants, is concerned about the threat of shortages. Like many Japanese
restaurants, imports all its food from Japan, apart from fresh fruit and
fish.
