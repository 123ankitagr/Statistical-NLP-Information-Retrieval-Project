LIEUTENANT General John Shalikashvili, the US army officer who last year
headed the operation to protect and supply Kurds in northern Iraq, has been
appointed Nato's supreme commander in Europe to replace General John Galvin,
writes David White in London. Born in Warsaw of a Polish mother and Georgian
father, the 55-year-old Gen Shalikashvili formerly commanded the US 7th Army
in Germany and is currently senior assistant to Gen Colin Powell, chairman
of the US joint chiefs of staff.
Nato allies have shelved the idea of appointing a European to the job, which
has gone to US generals ever since Gen Dwight Eisenhower first held it in
1950. Such a move would have reflected the greater role European allies are
to assume in their own defence, with US forces in Europe being cut by half
to 150,000 and possibly less. The allies have been anxious not to alienate
US opinion and maintain a strong US presence in Europe.
