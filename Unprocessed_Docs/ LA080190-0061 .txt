Lincoln National Bank Renamed: The parent of Lincoln National Bank in Encino said it changed the bank's name to California United Bank after a federal judge last week refused to block the switch. 
The bank chose the new name to avoid confusion with Lincoln Savings & Loan, the troubled Irvine thrift. But United California Savings Bank, based in Santa Ana, sued to prevent the change on grounds that the proposed new name was too similar to its own. Lincoln National Bank's parent changed its name to CU Bancorp.
