Has Robin Leigh-Pemberton caught that 'end of term' feeling? With less than
a month to go before he steps down as governor of the Bank of England, it
sounds as if his jokes are becoming rather risque.
He's been wowing New York bankers with a variation on the old tale about the
heart transplant patient who was offered a choice of donors: an 18-year-old
athlete or a 70-year-old central banker. The preferred Leigh-Pemberton
version involves a brain transplant and a senior Treasury official, although
the punchline's the same. The patient chooses the Treasury official's brain -because the organ had never been used.
But when it comes to recycling old chestnuts, who is Observer to complain?
