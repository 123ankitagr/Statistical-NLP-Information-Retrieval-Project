After reading Peter Sellars' commentary in "The Big Mix" Feb. 5, I nearly fell into a suicidal despondency because I'm culturally anemic, American and white. 
But before I reached for a razor blade, I began reviewing my recent cultural experiences to see how many could be categorized as ethnically themed. I tried to visualize how many involved a different skin color, hoping desperately that Thai food would count. 
Is this what Sellars wants? With his separatist attitude, he is defeating his own purpose, building partitions instead of breaking them. To pinpoint any art as black, Asian, Hispanic, etc., is a disservice to the artists, who probably like me would have never given it a thought and have taken for granted that it was simply American art.
