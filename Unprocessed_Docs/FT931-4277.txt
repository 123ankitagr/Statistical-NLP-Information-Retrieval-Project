THE BRUH family clearly prefer to manage using the 'flying by the seat of
the pants' method. They have shared values and a strong vision of the
company's future direction. Computers are employed where they give an
advantage - and ignored where they seem more trouble than they're worth.
Mr Robert Bruh uses 'SuperProject' somewhat like a fighter pilot uses an
altimeter. It says where the ground is, but that information isn't as
valuable as knowing where the enemy is located.
Frank Usher uses project management tools merely as a one-off test for
bottlenecks, rather than on a day-to-day basis. This limits the bene fits
that the package could bring. If there is a delayin fabric supplies, Mr Bruh
relies on his instincts for re-scheduling, rather than upon the software .
It seems a limited use of a software tool. Other companies we have studied
have seen considerable savings by using project management tools to manage
unforeseen events.
I doubt Frank Usher's management can fully tackle all the complex
re-arrangement of works in their heads. Their command of the business may
mean that they survive, nonetheless. It is a contrast with many companies
who become slaves to IT - and take their eyes off their customers and
competitors.
Key points of this study:
Use information technology (IT) as and when it is appropriate.
IT is only a tool to help your business.
