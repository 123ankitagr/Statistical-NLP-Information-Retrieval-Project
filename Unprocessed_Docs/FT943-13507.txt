Standard & Poor's has raised its implied rating on the Czech National Bank's
senior foreign currency debt to triple-B plus from triple-B, writes Antonia
Sharpe. The rating outlook remains positive. S&P said the upgrade and
outlook reflected the Czech Republic's smooth transition from a planned to a
market economy and that the rating was supported by the country's position
as a net international creditor and prudent economic management.
