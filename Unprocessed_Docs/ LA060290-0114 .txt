Youth for Christ, an evangelical organization that had Billy Graham as one of its first employees, has announced that it is moving its national headquarters to Colorado Springs, Colo. 
Its headquarters had been in Wheaton and Carol Stream, Ill., in suburban Chicago, which has been called the nation's evangelical capital because of the many Christian groups based there. 
Youth for Christ has 235 chapters around the country, 900 staff persons and 8,000 volunteers. 
Officials of the organization said that Dallas, Indianapolis and Orlando, Fla., were also considered for the new headquarters. 
Reasons for the move included lower costs and a desire to develop "more of our own identity" by relocating "out of an area where there are so many Christian organizations." 
Another large organization, Campus Crusade for Christ, last year announced that it will move its headquarters from San Bernardino to Orlando.
