Luciano Pavarotti says a diet to reduce his substantial girth has melted away 80 pounds. 
When pressed at a news conference Wednesday, however, he refused to say how much he weighs. 
"I have lost 80 pounds and so I am 80 pounds less than I was," Pavarotti said with a broad smile. Asked how he did it, Pavarotti replied: "Very simple. I don't take alcohol, sugar or fat. Just 1,800 calories a day. It's brilliant." 
To laughter, he said: "Tonight, I will have a beautiful piece of salmon with vegetables, a piece of bread, strawberries, mineral water and lemon and coffee. What do you want more?" 
The 54-year-old Italian tenor was in London for his first appearance in nearly six years at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden.
