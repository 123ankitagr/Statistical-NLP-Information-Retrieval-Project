A walkout stalled trains, buses and subways in Spain on Thursday as transportation workers pressed demands for higher wages and improved working conditions. The state railway ran only a skeleton service on the first day of a three-day strike that coincided with a one-day stoppage by public transport employees in Madrid, Barcelona and several other cities.
