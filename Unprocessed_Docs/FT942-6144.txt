The man who promoted Costa Rica's 'debt-for-nature swaps' has come up with
another instrument he thinks could provide part of the solution to the
long-term preservation of its diminishing rainforests and combat global
warming.
Alvaro Umana, former minister of natural resources, is touting a 'carbon
bond' through which companies in developed countries can offset greenhouse
gas emissions by financing forest preservation.
He argues that Costa Rica provides a global service by guaranteeing the
storage of carbon through preserving its forests, for which it should be
financially compensated.
'At a very low price of Dollars 10 (Pounds 6.60) a tonne (of stored carbon)
that means Costa Rica has about a Dollars 1bn chip,' he says. 'But there is
no market to cash it in, yet.'
The 1992 Convention on Climate Change, agreed at the Rio summit, called on
industrialised nations to stabilise emissions by the year 2000 at their 1990
level. Emission ceilings will be imposed on individual companies, but under
the convention they are permitted to emit carbon in one place and sequester
it in another.
Some utility companies in the US and Canada, with an environmentally
friendly bent, have shown interest in the proposal, including Ontario Hydro,
run by Maurice Strong, who chaired the Rio summit.
But interest is also being generated because the bonds make good business
sense, claims Umana. 'They know it's coming, and they think they might be
able to get cheaper carbon futures now.' Companies would exchange cash - to
preserve the forest - for permits allowing them higher emissions.
Umana admits the project's success will depend on whether Costa Rica can
develop a mechanism of verification that will be acceptable to the
industrial countries.
