Virgin Atlantic yesterday responded to last week's cuts in fares by British
Airways by saying it is to cut more than Pounds 100 from fares on its
London-New York and London-Los Angeles routes.
Last week BA said it was making big cuts on more than 50 routes, including
those to New York and Los Angeles. The Virgin offer brings its New York fare
down to Pounds 238 and the Los Angeles fare to Pounds 318 - Pounds 1 lower
than BA's prices.
Virgin's offer, like that of BA, is open to passengers booking until April
15, and trips must include a Saturday night away.
