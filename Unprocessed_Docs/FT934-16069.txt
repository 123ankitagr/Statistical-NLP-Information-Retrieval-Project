AN ESTIMATED 2 1/2 m young people make no attempt to vote, a survey for the
British Youth Council, has found.
The council said the non-registration of people aged 17 to 24 was a 'serious
threat to our democratic process'. Its research shows that non-registration
is highest in London where one in four young people are not on the voting
register. It is planning a campaign to encourage more young people to vote.
