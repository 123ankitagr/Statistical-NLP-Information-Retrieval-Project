San Diego Chargers coach Dan Henning keeps stating that "down the road" his highly erratic and ineffective quarterback, Billy Joe Tolliver, will prove "over a period of time" to be capable of handling the position. 
Well, if Billy Joe Tolliver doesn't learn real soon how to play catch with Anthony Miller and not the stadium peanut vendors the only thing "down the road" will be Charger fans!
