Australia's Labor government announced a wages deal with the unions
yesterday that is designed to create 500,000 jobs over three years, Kevin
Brown reports from Sydney.
It was dismissed, however, by Mr John Hewson, leader of the conservative
Liberal/National Party coalition, and challenger in next month's federal
election. 'They have had six accords so far, and all that has done is create
1m unemployed,' he said.
The accord is intended to speed up the decentralisation of Australia's wage
bargaining system by ensuring that most negotiations are based on
productivity at plant level.
