Soviet forces have withdrawn from Afghanistan. Democracy is spreading throughout Eastern Europe. 
The Berlin Wall has fallen and German reunification is imminent. And the Warsaw Pact nations no longer threaten the world with aggression. 
When will the British withdraw from Ireland? When will the reunification of that ancient country occur? When will the Western Bloc nations -- particularly the U.S. -- censure England for its aggression and bring about its end? 
Occupation of Ireland by England. Occupation of Panama by the U.S. Occupation of Gaza and the West Bank by Israel. 
Ever wonder why our country and its pals are labeled imperialists?
