Four-term socialist Mayor Bernard Sanders' party won another victory in Burlington, Vt., as former community development director Peter Clavelle defeated Alderman Nancy Chioffi to become Sanders' successor. Clavelle, the Progressive Coalition candidate, had 5,626 ballots, or 52% of the vote, to 4,400, or 41%, for Democrat Chioffi, a store owner who also had Republican backing, according to unofficial results. Sanders -- often billed as the nation's only socialist mayor -- had decided against another term.
