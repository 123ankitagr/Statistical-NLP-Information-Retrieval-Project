TAIWAN will seek aerospace technology from the US as part of its purchase of
150 F-16 jet fighters for about Dollars 6bn, Taiwanese officials said
yesterday, Reuter reports.
The government will ask General Dynamics, which makes the aircraft, to
provide local companies with technology to repair and produce parts when
company executives visit Taiwan early next month.
'Such an offset agreement would not only expand business opportunities for
our companies, but help us improve maintenance for military aircraft,' said
Mr David Chu, head of the Taiwanese cabinet's Committee for Aviation and
Space Industry Development.
The US gave permission last September for the F-16s to be sold to Taiwan.
Taiwan's parliament approved the first instalment of the purchase price last
month, but adopted a resolution requiring the government to negotiate
technology transfers that would let Taiwanese companies produce parts worth
at least 10 per cent of the contract.
The island is eager to develop its fledgling aerospace industry.
