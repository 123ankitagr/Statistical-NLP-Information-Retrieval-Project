The Taiwanese have proposed swapping unofficial representatives with China -- a major step toward ending one of the last Cold War standoffs. 
Senior Cabinet official Ma Ying-jeow on Wednesday told legislators that Taipei wants to set up "private offices" in cities throughout China and would reciprocate by allowing Beijing to do the same in Taiwan. 
"Our contact would be . . . practical and mutual," said Ma, one of the chief architects of Taiwan's China policy. 
He stressed that the suggestion does not imply recognition of the Beijing government. 
Nevertheless, many Taiwanese believe that the older hard-liners finally have been forced to abandon their policy of "no contact, no negotiation, no compromise" with Beijing.
