Fierce opposition by Europe's exporters to European Commission plans to
harmonise medium- and long-term export credit insurance regimes will be
voiced in Brussels today when a five-country delegation meets senior
commission officials, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports from
London.
Proposals to limit the level of bank credit cover will be at the top of a
nine-point list of complaints about proposed changes. The Commission is
planning to trim cover to 95 per cent of the proportion of an export
contract's value covered by export credit agencies. This contrasts with the
UK practice of covering the full value of a buyer credit.
Leading today's delegation - representing exporters from Germany, Holland,
Spain, France and the UK - Mr Keith Johnson, export finance manager of
Siemens Plessey and deputy chairman of the British Exporters' Association,
said harmonisation plans reflected 'introspective activity by EU officials',
largely for the convenience of treasuries across Europe, which are trying to
reduce their support for exporters.
