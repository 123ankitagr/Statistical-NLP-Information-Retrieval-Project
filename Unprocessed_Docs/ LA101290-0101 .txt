Trump Seeks to Restructure Loans: Developer Donald J. Trump is seeking to restructure $100 million in casino bank loans, a spokesman said. The move comes just two months after a bank rescue package was stitched together to keep his real estate and casino empire from unraveling. 
Trump, whose holdings are burdened with more than $3 billion in debt, has been trying to reduce interest payments on his bank loans and junk bonds. Current talks focus on borrowings used to buy two of Trump's three Atlantic City, N.J., casinos, the Trump Castle and the Taj Mahal, the glitzy property which opened earlier this year. He also owns the Trump Plaza casino, which is healthier than the other two. "We are having conversations with bank lenders at the same time we are talking with bondholders," said Trump's chief financial officer, Stephen Bollenbach.
