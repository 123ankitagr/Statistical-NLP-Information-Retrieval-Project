Are you near or at the limit on your lines of credit? 
Do you take out a new loan before the old one is paid off or take out a new one to pay off the old loan? 
Are you unsure about how much you owe? 
Are your monthly credit bills -- excluding rent or mortgage payments -- more than 15% to 20% of your net income? 
If you lost your job would you be in immediate financial difficulty?
