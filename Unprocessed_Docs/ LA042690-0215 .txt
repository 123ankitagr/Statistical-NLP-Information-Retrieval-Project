The City Council unanimously chose Evelyn Fierro as mayor and Dick Richards as mayor pro tem. 
Fierro, 41, a former television news journalist who last fall started a public relations firm, is in her first term on the council. 
She was elected to the four-year position in 1988. She also is running as a Democrat for the 42nd District Assembly seat held by Republican Richard Mountjoy of Arcadia. 
A retired FBI agent, Richards, 68, is a businessman. He won his seat in a special election last fall. 
Unlike many other San Gabriel Valley cities, South Pasadena selects its mayor and mayor pro tem once a year, rather than allowing the positions to rotate among five council members during a four-year period.
