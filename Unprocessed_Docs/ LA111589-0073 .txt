After 10 months on the job, Avalon City Manager Chuck Prince is leaving Santa Catalina Island to accept a position as manager of the redevelopment agency in the City of South Lake Tahoe. 
Prince, 34, will remain as Avalon city manager until the end of the year while a successor is sought. He will begin his new job as redevelopment manager of the South Tahoe Redevelopment Agency in January, said South Lake Tahoe City Manager Kerry Miller. 
Avalon Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith said city officials had been pleased with Prince's performance and were surprised at his resignation.
