COCOA prices tumbled in both London and New York. London's July contract set
a fresh 16-year low of Pounds 552 a tonne before closing at Pounds 554.
London traders were unable to define a specific reason for the fall. 'There
wasn't even any clear sign of Ivorian selling today. Perhaps it's just
boredom or perhaps people are selling in anticipation of Ivory Coast coming
back into the market again in the middle of next week,' one London trader
said. New York analysts pointed to the upwardly revised forecast for Ivorian
production this season from trade house Gill & Duffus, which sent prices
lower on Wednesday. London robusta COFFEE ended mixed, while New York
arabicas saw choppy trade in the morning. The New York market ignored
reports that Brazil and Colombia had signed a coffee pact. This meant,
however, that a Brazilian denial of the report also had little effect. On
the LME TIN prices ended lower after coming under late kerb pressure from
selling and profit taking prompted by an earlier rise to a fresh 19-month
high. Trading in the other metals was generally routine. In Chicago fund
selling pushed MAIZE and SOYABEAN prices down in early trading.
