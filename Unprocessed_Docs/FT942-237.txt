North Korea has suspended its usual loudspeaker broadcasts of propaganda
against the Southern president at the truce line dividing the communist and
capitalist states, writes Bradley Martin in Seoul.
The broadcasts attacking South Korean President Kim Young-sam, normally
directed to southern soldiers along the border, halted at 5pm on Tuesday,
just before the announcement of an agreement to hold the summit in Pyongyang
next month.
Temporarily turning off its propaganda insults has been a standard North
Korean measure whenever the two sides approach face-to-face meetings. The
pattern has been for the insults to resume after failure of the talks. In
recent months North Korean propaganda has denounced the South Korean
president as a traitor. Seoul generally is more restrained in its broadcast
characterisations of North Korean President Kim Il-sung.
