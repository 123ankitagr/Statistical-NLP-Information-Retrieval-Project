The hearing for a San Diego snake breeder whose home was raided by animal-control officers last month was continued Monday until late July. 
John Humphrey, the department's hearing officer, said he has asked zoo officials to help draft animal-control guidelines for en forcing the city ordinance barring "dangerous snakes". 
In the hearing, San Carlos resident Gary Sipperley is seeking the return of 19 large snakes confiscated by county animal control after a June 28 search of his home.
