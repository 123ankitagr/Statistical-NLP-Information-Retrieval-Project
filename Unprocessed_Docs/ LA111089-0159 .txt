The city's director of public works has been suspended for two weeks without pay after acknowledging that he made unauthorized use of staff time and improperly billed the city for use of his car, City Manager Paul Brady Jr. said Thursday. 
Harry Ehrlich, who heads the 250-employee department, will be on unpaid leave from Nov. 20 to Dec. 6, Brady said. In addition, Ehrlich already has repaid the city about $1,400. 
Ehrlich, who earns $80,000 a year, was in Washington on city business Thursday and could not be reached for comment. 
Based on information provided to Brady by a department employee, an investigation determined that Ehrlich instructed his secretary -- who no longer works for the city -- to type his master's thesis and church documents on city time and overtime during the past six years. In addition, although he used a city vehicle, he was reimbursed as if he had used his personal car for city business. 
Ehrlich and Brady met with the public works staff earlier this week, Brady said, so that Ehrlich could "explain and apologize to them for his actions." 
The two men assured the staff that there would be no retribution against any employee for bringing such information to the city manager's office. 
"This is not acceptable conduct in this organization," Brady said, "from department head to entry-level employee." MARK I. PINSKY
