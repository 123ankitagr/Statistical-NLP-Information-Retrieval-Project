Sir, Your excellent survey on business air travel had one small mistake in
the table ('Non-stop return fares to New York from European cities', May
11). Despite 18-inches more leg room, free economy class tickets, and more
air hostesses in Business Class, we actually charge the same basic fare as
our competitors.
