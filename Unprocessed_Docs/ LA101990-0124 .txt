A Newport Beach psychiatrist who failed to appear for his sentencing after pleading guilty to sexually molesting a 29-year-old male patient was arrested Thursday in Laredo, Tex., the FBI said. 
Dr. James Harrington White, 47, was arrested at the Laredo border checkpoint as he entered the country with a 16-year-old boy, FBI spokesman Wylie B. Cox said. 
Authorities have not determined the boy's relationship with White, who fled Orange County before being sentenced Aug. 29 on two counts of sexual molestation. 
White, who was highly successful and had homes in Newport Beach, Palm Desert and Mammoth Lakes, was accused of drugging a male patient who had moved into his home and performing a sex act while videotaping it. 
White was being held in the Webb County Law Enforcement Center and is scheduled to appear before a U.S. magistrate. Before he fled, White faced a maximum sentence of 10 years.
