A revival in demand for cement, allied with firmer prices, helped ACC,
India's biggest cement producer and part of India's Tata group, to post net
profits of Rs851m (Dollars 27m) for the six months to end-September, up from
Rs357m a year ago, writes Kunal Bose in Calcutta.
The company's income rose nearly 22 per cent to Rs9.3bn as cement sales rose
to 4.6m tonnes from 4m tonnes.
