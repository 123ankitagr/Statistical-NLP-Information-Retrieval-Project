Clashes on the Tajik-Afghan border, leaving at least seven Russian soldiers
dead and 13 wounded, have provoked friction between Moscow and Kabul, writes
John Thornhill in Moscow. The Russian Foreign Ministry yesterday warned the
Afghan government to stop encouraging armed incursions by Tajik opposition
forces. Russian news agencies reported 200 Tajik militants, supported by
Afghan mujahideen, crossed into Tajikistan on Thursday night and attacked
Russian border posts. Russian troops are stationed there under an agreement
with Tajikistan.
