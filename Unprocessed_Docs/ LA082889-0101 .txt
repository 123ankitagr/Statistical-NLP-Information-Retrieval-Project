Elizabeth Taylor has penned her memoirs -- but don't look for them in the supermarket racks any time soon. 
"Miss Taylor has in fact completed a manuscript which chronicles her life but there are no immediate plans for its release," according to a statement from Taylor's publicist, Chen Sam & Associates. 
The statement was issued in the wake of the disclosure by C. David Heymann, author of a best-selling biography of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, that he would soon begin work on a biography of Taylor. "She might cooperate. She hasn't given me a no yet" he said. 
But Taylor's publicist said the actress has never spoken with Heymann "nor does she have any plans to collaborate with him."
