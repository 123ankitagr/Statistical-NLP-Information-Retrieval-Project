MEASURES announced in last month's Budget will reduce UK new car sales by
about 100,000 this year, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of Peugeot
Talbot, warned yesterday.
The chief executives of Peugeot Talbot, Rover, Ford of Britain and Vauxhall
are to meet Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, next Wednesday. They plan to
call specifically for a cut in the 10 per cent rate of special car tax.
Mr Whalen said the industry was also seeking an urgent meeting with Mr Peter
Lilley, trade and industry secretary.
Mr Whalen said Peugeot Talbot, with other car makers, had reduced its
forecast for new car sales this year to only 1.7m from an earlier forecast
before the Budget of 1.8m.
The company now expects a 15 per cent decline in demand from sales last year
of 2m. Demand in 1989 reached 2.3m.
Sales of new cars fell by 21.6 per cent in the first quarter this year
following a drop of 12.7 per cent in the whole of 1990, while new commercial
vehicle sales have been hit by a plunge in sales this year of 32.8 per cent
following a drop last year of 20.9 per cent.
Car manufacturers have become alarmed by what they see as an increasingly
hostile government attitude.
The industry has been dismayed by Budget measures - in particular, higher
fuel taxes, increased personal benefit taxation of company cars, and the
imposition of national insurance contributions on company cars. Industry
leaders are incensed in particular that the chancellor failed to reduce the
special car tax when he announced an increase in VAT from 15 per cent to
17.5 per cent. Other Budget measures included higher fuel taxes.
The industry argues that no other leading vehicle-producing country in
Europe singles out cars for such a discriminatory tax as the special car
tax.
