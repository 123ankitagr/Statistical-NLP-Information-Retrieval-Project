If only for a day, the nation's capital had an afternoon newspaper Friday. 
"BUSTED," said the 2 1/2-inch headline above the lead stories in a special edition of the Washington Times that chronicled the arrest of District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry on drug charges. Most of the 24-page edition was devoted to Barry's arrest at a downtown hotel Thursday night. 
Not since the Washington Star folded in 1981 had residents of the area seen a local afternoon newspaper. 
The "EXTRA!" was sold by hawkers outside the rival Washington Post; the District Building, Washington's city hall; the Vista International Hotel, where Barry was arrested, and at downtown subway stations, said Linda Clark, a spokeswoman for the Times, a morning paper published Monday through Friday. 
The lead stories outlined how Barry was apprehended as part of an FBI sting operation, contained information concerning his arraignment and had comments from a news conference held by U.S. Atty. Jay B. Stephens. 
Also, the special edition contained comments from elementary school students and residents of the city along with an editorial and a column on Barry's arrest. 
The newspaper called its afternoon edition "Special Report: The Barry Crackup." 
Meanwhile, the news of Barry's arrest made the front pages Friday of all major newspapers in Bogota, Colombia, the center of the world cocaine trade. 
El Espectador, a newspaper that has long crusaded against the drug trade and was bombed by traffickers several months ago, ran a photograph of Barry at the top of its front page with the caption: "Drug-Addict Mayor." 
Another photo inside showed Barry along with former New York Mayor Edward I. Koch and Bogota Mayor Andres Pastrana at an anti-drug mayors' meeting last June. 
The other major Bogota daily, El Tiempo, ran a front-page story under the headline: "Black mayor of Washington arrested buying cocaine."
