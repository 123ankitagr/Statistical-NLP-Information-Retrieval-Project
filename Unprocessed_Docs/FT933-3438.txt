Sir, Of what is Prof John Broome a professor? Capitalism does not, as he
asserts ('Morality of greed and nepotism', September 11/12), reward either
talent, or hard work, glibness or goodness. It rewards only risk, daringly
courted and successfully overcome. This is not mere captiousness. Unless we
can create a wider understanding of how the wealth which we all need for our
living is really created, then academic degrees and high morality
notwithstanding, we shall simply destroy each other over an inexorably
dwindling pool of resources.
I know you understand this, sir; but how many more professors are there out
there?
