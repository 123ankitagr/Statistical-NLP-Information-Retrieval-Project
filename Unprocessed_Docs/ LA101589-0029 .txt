It was interesting to come across Calendar's Oct. 8 article on Rickie Lee Jones. I'm a retiree and was totally unaware of her talent until I heard her on TV doing the old Eddie Cantor song, "Making Whoopee." 
So I went to record stores on Florida's Gulf Coast trying to find tapes of her doing music of the '20s and '30s. Clerks remarked that many older people were asking for the same thing. 
Jones is missing a market if she doesn't do more of the '20s and '30s with her cute voice.
