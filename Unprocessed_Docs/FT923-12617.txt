SETTLEMENT of sexual discrimination claims made by Miss Alison Halford, an
assistant chief constable, is expected today.
Merseyside Police Authority is to hold an emergency meeting this afternoon.
A source close to the authority said last night it was understood there
would be a request for Miss Halford to be allowed to retire with a full
pension on medical grounds.
The Manchester industrial tribunal which has been hearing the case is due to
reconvene after the authority's meeting and it is understood that Miss
Halford will abandon her discrimination claims in return for disciplinary
charges against her being dropped.
Mr Eldred Tabachnik QC, counsel for Miss Halford, said negotiations were at
an 'advanced' stage.
