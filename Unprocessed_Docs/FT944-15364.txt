Caterpillar, the US manufacturer of earthmoving and mining equipment,
expects its sales in China to increase to Dollars 500m a year by 2000. Mr
Donald Fites, the company's chairman, who is in China to sign two joint
venture agreements to produce hydraulic excavators and diesel engines, said
Caterpillar sales in China last year were between Dollars 50m and Dollars
100m.
Caterpillar is investing Dollars 30m in the ventures with the Xuzhou
Construction Machinery Group and Shanghai Diesel Engine. The company is also
planning to establish a holding company to oversee its China business. Mr
Fites said China's drive to improve its infrastructure, including roads and
ports, provided great opportunities.
