Hurray for the Red, White and Blue. A rare white tiger owned by illusionists Siegfried and Roy has given birth to three cubs in Osaka, Japan, where the entertainers are appearing. The tigress, Sitarra, has mothered 12 of the 17 white tigers born into the Siegfried and Roy collection, the largest privately owned collection of white tigers in the world. The new additions, born on the eve of the Fourth of July, will be named Red, White and Blue in honor of Independence Day. The German-born illusionists, Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn, became American citizens last October shortly before opening a six-month engagement in Japan. ALEENE MacMINN
