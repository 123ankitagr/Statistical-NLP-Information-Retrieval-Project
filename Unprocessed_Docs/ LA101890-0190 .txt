City Clerk Janet Berry will hold two positions when she replaces city treasurer Charlene Jung, who resigned last week. 
The City Council voted unanimously Tuesday to appoint Berry to serve until the April, 1992, election. That will avoid the cost of a special election, estimated at $40,000 to $50,000. 
The city charter allows the council to choose between appointment and a special election to fill such a vacancy, city spokesman Tom Manheim said. 
Jung, who was elected treasurer in 1988, left to work as investment manager for the city of Anaheim.
