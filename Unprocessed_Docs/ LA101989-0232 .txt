Out-of-work managers over age 50 found jobs faster than their younger colleagues in the job market last summer, according to a survey released today by Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. 
"The results represent the first time in 15 years of tracking job searches that the 50-and-over age group has surpassed its younger counterparts in the length of time it takes to find a new job," said James E. Challenger, president and founder of the job-search consulting firm. 
The firm's survey of third-quarter employment patterns showed the median time needed for an out-of-work manager age 50 or over to find new work was 3.23 months. Unemployed managers in all other age groups required a median time of 3.26 months.
