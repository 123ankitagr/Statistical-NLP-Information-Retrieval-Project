And now, a word of warning to all those hapless European parents who have
only just got around to junking Mutant Ninja Turtle, Batman, Jurassic Park
(etc) T-shirts, pencil cases, underwear and so on, accumulated by their
children from bygone ages. Go into hibernation now - the Flintstones are
coming.
The whole world - apart from Ulan Bator maybe - is about to be swamped with
Flintstones' merchandising, coinciding with the release of a film based on
the cartoon caveman characters. Turner Home Entertainment owns the rights;
and wild pterodactyls won't stop the onward march towards merchandising
sales estimated at Pounds 640m.
And the profits? Prehistoric, by some US corporate standards.
