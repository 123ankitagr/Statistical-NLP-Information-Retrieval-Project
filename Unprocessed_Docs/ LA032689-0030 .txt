I have just finished seeing the five movies nominated for best picture in the Oscar race:  -- "Working Girl," a piece of fluff with uninspired direction;  -- "Dangerous Liaisons," about people I care nothing about;  -- One truly good movie, "Mississippi Burning," which features a performance by a national treasure, Gene Hackman;  -- "Accidental Tourist," a lovely "little" picture that rates a 7;  -- "Rain Man" . . . Dustin Hoffman was good but I never forgot he was Dustin Hoffman. 
Oh well, I shouldn't be too crabby: I've just seen, for the third time, my videotape of a great movie, better than anything in 1988. And the TV miniseries "Lonesome Dove" didn't cost me a nickel.
