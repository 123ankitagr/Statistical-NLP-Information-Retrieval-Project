Although my triple bet didn't get off to a good start, I was still able to come out $2 ahead when Just Deeds finished second in the seventh. It goes to show that picking the right horse is important but so is money management. Today my selection is $10 to win, place and show on Pocket Veto in the fourth race. 
Janice Goldinger's Wed. bankroll: $2,124 
Wednesday's Profit: $2 
Current Bankroll: $2,126 
SURELOCK's exacta came up short Wednesday when Great Communicator came back to show his past class in the eighth. Today's wager is a $10 exacta box, Really Brilliant-Saratogan-Charging Raj, in the eighth race. 
SURELOCK's Wed. bankroll: $760 
Wednesday's Loss: $60 
Current Bankroll: $700 
Note: Janice Goldinger, a horse owner, does not bet on races her horses run in. SURELOCK does not own horses. 
Both players started with a $2,000 bankroll.
