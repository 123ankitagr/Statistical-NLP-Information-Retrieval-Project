Trafalgar House is believed to be in discussions which could result in
Mandarin Oriental, the Hong Kong-based hotel group, managing the Ritz in
London.
Trafalgar House had been hoping to sell the Ritz, but took it off the market
last year when it did not receive what it considered adequate offers.
Trafalgar House and Mandarin Oriental have the same chairman, Mr Simon
Keswick. Jardine Matheson, which controls Mandarin Oriental, is also
Trafalgar's largest shareholder.
Trafalgar House is thought to have concluded that in the absence of a buyer
for the Ritz, the hotel would benefit from Mandarin Oriental's management
and from being part of a larger international hotel marketing network.
Both companies declined to comment.
