SIMSMETAL, an Australian recycling company, has agreed to take control of
the New Zealand operations of Pacific Metal Industries, a Fletcher Challenge
(FCL) subsidiary, for NZDollars 20m (USDollars 10.5m), writes Terry Hall in
Wellington.
The companies will form a 50-50 joint venture which will dominate New
Zealand's recycling of ferrous and non-ferrous materials.
The FCL unit has been the leading ferrous scrap recycler in New Zealand with
an annual throughput of 150,000 tonnes.
The venture, to be known as Sims Pacific Metals, will be contracted to
supply Pacific Steel, the FCL-controlled Auckland iron mill, with raw and
imported materials.
