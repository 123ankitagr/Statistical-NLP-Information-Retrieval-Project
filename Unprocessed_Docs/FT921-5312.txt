ROCHE, the Swiss drug company which is one of the largest and
fastest-growing in the industry, yesterday extended its involvement in
genetic engineering by signing a deal to promote a new cystic fibrosis drug,
DNase, made by Genentech of the US, writes Daniel Green.
DNase should be approved by 1994. Sales could be as high as Dollars 250m a
year, and Roche will develop and promote the drug in Europe.
The deal is the latest in a series following Roche's acquisition two years
ago of a 60 per cent stake in Genentech for Dollars 2.1bn. Genentech was one
of the pioneers in genetic engineering. Last year, Roche paid Dollars 300m
for a genetic engineering production process called PCR developed by Cetus,
a US drug company.
