A three-car collision left one person dead and one injured Friday and forced the closure of Carbon Canyon Road in Brea for 2 hours, backing up rush-hour traffic for several miles, authorities said. 
Alva Svoboda of Brea died at UCI Medical Center in Orange after his car collided head-on with a 29-year-old Chino woman's 1988 Plymouth van at 7:45 a.m., Brea Police Lt. James Winder said.
