One of China's so-called "Special Economic Zones" -- Shenzhen, located next to the Hong Kong border -- will hold a three day, 10th anniversary celebration starting next Monday. 
The commemoration is expected to highlight the zone's rapid growth and to promote its image for potential investors. Coming in the midst of private debates within the Chinese government over the pace and direction of economic reforms, the celebrations appear aimed at defending those gains already made and promoting the case for further change. 
Many of China's economic reforms were pioneered in Shenzhen and other special zones.
