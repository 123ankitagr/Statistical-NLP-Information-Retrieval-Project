I couldn't help gloating when I read Leon Tsao's letter describing his family (Feb. 27). With such phrases as "mongrel bunch," "hybrid vigor in the offspring," and "more fit for survival than the intolerant," Tsao should forever put to rest the myth of the "Aryan master race." To the "Not-sees," Skinheads, Ku Klux Klan, David Duke, and other bigoted, racist know-nothings: "Foiled again!"
