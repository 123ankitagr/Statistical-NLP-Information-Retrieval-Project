Wellman, the specialist engineering company, yesterday announced a
management overhaul as part of its Pounds 46m acquisition of three
subsidiary businesses from FKI, the electrical engineering and components
group.
Geoffrey Iley, the 64-year-old non-executive chairman, said the six-man
Wellman board would be augmented by three new executive directors to oversee
the expansion.
They will be led by Barry Jameson, 49, currently group managing director of
FKI's precision controls division. Jameson, who has overall control of two
of the FKI subsidiaries being sold, has been named managing director of the
transport and technology division at Wellman.
He will be joined on the board by Tony Fletcher, 44, who replaces Jon Smith,
46, as finance director.
Fletcher, who was recruited from his own consultancy business, is a former
finance director and company secretary at Mono Group, the pumps business.
Smith, meanwhile, is to become a divisional finance director within the
Wellman group.
The company has also promoted Roger Hancox, 45, currently managing director
of Wellman Furnaces and Wellman Process Engineering. As a board director, he
will oversee the process engineering division.
The shake-up is thought to have been masterminded by Alan Baxter, who joined
Wellman last November as chief executive.
Baxter, 43, was an FKI director until June 1992.
