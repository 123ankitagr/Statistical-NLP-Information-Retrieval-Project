A man suspected in 15 bank robberies in San Diego County was arrested Monday after he tried to rob an Orange County bank, San Diego police said Tuesday. 
Eric Raymond Martin, 22, of La Mesa, allegedly tried to rob a Tustin bank Monday, but was arrested after a plainclothes detective followed him, said Bill Robinson, a San Diego police spokesman. 
Police have dubbed the robberies the "kangaroo bank robbery series" because the robber put the money in a pouch-like zippered bag at his waist, Robinson said. The robberies were committed between Jan. 27 and April 25, in areas from Coronado to Carlsbad. 
Martin also is suspected of committing four Los Angeles robberies, Robinson said.
