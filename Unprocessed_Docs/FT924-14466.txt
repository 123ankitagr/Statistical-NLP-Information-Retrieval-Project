Sir, Your leader, 'Rational roads' (September 29), makes a good case for
road pricing but misses one key target. The growth in goods traffic by road
is fuelled by the switch to 'just-in-time' manufacturing. A good part of the
benefits of this scheme stem from an outrageous ploy to externalise the
costs of stock holding. Firms are in effect dumping their stock costs on the
street, where congestion and accidents are paid for by other road users.
True economic efficiency calls for fierce charges on goods transport by
road, under the slogan: kanban plus vanban]
