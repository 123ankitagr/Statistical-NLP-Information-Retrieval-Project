No More Love on Radio: Late-night radio talk show host "Mother Love" (Jo Anne Hart) has left KFI-AM to pursue a career in television, though she would not elaborate on the specific television project. Hart hosted a show from 10 p.m. to midnight in which she offered her own blend of street-wise and humorous advice on a host of topics. Friday was Hart's last show but she bid listeners farewell Monday night. Hart will be replaced by marriage and family counselor Laura Schlesinger, who currently has a call-in advice show on KFI-AM on Saturdays and Sundays from 8 p.m. to midnight. CLAUDIA PUIG
