Monday: Figures for M0, the narrowest measure of the money supply, will be
published in the UK. Growth in the 12 months to February is expected to be
5.3 per cent, remaining well above the government's 0-4 per cent monitoring
range. However, low interest rates, which have reduced the effective cost of
holding cash, are blamed for causing a jump in M0 growth.
German money supply figures for M3 are expected to be published ahead of the
Bundesbank council meeting on Thursday. Annualised growth in December was
8.1 per cent, well ahead of the target range, but was dismissed as a
'temporary disturbance' by the bank.
Tuesday: Growth in the US's fourth-quarter GDP could be revised to an even
higher rate than the annualised 5.9 per cent previously estimated. Extensive
construction activity in the Midwest, following the floods, may have pushed
the rate well over 6 per cent.
Wednesday: UK official reserves are expected to have risen by a modest
Dollars 50m in February. The Treasury will release its monthly monetary
report, to coincide with the meeting between the Chancellor and the
Governor.
