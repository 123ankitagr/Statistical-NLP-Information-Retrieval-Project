Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the Japanese prime minister, last night went further
than any western leader in accepting Beijing's intransigent attitude to
criticism of its human rights record, Our Foreign Staff writes. 'According
to the Chinese, the most fundamental human right is to be able to live, not
to die of hunger, to have a house to live in . . . I think it is half true,'
he said.
After much agonising, Japan last month accepted an invitation for Emperor
Akihito to visit China in October. The Emperor is expected to acknowledge
Japanese guilt for wartime brutality, while stopping short of an outright
apology.
