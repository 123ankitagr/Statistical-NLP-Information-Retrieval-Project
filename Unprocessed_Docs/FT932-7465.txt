New Zealand and Australia sought at the weekend to underline their
commitment to co-operation, particularly in trade, after a three-day visit
to New Zealand by Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, writes Terry
Hall in Wellington.
Mr Keating spelled out a vision of 'companionability' for the trading future
between the two countries, adding that the 'main game is our integration in
the Asian-Pacific region'.
On defence, Mr Keating apparently failed to secure agreement for New Zealand
to spend more, and was also unsuccessful in his calls for the country to
patch up its differences on nuclear ship visits with the US under the Anzus
pact.
There was agreement on pensions integration, and the two leaders said they
would facilitate moves on air travel between the two countries to allow
people to use domestic terminals by the end of the year.
