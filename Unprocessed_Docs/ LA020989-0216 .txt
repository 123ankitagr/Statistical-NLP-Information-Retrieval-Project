Braniff Inc. will move its headquarters from Dallas to Orlando beginning in May, Braniff Chairman William McGee announced today. 
The headquarters move had been expected since the airline was purchased by a Philadelphia and New York investment group last summer, and speculation on the location had centered on Kansas City, Mo., and Orlando, where Braniff has hubs. 
"Although Kansas City is and will remain our largest hub, our decision to locate our headquarters here signals our commitment to the growth of central Florida as well," McGee told a news conference in Orlando.
