Crew members of a Russian ship stranded in a Ukrainian port for six months
have run out of food and soon will have no choice but to try to outrun the
Ukrainian coast guard, the ship's captain said yesterday. The Russian ship
Modul was detained by Ukrainian authorities at the Crimean port of
Evpatoria. It has a cargo of 60 tonnes of Ukrainian ammunition for Angola.
But the Ukrainian suppliers wanted the delivery stopped as they had not
received payment from Angola. 'If Moscow and Kiev do not help the Russian
sailors, my crew will only have one option: to try to break past the border
and outrun the Ukrainian coast-guard,' Captain Leonid Volfovsky told a
Russian news agency. He said a Russian official had come on board to try to
resolve the dispute. One solution might be to load the contested cargo on to
another Russian ship.
