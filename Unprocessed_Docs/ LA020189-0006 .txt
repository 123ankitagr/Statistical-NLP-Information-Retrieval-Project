A Greenpeace ship and a Japanese whaling vessel collided off Antarctica in the most serious incident since the environmental group began a campaign a week ago to stop the whale hunt. The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru No. 3 sustained minor damage to its handrails, but the Greenpeace ship Gondwana was not damaged and there were no injuries, Greenpeace spokesman Peter Wilkinson said via radio telephone from the Gondwana to Sydney, Australia. In Sydney, the Greenpeace coordinator for Antarctica, Lyn Goldsworthy, said the Japanese ship had attached a grappling hook to the 1,435-ton Gondwana to pull it out of the way shortly before the collision.
