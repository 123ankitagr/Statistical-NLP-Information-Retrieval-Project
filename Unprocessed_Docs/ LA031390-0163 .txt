Pete Rose, former manager of the Cincinnati Reds, said today he is in no hurry to apply for reinstatement but is eager to get into baseball's Hall of Fame. 
"I'm not worried about getting back in baseball in a non-playing role," Rose said. 
"I'm anticipating the Hall of Fame. You don't need to be reinstated to go to the Hall of Fame." 
Rose, who last played in 1986, will be eligible for election by the baseball writers after the 1991 season. 
Rose was banned from baseball for life Aug. 24 because of illegal gambling activity. 
Attending a charity luncheon of Crossroads Rehabilitation Center here, Rose commented on the contract dispute that threatens the start of the season: "I don't think baseball needs any changes right now because the owners and players are making top dollar and the fans are happy." 
Rose said the loss of the spring training games should not have too much of an effect on the season.
