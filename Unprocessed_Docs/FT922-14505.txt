THE Miss World beauty contest, in exile from its native Britain after being
shunned by television schedulers, has found a new home at Sun City, the
South African hotel and entertainment resort, Michael Skapinker writes.
Mr Sol Kerzner, Sun City's founder and former husband of Miss Anneline
Kriel, a former Miss World, intends to use the internationally televised
contest to attract visitors to Lost City, a new Pounds 150m adjunct to Sun
City.
Located in the arid, nominally independent homeland of Bophuthatswana, many
miles from the nearest ocean, Lost City will feature 'the world's first
man-made rain forest' and a pool with 2 1/2 -metre-high surfing waves. Miss
World will take place in November, shortly before Lost City's opening.
Although Britain's terrestrial television channels no longer regard Miss
World as appropriate family viewing, Mr Kerzner says he expects the
competition to be broadcast to 600m people worldwide.
