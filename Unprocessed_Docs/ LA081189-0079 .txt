A 43-year-old San Diego man died Wednesday night when he was struck by a car in Rancho Penasquitos. 
Charles Francis Goeb was at Stoney Creek Road when he attempted to cross Carmel Mountain Road. He was struck by a northbound car in the 10300 block of Carmel Mountain Road. The car was driven by Patrick J. Moore, 24, of Rancho Penasquitos, said San Diego police spokesman Bill Robinson. 
Moore was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence, Robinson said. 
Moore is being held in County Jail in lieu of $10,000 bail. He is scheduled to be arraigned today. 
Goeb, who died at the scene, is the 24th pedestrian to be killed on San Diego streets this year, Robinson said.
