THE Chinese government has complained to Japan over the arrival in Tokyo
yesterday of Chien Fu, the first Taiwanese foreign minister to visit in two
decades.
Mr Chien has arrived on a tourist visa for a four-day 'private' visit, but
Beijing has taken his presence as an unwelcome sign of a growing Taiwanese
diplomatic profile.
China is concerned that several countries have recently appointed senior
diplomats to head unofficial missions in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, at
the same time as the island's independence movement is gathering momentum.
While Mr Chien is not scheduled formally to meet Japanese government
officials, he is likely to meet senior officials of the ruling Liberal
Democratic party at a parliamentarians' function this evening.
A Japanese government official said China's foreign ministry lodged a
protest with the embassy in Beijing, noting that the issuing of any visa to
Mr Chien is a de facto recognition of his role as foreign minister.
The Nationalist Chinese government in Taiwan still claims to be the
legitimate Chinese government, which makes Mr Chien the 'Chinese foreign
minister'.
However, Beijing regards Taiwan as a rebel province and opposes any foreign
recognition of the island's government.
'We knew that Mr Chien's visit was a sensitive matter for China, but we have
explained to them that this is a private matter and that he is here as a
tourist. We are not surprised that they have complained,' a foreign ministry
official said last night.
The visit by Mr Chien is the first by a Taiwanese foreign minister since
1972, when Japan recognised the government in Beijing and severed links with
Taipei.
Instead of an embassy, Taiwan maintains an 'Economic and Cultural
Representative Office' in Tokyo.
