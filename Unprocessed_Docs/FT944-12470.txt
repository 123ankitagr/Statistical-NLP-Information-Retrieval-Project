The GOLD price slumped to its lowest level in nine weeks yesterday as US
investment funds' patience with the lacklustre market broke in a wave of

An an unusually long London fixing session ended with the price at Dollars
383.75 a troy ounce. It ended at Dollars 384.50, still Dollars 2.40 down
from Friday's close. 'It goes to show that these funds can control this
market completely and there is nothing you can do about it,' one dealer
commented.
London Commodity Exchange COFFEE futures slipped on what traders called a
bearish private forecast for Brazil's 1995-96 crop.
