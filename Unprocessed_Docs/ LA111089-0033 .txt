In response to your editorial ("It's What You Do That Counts," Oct. 31) I commend state Sen. Art Torres and Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alatorre for their courage in accepting their disease (alcoholism) and doing something about it. 
Now more than ever they remain my heroes of politics. They will serve as good role models for young Chicanos in the barrios and wherever alcohol is prevalent. If Chicanos win the war on drugs and alcohol then nothing can stop them from achieving success in life.
