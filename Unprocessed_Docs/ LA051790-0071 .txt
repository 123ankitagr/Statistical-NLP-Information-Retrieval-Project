This week we introduce a new bimonthly column by Marion Cunningham, America's most beloved homecook.  A native of Los Angeles, Cunningham married her childhood sweetheart, raised two children and never left the state of California until she was 45. 
It was then that she was given her first airplane ticket and the chance to go to Portland to cook with James Beard. She ultimately became his assistant.  When Beard was later asked who could revise the "Fanny Farmer Cookbook," he suggested Cunningham. She spent four years writing the 12th revision and then wrote the "Fanny Farmer Baking Book." Two years ago she published "The Breakfast Book." She has just completed an entirely new revision of Fanny Farmer, and has started work on "The Supper Book."  What makes Cuningham so refreshing is her very American take on cooking. She's a great cook who makes simple, tasty food. She's the mother we all wish we had -- her cupboard is full of cookies and there's something wonderful on her table, every night, for dinner.
