The following is a summary of Southern California-related business litigation developments during the week of April 23: 
Fox Sued Over Manson Interview: Fox Broadcasting Co. was sued in Los Angeles Superior Court by Nikolas Schrenk, who claims Fox failed to get approval before using parts of his 1988 interview with convicted killer Charles Manson. 
The breach-of-contract suit alleges that Fox agreed Schrenk would approve its use of any footage from the Manson interview, broadcast in mid-1989 on "A Current Affair." Schrenk seeks unstated damages for revenue allegedly lost from expected sales of videotapes and other TV broadcasts of the interview. (Filed April 23, 1990. Case No. C759166)
