Carre Otis, co-star of the steamy new film "Wild Orchid," is suing the movie's producers, alleging that they gave Playboy magazine nude photographs of her without her consent. 
The lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, states that the contract Otis signed with Kruger-Brent Group in April, 1989, stipulated that the actress "shall have approval over still photographs for the pictures in which artist appears nude or partially nude." 
Besides Kruger-Brent, the suit names as defendants Brazil Star Films; Vision P.D.G., which guaranteed the contract between Kruger-Brent and Otis; and Vision International, the firms' parent company. 
"We haven't seen the suit, so we can't make any comment," Vision Chairman Mark Damon said today. 
Filed Thursday, the suit says photographs of nude scenes in the movie appear in June's Playboy and appeared in the April edition of the German magazine Kino.
