Two New Zealand-based companies have expressed interest in buying the 82 per
cent stake in New Zealand Light Leathers put on the market by the UK company
Strong and Fisher (Holdings) last week, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
Strong and Fisher said it was selling its shares in New Zealand Light
Leathers because it wanted to focus on its UK operations. The remaining 18
per cent is still listed on the New Zealand Stock Exchange.
The shares were bought by Strong and Fisher in 1988 and have a market value
of about NZDollars 6.8m based on the last traded price of NZDollars 1.40. In
1988, the shares were selling at about 70 cents.
