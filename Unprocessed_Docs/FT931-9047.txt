The US President's Day holiday tended to restrict interest on the LME, where
most prices moved lower. Three-month COPPER traded in a softer range,
encountering support near Dollars 2,220 a tonne, where Chinese buying is
expected, and running into overhead resistance around Dollars 2,231.
Three-month ALUMINIUM gradually lost ground in the afternoon, after heavy
midsession buying interest around Dollars 1,220 faded. Prices now look set
to test strong support around Dollars 1,215.
