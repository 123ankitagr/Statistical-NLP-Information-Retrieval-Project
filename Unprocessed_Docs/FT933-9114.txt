ESTONIA'S state court ruled yesterday that a referendum on autonomy
organised by the local council in the north-eastern town of Narva, which is
dominated by ethnic Russians, was not constitutional, Reuter reports from
Tallinn.
Mr Kait Maruste, court chairman, said local councils such as Narva's have no
power to deal with issues of national interest.
'A town council can deal with local issues only. The town council referendum
on the ethnic-territorial issue is. . . unconstitutional.'
