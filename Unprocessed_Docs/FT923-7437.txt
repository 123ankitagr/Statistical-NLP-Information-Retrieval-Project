THREE NEW York commodities exchanges have agreed on a plan to build a new
headquarters and trading facility in lower Manhattan.
The Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, the Commodity Exchange (Comex), and
the New York Cotton Exchange have approved a plan that will cost about
Dollars 150m and be funded through a combination of private finance and the
New York city and state money.
City and state funding has been offered because the project is expected to
keep some 9,000 jobs in New York. The New York State Urban Development
Corporation will invest Dollars 27m and New York city will provide a Dollars
26m grant. The city will also provide a Dollars 22m capital contribution
which will be recouped through a combination of enhanced rent and payments
in lieu of taxes.
The new seven-storey building will have 51,000 sq ft of column-free trading
floor, more than twice the size of the floor in the World Centre, which the
three exchanges share at present with the New York Mercantile Exchange, the
largest New York market.
Nymex will not be following its neighbours to their new home, but will look
for its own new trading space independently. It has favoured New Jersey as a
location.
