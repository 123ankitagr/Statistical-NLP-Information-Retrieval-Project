Former Mayor Edward I. Koch takes on old foes with his customary vitriol in a collection of letters and newspaper columns from his 12-year reign. 
"Always give as good as you get," Koch wrote his successor, David Dinkins, who defeated him last year. 
That letter is one of several in "All the Best: Letters from a Feisty Mayor," due out in April. 
On the scandals that shook his third term, Koch wrote to Dinkins, "The most searing pain of my twelve years was learning I had been betrayed by people who were corrupt. 
"I was despondent. I must confess, on several occasions when I was alone, I wept. It was hard to get myself out of bed in the morning."
