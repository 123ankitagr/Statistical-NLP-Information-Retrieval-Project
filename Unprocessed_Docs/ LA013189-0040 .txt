Pakistani government officials are said to be proposing a swap that would send U.S.-made nuclear reactors to their country in exchange for safeguards to assure that the country's nuclear program is used only for peaceful purposes. Rep. Stephen J. Solarz (D-N.Y.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Asian subcommittee, said such an agreement could head off a showdown later this year on a cutoff of U.S. aid to Pakistan over its failure to comply with nuclear non-proliferation requirements. "If the United States is willing to sell nuclear reactors for peaceful nuclear energy, Pakistan would agree to establish full-scope safeguards on all their nuclear facilities," said Solarz, who recently visited Pakistan.
