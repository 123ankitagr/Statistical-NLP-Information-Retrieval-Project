Six people were crushed to death in Hong Kong and five were injured when a concrete building ledge crashed to the pavement, police said Saturday. It took firefighters about an hour to free those trapped beneath the 32-yard-long, 3-yard-wide ledge after it fell from an industrial building on the Kowloon peninsula Friday evening.
