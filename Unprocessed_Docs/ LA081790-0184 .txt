Texas House Speaker Gib Lewis says he strongly opposes the University of Texas or Texas A&M leaving the Southwest Conference. 
He vowed "to do everything in my power to prevent it from happening" -- even slashing appropriations to the two universities. 
For fiscal 1991, the Legislature appropriated $233 million to Texas and $183 million to A&M -- none of it for athletics. 
Lewis, a Ft. Worth Democrat, also said he would form a special House study group to look into the potential ramifications.
