Sir, Many football supporters, and perhaps some managers, might occasionally
recognise Observer's description of some football players as intangible
assets ('Numbers game', October 7).
However, the assertion that investors 'own' 197p of players for each share
seems to contravene the anti-slavery laws, where it becomes illegal for one
person to 'own' another person. A great deal of the impetus for human asset
accounting failed the anti-slavery test.
The whole contract-transfer system in football should also be abolished,
freeing players to sell themselves in this labour market and encouraging
employers to have less ownership and perhaps more respect for the players.
