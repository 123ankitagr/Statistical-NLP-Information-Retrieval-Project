Warning notices are to be posted in mountain blackspots in Scotland telling
holidaymakers and casual walkers how many people have died in the area.
The shock tactic was announced by the Scottish Mountain Safety Group as
rescue teams prepared for their busiest period, when many poorly-equipped
walkers get into trouble.
The signs advise walkers on equipment and precautions they should take
before walking in the hills. On a busy summer day up to 500 people may climb
Ben Nevis, Britain's highest mountain. Ten people died on Scotland's
mountains and hills last summer.
