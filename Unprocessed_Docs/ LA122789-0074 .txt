A dozen Minnesota and Wisconsin Boy Scouts will leave for Costa Rica Saturday to participate in a sea turtle rescue project. 
The scouts, ages 13 to 17, and three adult leaders will join Costa Rican Boy Scouts in patrolling a 5-mile-long beach on the west coast of the Nicoya Peninsula to protect the turtles' eggs from poachers.
