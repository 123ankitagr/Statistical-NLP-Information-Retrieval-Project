Boyd P. (Bud) Welin, civic activist, former mayor of Pasadena and a lifelong supporter of USC, has died at his Laguna Hills home, USC officials announced this week. 
Welin, who with his late wife established a professorship in pharmaceutical sciences at USC in 1988, was 85 when he died June 14. 
A pharmacist who graduated from USC in 1927, Welin was a former member of the USC Board of Trustees and past president of the General Alumni Assn. He co-founded the Brown and Welin Prescription Pharmacists firm in Pasadena after Army service in World War II and owned it solely from 1969 to 1979, when he sold it. 
He was mayor of Pasadena from 1966 until he resigned in 1968, citing the press of business.
