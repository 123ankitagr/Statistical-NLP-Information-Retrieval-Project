NEARLY Pounds 1m is to be spent on developing a tourism and environment
centre around a mountain surrounded by Army observation posts in Northern
Ireland.
The International Fund for Ireland, the EC and the Department of Agriculture
(NI) will provide the Pounds 900,000 to fund the centre over the next two
years.
The project will be around the Slieve Gullion mountain between Newry and
Forkhill in south Armagh, and will include self-catering accommodation,
commercial rental premises as well as a restaurant.
