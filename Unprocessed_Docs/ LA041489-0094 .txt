Deion Sanders, former Florida State football and baseball star, has chosen football over baseball. 
Sanders, playing minor league baseball in the New York Yankee organization, said he will cut short his baseball season to play in the National Football League. 
The Arizona Republic reported that the Phoenix Cardinals are trying to make a deal to move up in the draft so that they can select Sanders.
