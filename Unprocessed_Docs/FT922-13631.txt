THE RACE to create a debt rating market in Spain intensified yesterday when
Standard & Poor's, the US rating agency, entered into a partnership with the
local stock markets, and two official credit institutions, Instituto de
Credito Oficial (ICO) and the export credit guarantor, CESCE, writes Peter
Bruce in Madrid.
Efforts to begin Spanish rating operations began after the amount of
corporate paper in circulation rose more than 300 per cent to about Dollars
21bn by the beginning of last year. There are, currently, about 55 issues
outstanding, making Spain one of the most active corporate debt markets in
Europe.
Mr Leo O'Niell, S&P's president and chief rating officer, said that in spite
of the rapid growth of corporate paper issues - caused largely by Bank of
Spain lifting borrowing restrictions more than two years ago, Spain was a
good long-term proposition.
