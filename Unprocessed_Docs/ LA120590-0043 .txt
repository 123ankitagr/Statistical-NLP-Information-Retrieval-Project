A municipal court judge in Victorville on Tuesday ordered a La Canada Flintridge man to stand trial in the murder of his wife, whose charred body was found Sept. 13 in a remote desert area west of Victorville. 
Judge John B. Gibson ordered Donald Miralle, 46, bound over for trial after a two-day preliminary hearing in which prosecutors presented evidence that tread marks and footprints found near the body matched tires and tennis shoes owned by Miralle. 
Tessie Miralle, 49, disappeared after she went to her husband's office in Pasadena on Sept. 12. Her body was discovered while it was still burning early the next morning. Defense attorneys challenged the identity of the body and said all of the evidence linking Don Miralle to the crime is circumstantial.
