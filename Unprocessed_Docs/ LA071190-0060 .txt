A member of an El Salvador military intelligence unit linked to the murders of Jesuit priests in that country was arrested in Long Beach on Tuesday in the midst of a visit during which he planned to testify about the killings, activists said. 
Cesar Vielman Joya-Martinez, 28, employed as a construction worker in the beach city, was arrested by Immigration and Naturalization Service agents on federal charges of illegally entering the United States after being deported on the same charge seven years ago. 
Activists seeking an end to U.S. involvement in El Salvador were trying to set up interviews between Joya-Martinez and a congressional committee investigating alleged death squad activity in the Central American country.
