THE radical right-wing in Germany now presents as big a threat to internal
security as left-wing urban guerrillas did in the 1970s, the government said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Bonn.
At least 4,400 of the 40,000 right-wing extremists in Germany are prone to
violence and some may want to stockpile weapons for possible terrorist
attacks, it said in answer to a query in parliament.
Skinheads make up 4,200 of the 4,400 violent right-wingers identified by
Bonn's internal security watchdog, the Federal Office for the Protection of
the Constitution (BFV). The Ku Klux Klan from the US was also active in
providing neo-Nazi propaganda, the government said.
