Pacific Rim Conference Set: San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge symbolizes the gateway to the Pacific, was chosen to host a major trade and finance symposium expected to attract about 1,000 business and political leaders from Pacific Rim nations. Mayor Art Agnos said the 1990 Pacific Rim Conference was "a real coup" for San Francisco and would help establish the Bay Area as a major U.S. "hub" of commerce for an economically powerful Asia-Pacific region that encompasses 57 countries and 2.4 billion people. The first Pacific Rim Conference was held in Perth, Western Australia, in November, 1986.
