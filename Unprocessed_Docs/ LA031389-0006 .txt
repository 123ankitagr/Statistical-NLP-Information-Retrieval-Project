Thousands of armed police and Chinese troops patrolled the riot-scarred streets of the Tibetan capital, checking identification cards and making arrests, sources in Lhasa said. Reached by telephone from Beijing, the sources said there was no overt evidence of anti-Chinese unrest in Lhasa as security forces maintained an iron grip on the city during its fifth day under martial law. Residents and foreign travelers have placed the number of arrests since the imposition of martial law at more than 1,000. The decree was imposed after three days of rioting by Tibetans.
