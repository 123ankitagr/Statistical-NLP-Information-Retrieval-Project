SPEED LIMITS are to be cut to 20mph on more residential roads after pilot
schemes led to a sharp fall in accidents, the government said yesterday.
Mr Robert Key, the roads minister, said at the launch of a road safety
campaign in London that there was evidence slowing down saved lives.
Officials monitoring 60 experimental schemes involving road calming and
20mph zones found child deaths had fallen by 80 per cent in accidents where
pedestrians and cyclists were hit by cars.
The overall number of casualties in traffic accidents was down 70 per cent,
statistics compiled by the Department of Transport's Traffic Research
Laboratory show.
Last year 44,186 children were involved in road accidents, however, and
Britain's child pedestrian death rate is still one of the highest in Europe.
