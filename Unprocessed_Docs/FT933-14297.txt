A SENIOR TUC official yesterday called for a world-wide council of Hanson
Corporation union representatives.
Mr David Lea, TUC assistant general secretary, made the call at a rally to
support miners on strike against the Hanson subsidiary Peabody, the biggest
coal producer in the USA. He said: 'Unions in Europe are beginning to set up
councils for multinational companies. It is high time that we had a council
for the Hanson unions.'
