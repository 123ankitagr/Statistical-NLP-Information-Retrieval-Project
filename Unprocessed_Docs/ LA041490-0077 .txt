Thomas Delahanty, a police officer shot during John W. Hinckley Jr.'s attempt to assassinate former President Ronald Reagan, may not sue the maker of Hinckley's Saturday Night Special handgun, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. 
The decision upholds a lower court ruling. Hinckley was acquitted of the March 30, 1981, assassination attempt by using an insanity defense and remains in a Washington mental hospital.
