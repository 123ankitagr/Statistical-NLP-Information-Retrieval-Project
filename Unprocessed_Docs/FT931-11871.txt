UNION leaders representing UK and Norwegian offshore oil workers announced
yesterday they are to forge an alliance.
Mr Ronnie McDonald, general secretary of the 2,500-strong OILC union, headed
the British side in talks with their Norwegian counterparts represented by
the OFS union.
The two unions will together initially represent around 9,000 workers,
becoming the largest union voice in the North Sea.
