I write to express my gratitude and appreciation for your readers of whom I am proud to be one. 
I was amazed and not a little disgusted at your giving a podium to Nixon and my final impulse was to say so. 
Then I thought of the wonderful letters writers and knew I could depend on them to come through once again. 
I was rewarded, more than I ever imagined -- 63 anti- and only two pro-Nixon letters! Wonderful! 
I hope you are properly chastened.
