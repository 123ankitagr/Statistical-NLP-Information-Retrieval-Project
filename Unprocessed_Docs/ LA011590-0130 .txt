Rock superstar Bruce Springsteen and his girlfriend, Patti Scialfa, are expecting a baby, USA Today reported today. 
USA Today said Columbia Records confirmed the pregnancy but did not say when the baby is due or whether the couple will marry. 
Officials at New York-based Columbia Records could not be immediately reached for comment today; the telephone was answered with a recording because of the Martin Luther King holiday. Springsteen's manager, Jon Landau, did not immediately return a call seeking comment. 
Springsteen, 40, and Scialfa, his former backup singer, revealed their romance publicly in the spring of 1988, after Springsteen and his wife, actress Julianne Phillips, split up. He had married Phillips in 1985; the couple had no children. 
Springsteen is known for such hits as "Born in the U.S.A.," "Hungry Heart" and "Born to Run."
