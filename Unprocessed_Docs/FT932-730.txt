SOME OF YOU may be wondering how the Browns/FT fashion workshops went. Well,
they seemed to be a huge success. In the end we held two as the first was
over-subscribed by the first post. For me it was lovely to meet so many
readers - and it was particularly rewarding that so many came from outside
London. Everybody I spoke to enjoyed seeing what some of our designers are
up to, to see just how a fine jacket can be made to work for its price-tag
and how a suit can be worn in many different moods. It was extraordinary to
hear so many lovely women say that they felt so diffident about their
wardrobes, but it was good to feel that we gave them the confidence to
experiment. The clothes were shown on the Browns' staff who, like women
everywhere, came short and tall, skinny and Junoesque - but all looked
terrific. This, we hope, is what the evening did - encouraged every woman
there to find her own style and to realise that perfect bodies exist only in
glossy magazines. The rest of us can look good, too. We may do it again this
autumn - and possibly something for the chaps - so watch this space.
