Wall Street
A LATE ROUND of computer-driven sell programmes pushed US equity prices
sharply lower on a day in which the market had largely held its own in spite
of an erosion in IBM''s share price, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 22.42 lower at 3,310.84 after
gaining more than 18 points in the afternoon. The more broadly based
Standard & Poor's 500 fell 1.17 to 437.98, while the Amex composite was down
0.35 at 393.83. The Nasdaq composite, however, climbed 2.76 to 669.01.
Trading volume on the New York SE was more than 215m shares, and rises
outnumbered declines by 988 to 825.
On Monday, the Dow had closed 7.02 higher at 3,33.26 on thin volume.
Wall Street's morning buoyancy was the result of several factors including
better-than-expected existing home sales for November, a strong consumer
confidence index and end-of-year window dressing by money managers.
The consumer confidence index for December rose to 78.3 from 65.6 in
November, while the National Association of Realtors said existing home
sales rose 5.8 per cent in November. In addition, the last week of the year
is traditionally a strong period for the stock market. IBM fell Dollars 2 to
Dollars 49 3/4 in active trading after Merrill Lynch cut its long-term
investment rating on the stock to 'above average' from 'buy'.
The Dow also came under pressure from heavy selling in Minnesota Mining &
Manufacturing, attributed to profit taking. The issue closed Dollars 2 3/4
lower at Dollars 100 1/8
Among other active blue chips, AT&T added Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 52 1/4 , a
52-week high. Philip Morris lost Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 77 7/8 and Disney
fell Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 44 1/8 .
Shares in Tiffany, the up-market US jeweller, soared Dollars 3 5/8 to
Dollars 33 1/8 on news that several analysts had upgraded investment
ratings. On Monday, Tiffany reported an 8 per cent rise in sales for the
eight week holiday period.
Shares in Cordis, a company which makes specialised medical devices, climbed
Dollars  5/8 to a 52-week high of Dollars 36 3/8 . The Food & Drug
Administration approved US marketing of the company's Sleuth XT and PTCA
Dilation Catheters.
News that the FDA had approved the marketing of taxol, a promising new
cancer drug derived from the Pacific yew tree, helped shares in
Bristol-Myers advance Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 68 1/2 . Bristol-Myers has
received permission to market taxol to women with ovarian cancer who have
failed to respond to chemotherapy.
Canada
TORONTO ended little changed in active trading boosted by a large block
trade in International Verifact Inc. shares.
Based on preliminary data, the 300 composite index was down 5.04 points, or
0.15 per cent, to 3,314.87, with advances leading declines 316 to 223.
Volume rose to 40.83m shares compared with 16,01m at Thursday's half-day
session. Canadian markets were closed Friday and Monday for the Christmas
and Boxing Day holidays.
