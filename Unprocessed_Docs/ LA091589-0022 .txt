Fellow citizens of the peninsula, wake up! We don't have to be just "sleeping sheep." This citizen attended the Palos Verdes Peninsula Unified School Board meeting on Aug. 21, 1989, which dragged on until 1 a.m. I waited patiently about five hours to comment on the proposal to give our current superintendent of schools another assistant. 
When I attempted to develop a little background on why this additional layer of bureaucracy should not be needed if Jack Price would just do his paid job for the school district, this citizen was told that the tone of his comments was out of order and to step down. As a Southern gentleman who speaks in plain and direct language, I sincerely apologize if the board felt that my comments were a personal attack upon the superintendent. However, I do believe that my comments as a taxpaying citizen should be heard. 
School district enrollment has declined by 25% since Jack Price came here in 1983; yet, his salary has increased by 34% with another raise due any time, retroactive to July 1. Why should a district with declining enrollment need another assistant superintendent? 
I suggest that you go to a school board meeting and judge for yourself. We citizens have an opportunity to elect three new board members this November. Any citizen who takes the time to get informed and vote will never be called a "sleeping sheep."
