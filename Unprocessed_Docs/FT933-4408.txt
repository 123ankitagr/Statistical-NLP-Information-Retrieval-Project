SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North
Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with
Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks over inspection of
its nuclear facilities, but later added preconditions for the meeting it had
proposed for tomorrow.
It demanded Seoul stop its support for international efforts to force
nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to
its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. South Korea rejected
the conditions.
The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if it did not
make progress in nuclear inspection negotiations.
