Actress Doris Day is returning to acting after a 17-year hiatus from television. 
Day signed a multipicture deal with ABC Productions to star in TV movies that will air on ABC-TV, the studio disclosed this week. The contract calls for her to star in three TV films a year as a recurring character. 
The character was still in the planning stages. 
Production is expected to begin at the end of the year, with three movies to be televised during the 1991-92 season. 
Day has appeared in more than 40 motion pictures, the last being the comedy "With Six You Get Egg Roll" in 1968. Her last TV series was a comedy, "The Doris Day Show," in 1968-73.
