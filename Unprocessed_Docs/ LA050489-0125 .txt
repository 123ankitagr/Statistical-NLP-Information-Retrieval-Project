Trek Talk: Actor-director William Shatner promises that Trekkies devoted to the original 1966 "Star Trek" TV series will find plenty to like about "Star Trek V: The Final Frontier," scheduled for release June 9. "It harks back to what I liked best in the old 'Star Trek' series, and that is the action and the adventure and the interplay between the characters," says Shatner, 58, who co-wrote the script, directed the film and reprised his role as the intrepid James T. Kirk. Shatner says that compared to the other "Star Trek" movies, "this picture is rougher and louder and faster -- there's more of an energy permeating the film." ALEENE MacMINN
