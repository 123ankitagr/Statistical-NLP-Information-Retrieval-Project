AMERICAN Express, the US-based financial services group, reported record
sales of its travellers cheques. In the period January to August this year,
US dollar cheque sales were up 29 per cent and sterling cheques up 14 per
cent on the same period last year.
The company said recent shifts in the dollar exchange rate and a change in
consumers' attitude to debt were partly responsible for the increase in
sales.
