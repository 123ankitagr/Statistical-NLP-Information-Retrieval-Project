Moody's Investors Service has upgraded New Zealand's foreign currency debt
rating to AA2 from AA3, Reuter reports from New York. About USDollars 7.8bn
(Pounds 5.2bn) of long-term debt is affected.
Not only had New Zealand's foreign currency debt/exports ratio been
declining rapidly, but this ratio was expected to continue falling over the
next several years, Moody's said. It also expected New Zealand's current
account and government budget deficit to move into surplus.
It seemed almost certain that important political realignments would occur
within New Zealand as a result of the adoption of a 'mixed member
proportional' electoral system (MMP), but these should continue to reflect
the underlying support for the overall reform process.
New Zealand should hold a referendum on abandoning the British crown as head
of state, Prime Minister Jim Bolger said in Blenheim yesterday, AP reports.
He wants the country to become a republic by the year 2000.
