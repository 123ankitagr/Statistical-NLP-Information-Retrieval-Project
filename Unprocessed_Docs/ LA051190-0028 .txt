Commercial fishermen would be banned from catching white croaker in certain areas of San Pedro and Santa Monica bays under legislation approved 38 to 0 Thursday by the state Senate. 
The measure, by Sen. Herschel Rosenthal (D-Los Angeles), would not affect sportfishermen and party boats run by commercial enterprises, which generally do not go into the areas that would be closed off, a Rosenthal aide said. 
The state Department of Health Services in 1985 determined that consuming white croaker caught near the White Point sewage outfall off the Palos Verdes shelf, in Santa Monica Bay or near the Palos Verdes Peninsula could pose a health hazard. Particularly high levels of DDT and PCBs were found in white croaker.
