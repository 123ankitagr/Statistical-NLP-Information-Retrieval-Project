Amid much razzmatazz the prosaically named Milk Marketing Board has
announced that when its 60-year-old statutory monopoly ends some time next
year the new co-operative to arise from the ashes will be known as Milk
Marque.
The board must have a lotta bottle to choose a name based on a French word.
Perhaps it felt it had to butter up to the EC's single market. Whatever the
reason, the new name sounds gibberish.
