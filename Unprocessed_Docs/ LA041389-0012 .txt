The Supreme Court's abortion ruling did not occur in a vacuum. It followed the turbulent 1960s, in which many standards for right and wrong were jettisoned in favor of a "do your own thing" mentality. 
Just as the "me decade" inevitably followed the repeal of a moral code, so did legalized abortion result from this new emphasis on self. Divorces skyrocketed, venereal diseases became epidemic, drugs began killing our children and trashing our cities, pornography moved out of darkened pool halls to foul the mainstream, ethics were regularly violated in high places. Having abandoned our compass, our ship lost direction and ran aground, like the Exxon tanker in Alaska, spewing forth cultural pollution that has yet to be cleaned up. 
This debate is not about how many people each side can put in the streets, how much money the abortion industry can spend on newspaper and television ads or how many lawyers can file amicus briefs. It is about right and wrong.
