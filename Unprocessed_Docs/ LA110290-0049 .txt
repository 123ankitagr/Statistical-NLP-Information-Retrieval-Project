El Dorado High School's football players finally got a league victory to go with their bumps and bruises. 
El Dorado's 28-10 victory over visiting Katella Thursday night at Valencia High was the school's first in an Empire League game in two years. 
"We've been doing the same things all year," El Dorado Coach Rick Jones said. "But we've been doing it at a new intensity level lately." 
To make the playoffs, El Dorado (2-7, 1-3 in league) must beat Los Alamitos next week and Cypress and Katella (2-7, 2-2) must both lose. 
El Dorado sophomore Bryan Warner rushed for 171 yards and two touchdowns in 28 carries, and also scored on a 65-yard pass play from Jason Bluth. 
Bluth threw for 202 yards and two touchdowns, completing nine of 13 passes. A senior, Bluth was the quarterback on last year's 0-10 Hawk team. 
"It was a long time coming," Bluth said. "We worked hard and it finally paid off." 
Bluth's confidence has been building each game. 
"When you talk about evolution, Darwin has nothing on Jason," Jones said. "He is developing into a great leader and an outstanding quarterback." STUART MATTHEWS
