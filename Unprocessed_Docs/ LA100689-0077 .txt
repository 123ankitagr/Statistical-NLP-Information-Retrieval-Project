A charter plane will fly 120 Vietnamese refugees from Hong Kong to Hanoi next week, the third such flight carrying voluntary returnees in eight months, the government announced Thursday. 
Officials said they could not give the exact number of returnees because some might withdraw at the last minute. 
So far, only 263 "boat people" have returned home since a voluntary repatriation scheme run by the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees began in March.
