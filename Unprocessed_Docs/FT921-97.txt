IN AN unusual attempt to influence public policy, some 100 leading US
economists, including six Nobel prizewinners, yesterday demanded immediate
action to stimulate the US economy.
In an open letter to President Bush, members of Congress and Mr Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, the economists called for:
A further cut in interest rates by the Fed;
More federal assistance to states and localities of at least Dollars 50bn;
The restoration of an investment tax credit to encourage spending on new
plant and machinery.
The group, led by Nobel laureates Robert Solow of MIT and James Tobin of
Yale University, said the US economy faced two problems: shortage of demand
and, longer-term, the need to increase productivity growth, which had
slumped since the early 1970s. The measures advocated would help solve both
problems.
Income tax cuts advocated by many congressmen were 'exactly the wrong
approach.'
