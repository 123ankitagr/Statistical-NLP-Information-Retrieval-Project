Paul Carpenter, a former legislative leader convicted of shaking down special interests for campaign contributions, was sentenced today to 12 years in federal prison. 
U.S. District Judge Edward Garcia, rejecting the prosecutor's request for a 15-year term, said Carpenter will be eligible for parole in four years. 
Garcia also refused a defense request that Carpenter be given probation and required to perform community service. 
The silver-haired Carpenter, 62, stood silently while sentence was pronounced by Garcia, who described the evidence against him as "overwhelming." The judge said he selected the 12-year sentence to punish Carpenter and to deter others. 
Carpenter was convicted in September of engaging in racketeering, extortion and conspiracy. Prosecutors said he used his former Senate office to extract campaign contributions from special interests.
