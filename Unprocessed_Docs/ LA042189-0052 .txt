Monroe High took advantage of four Grant errors in the first three innings to score three unearned runs and build a lead that proved insurmountable in a 6-1 win Thursday in a Valley Pac-8 Conference game at Monroe. 
The miscues started early for Grant (10-4, 7-3 in the East Valley League), which Wednesday had defeated Monroe, 5-2, with the help of Viking errors. 
Monroe's first batter, Ernie Echeveste, hit a routine grounder that rolled between first baseman Raul Montero's legs. 
Tony Rolando, who was two for four, then tripled to right field, scoring Echeveste. Rolando scored three pitches later on Tim Costic's ground out to give Monroe a 2-0 lead. 
After Grant scored in the second on a run-scoring single by Stan Spancer, the Lancers gave away two more runs on two third-inning errors to fall behind, 4-1. 
"Those four errors killed us," Grant Coach Tom Lucero said. "We made those errors at very crucial times and just gave them runs. I just don't understand it." 
Monroe pitcher Sean Henson (3-3) pitched well with the lead, scattering seven hits and walking only one. 
"I was tired the whole game," said Henson, who struck out only two. "I knew Grant would hit me, but with the lead I told myself to just take it easy and keep the ball low and I'd be OK." 
Monroe (9-5, 7-3 in the Mid-Valley League) added a run in the fifth. Josh Lawrence squeezed home John Langley, who had tripled. 
The Vikings scored their final run in the sixth after three walks loaded the bases. Adam Clark hit a sacrifice fly to drive in David Van Gorder, who was pinch-running for Henson.
