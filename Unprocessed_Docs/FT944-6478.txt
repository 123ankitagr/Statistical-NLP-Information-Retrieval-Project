Efforts by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) to secure enough foreign
listings to form a special 'Asian board' within its local stock market took
another step forward yesterday when Pearl River Tyre, a Chinese tyre
business, announced plans for a ADollars 45.2m (USDollars 33.4m) share
offering.
Pearl River is a Bermuda-based company formed to hold a 70 per cent interest
in Guangzhou Pearl River Tyre. GPRT, in turn, is based in Guangdong province
and makes tyres for buses and other commercial vehicles. The remaining 30
per cent of GPRT is owned by Guangzhou city, which was formerly the sole
ultimate owner of the tyre business.
Pearl River is planning to sell 45.2m shares at ADollars 1 each. This stock
will represent 86 per cent of the company's issued capital, and the balance
will be held by the government of Guangzhou and professional advisers
involved in the transaction. A group of Malaysian businessmen has already
agreed to subscribe for some 18.4m shares, and a similar amount has been
placed with international institutional investors. This leaves about 10m
shares available for the general public.
The money raised will be used to double the company's production capacity by
1997, from about 1m tyres a year at present.
Sales in 1994 are expected to be about ADollars 60m.
The listing, which is expected to take place early in 1995, will mean that
about half a dozen 'China concept' stocks trade on the ASX, with Pearl River
being the largest.
