Would the United States send troops to defend a country where women are classed as equal to cattle and horses; where teen vandals often are punished by severing their fingers; where Christians are seldom trusted and Jews are hated; where democracy is a dirty word? The country I refer to is Saudi Arabia. Of course, Iraq is guilty of these human-rights transgressions and much more.
