Waylon Jennings is confident his 10-city concert tour with Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson and Willie Nelson will "breathe new life into us." 
The country music stars, who have recorded two albums as the "Highwaymen," open their first joint tour this month in Houston. 
"I think we're going to find when we get through doing this, that it's going to breathe new life into us," Jennings told reporters Thursday. 
Kristofferson said he hopes the tour can eventually go overseas. 
"We want to take this all over the world -- play Moscow, Berlin, Sydney . . . Tokyo," he said. 
Their first album, "Highwayman," released in 1985, has sold more than 1 million copies, and "Highwayman 2" was released this week.
