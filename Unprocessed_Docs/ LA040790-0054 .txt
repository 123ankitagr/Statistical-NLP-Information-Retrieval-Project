I found USC football Coach Larry Smith's concern regarding junior football players leaving school for jobs in the NFL interesting. May I respectfully suggest he need not worry about these young men, but rather he should concern himself with the large number of scholarship football players at USC who leave after their senior years, without degrees and without jobs?
