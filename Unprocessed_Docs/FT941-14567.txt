China's advertising industry had a good year in 1993, with spending 40 per
cent up on 1992 in an otherwise flat world market, Saatchi & Saatchi's
Beijing representative said yesterday, Reuter reports from Hong Kong. Real
advertising growth is expected to continue at 40 per cent for China in 1994,
though rates are likely to decline.
