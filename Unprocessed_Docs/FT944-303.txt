Copper prices, already boosted by strong industrial demand, traded at their
highest level for nearly six years in London as speculative buyers took
advantage of thin end-of-year business to push the market above Dollars
3,000 a tonne. Prices touched Dollars 3,022, 2 per cent up from
pre-Christmas levels and the highest since April 1989, before closing at
Dollars 3,012, up Dollars 18. Demand is forecast to grow by more than 3 per
cent next year but copper stocks should fall because no new mine or refinery
output will be on stream until the second half of 1995. Commodities, Page 21
