GOODMAN Fielder, the Australasian food group, is to buy a 50 per cent
interest in Goody Foods, a privately-owned Taiwanese manufacturer of frozen
Chinese pastry products.
Goodman (formerly Goodman Fielder Wattie), would not reveal the purchase
price, but the deal is believed to be worth more than ADollars 20m
(USDollars 13.5m).
Goody Foods, established in 1979 by Mr Hector Yeh, controls about 25 per
cent of the ADollars 170m Taiwanese market for flour-based prepared foods.
Goodman said it expected the market to be worth ADollars 500m a year by
2000.
Goody employs about 700 in two factories producing six product lines under
Dragon and Phoenix brands.
Its products are also sold in Japan, Korea, Europe and the US.
Mr Michael Nugent, Goodman chief executive, said Goody was 'a very good fit'
with Goodman's cereal-based businesses.
He said the investment would enhance the group's knowledge of Asian markets.
'Goody Foods' excellent distribution network also offers opportunities to
market Goodman Fielder products in Taiwan. In addition, this venture will
offer a good bridge to the Chinese market,' Mr Nugent said.
Goodman has said it planned to spend ADollars 200m on expanding its Asian
operations.
