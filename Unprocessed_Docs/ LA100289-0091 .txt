To speed police and fire response times, Huntington Beach officials will start enforcing a law requiring homes and businesses to make their addresses visible from the street. 
"We have a lot of problems with our larger (apartment and industrial) complexes in finding the addresses," Fire Department Capt. Tom Huntley said. 
City inspectors have the authority to fine building owners for not complying with the law, but that probably will not be necessary, Huntley said.
