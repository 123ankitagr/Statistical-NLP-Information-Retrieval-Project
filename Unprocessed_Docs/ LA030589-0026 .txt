Mathews writes of the "bias of the actors branch toward comedy performances." What about the following?: 
Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert, "It Happened One Night"; James Stewart, "The Philadelphia Story"; Loretta Young, "The Farmer's Daughter"; William Holden, "Stalag 17"; Diane Keaton, "Annie Hall"; Glenda Jackson, "A Touch of Class"; Maggie Smith, "California Suite"; Melvyn Douglas, "Being There"; Ingrid Bergman, "Murder on the Orient Express"; Richard Dreyfuss, "The Goodbye Girl"; George Sanders, "All About Eve"; Charles Coburn, "The More the Merrier"; Barry Fitzgerald, "Going My Way"; Edmund Gwinn, "The Miracle on 34th Street"; Audrey Hepburn, "Roman Holiday": Marie Dressler, "Min and Bill." 
And digging way, way, way back into memory, how about Michael Caine in "Hannah and Her Sisters" (1986) and Cher in "Moonstruck" (1987)?
