Sir, Professor Rigas Doganis ('No freedom in the skies', April 30) states
that, with fare deregulation pending, Europe has already lost most of its
independent scheduled airlines; that the smaller national carriers will go
the same way; and that, in practice, fare cuts will probably be small. Would
it not be better if fares were to remain regulated, so that we could have
competition not on price but on quality of service? Does not the same
argument apply to banking?
