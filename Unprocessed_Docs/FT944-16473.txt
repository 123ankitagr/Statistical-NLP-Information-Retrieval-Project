Royal Insurance has appointed a marketing specialist as managing director of
The Insurance Service, its direct writing insurance arm.
Sydney Pennington is a former sales and marketing executive of retail group
Marks & Spencer and, more recently, former joint managing director of
Richard Branson's Virgin Atlantic.
Royal was one of the first composite insurers to follow the market leader
Direct Line Insurance by setting up a direct insurance arm; but competition
has increased as others have started to sell insurance policies via the
telephone and advertising.
Royal Insurance is hoping Pennington, 49, will raise the profile of The
Insurance Service, which started in 1988 and currently insures more than
400,000 private motorists and households.
The time is now right, says Pennington, 'to go into the next stage which
will be a more rapid period of growth'. He expects the company to develop
and expand sales of new products, particularly in house insurance, and also
to try to increase the amount of business it conducts with each customer.
With direct insurers breaking down the traditional method of buying policies
via brokers, Pennington's previous experience in building customer links
will prove helpful; at Marks & Spencer he was involved in the development of
the group's 'neighbourhood' food stores; at Virgin he helped develop the
group's Megastores.
One disadvantage Pennington faces is The Insurance Service's relatively
little known brand name. Last year Royal Insurance began a pilot project
using the title Royal Insurance Direct. For now, Royal Insurance appears
content to run the two as separate operations; it believes that each may be
able to target different client groups.
