A new cooling valve was fitted inside the space shuttle Columbia at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 
A bad valve had been removed and found to have a torn filter. An inspection of adjacent plumbing uncovered no other problems. The valve had delayed Columbia's mission until at least the end of the month. It had been scheduled to lift off today with seven astronauts and the Astro observatory, capable of detecting sources of radiation.
