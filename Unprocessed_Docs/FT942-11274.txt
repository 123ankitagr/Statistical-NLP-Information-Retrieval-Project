Nicholas Payne, director of the Royal Opera, has put together an intriguing
1994-95 season at Covent Garden. Richard Eyre, of the National Theatre,
directs his first opera, La traviata; Jonathan Miller returns to work in the
UK with his first Covent Garden production, Cosi fan tutte; while Gilbert &
Sullivan also make their House debut in the new WNO production of The Yeomen
of the Guard.
There is also the first new British Ring of the 1990s, starting on October
13 with Das Rheingold, with Richard Jones handling the staging; the first
Covent Garden production since 1930 of Gounod's Romeo et Juliette; and the
first ever performance at Covent Garden of Purcell's King Arthur.
Throw in a Verdi season in the summer of 1995, with seven productions, (two
in concert performance) and including the first Garden playing of I due
Foscari, and you have an exciting programme. AT
