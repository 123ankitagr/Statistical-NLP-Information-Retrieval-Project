A cargo ship hit an oil platform in the southern Gulf of Suez, causing millions of dollars in damage to the rig but no casualties, a senior oil company official said Saturday. 
The platform is owned by Gulf Petroleum Co., or Gupco, a joint Egyptian-American venture with major operations in the gulf between mainland Egypt and Sinai. 
The Gupco official said the collision spilled a small amount of oil from the platform into the gulf. He said damage to the platform is expected to exceed $10 million.
