Michael Weisman, former executive producer of sports programming at NBC, has been named co-executive producer of "The Pat Sajak Show." 
Weisman worked in NBC's sports division for 15 years, leaving earlier this year. CBS cited his expertise in live television as a key reason in bringing him aboard its low-rated late-night talk show Monday. He will share the executive producer title with Sajak.
