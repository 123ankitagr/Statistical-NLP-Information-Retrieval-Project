SOUTH KOREA said yesterday that it had no plans to repatriate any of the
5,000 Korean construction workers who risk being stranded in Libya by a
United Nations embargo on air travel.
Government officials said that Korean companies would continue working in
Libya, where the Korean contractors are estimated to be owed almost Dollars
6bn (Pounds 3.4bn) for work already completed. At least four large South
Korean groups - Dong-Ah, Daewoo, Hyundai and Samsung - are currently working
on projects in the country.
Korean companies working in Libya also employ close to 10,000 third-country
nationals, many from Thailand and the Philippines.
The Korean government has been working on contingency plans to prevent
Korean and third country citizens from being stranded. These would involve
moving workers overland to Tunisia where they would be put on chartered
flights.
Mr Ho Seung, assistant foreign minister, said: 'South Korea has requested
help from Tunisia through diplomatic channels on flight re-routing and it
has promised full support.' Korean Air currently flies from Seoul to Tripoli
via Bahrain and Jeddah. The last flight is due to leave Seoul on April 13
just before the UN air embargo takes effect on April 15.
South Korean companies have been very successful at winning contracts in the
Middle East where they have been able to offer low prices on the back of
cheap labour from Asia.
Initially workers were brought from Korea. More recently labour has been
come from other countries. Libya yesterday gave hundreds of foreigners exit
visas. A western ambassador in Tripoli said 250 South Koreans and a
'considerable number' of European Community nationals were given visas.
