DR GERALD Smith, chief executive of Farr Group, a building group, stole
Pounds 2m from its pension fund to pay company debts, Southwark Crown Court
heard yesterday.
Dr Smith forged an authority to liquidate assets of the Farr Group pension
fund in January 1990, the court heard. The group collapsed in 1990 with
debts of more than Pounds 30m.
Dr Smith denies seven charges of theft and one of forgery. The trial
continues on Monday.
