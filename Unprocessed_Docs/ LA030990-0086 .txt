Santa Barbara Film Fest Change: Don't wait in line Saturday for the world premiere of John Waters' "Cry Baby," the scheduled finale of the Santa Barbara International Film Festival. 
The festival's publicity director, Sheila Barr, said that the film has been yanked under orders by its distributor, Universal. She said that festival officials were not given an explanation. The film will be replaced by a re-screening of "Black Rainbow," starring Rosanna Arquette and Jason Robards. Last Saturday, "Black Rainbow" was a sellout and the festival had to turn 400 people away.
