Singer Eddy Arnold was reported in critical but stable condition today following double-bypass heart surgery. 
Arnold, 71, underwent the surgery Wednesday at St. Thomas Hospital. Dr. William Cotharp, a cardiovascular surgeon who performed the operation, said the performer may be ready for release from the hospital next week. 
"Barring unforeseen complications, Mr. Arnold should be able to resume normal activities," Cotharp said in a statement released by the hospital. 
He recently released his first album in six years, "Hand-Holding Songs."
