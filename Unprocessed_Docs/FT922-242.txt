If South Africa's Anglo American and the country's National Union of
Mineworkers fall out over their ground-breaking labour relations agreement,
help is at hand.
Observer hears that ANC secretary general Cyril Ramaphosa is soon to move in
next door to the expansive Brenthurst estate of Harry Oppenheimer, Anglo's
83-year-old retired chairman.
Ramaphosa, widely seen as Nelson Mandela's heir apparent, is a lawyer who
first made his name as a negotiator with Anglo American when he was
secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers. Who knows what disputes may
now be settled by a neighbourly chat between two of South Africa's most
formidable power brokers.
