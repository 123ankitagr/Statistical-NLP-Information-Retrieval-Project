A group of supporters of Mayor Marion Barry gathered at a park in the nation's capital to rally and pray for the city's embattled leader, indicted on drug charges. Various ministers and elected officials spoke in support of Barry to nearly 300 supporters. The supporters were unanimous in their criticism of the federal government's use of Rasheeda Moore, a former model and friend of Barry, in the case against the mayor.
