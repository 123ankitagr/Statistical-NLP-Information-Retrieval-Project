The Export Credits Guarantee Department, Britain's official export credit
insurer, has, after 12 years, restored medium- and long-term credit for
Vietnam, Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the Board of Trade, announced
yesterday, Anthony McDermott writes in London. It follows Vietnam's
agreements with the International Monetary Fund and the Paris Club towards
the end of last year.
Vietnam is the third country for which ECGD has resumed cover this year. In
January ECGD came back on cover for Egypt and Lebanon.
