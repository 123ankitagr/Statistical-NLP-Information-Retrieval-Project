West Covina city manager Herman R. Fast announced he is retiring Sept. 30, stepping down from a job he has held for the past 14 years. 
Fast, 63, made the announcement at a meeting this week of the City Council. 
He began working for the city in 1962 as a planning commissioner, and became assistant city manager before leaving West Covina in 1972 to become city manager of Chino. In 1976, Fast returned to West Covina as city manager. 
The council is expected to name an interim city manager Sept. 10, said Steve Wylie, assistant to the city manager. According to the city code, the council has until Dec. 1 to replace Fast.
