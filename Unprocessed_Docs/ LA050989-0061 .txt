A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy opened fire on two vicious dogs, killing one of them, after the animals charged him in the back yard of a Lancaster house Monday, authorities said. 
The incident occurred about 7:30 a.m. as detectives conducted a search inside the house and arrested four people, said Sheriff's Sgt. Ron Shreves. 
Shreves said the deputy, whose name was not released, fired a shotgun at a pit bull and a boxer when the animals ran at him behind a house in the 800 block of West Avenue H-14. The boxer was killed and the pit bull was slightly wounded. 
Four people inside the house were arrested on suspicion of possessing stolen property, Shreves said. Theresa Ore, 27, Denise Thomas, 27, Ronald Keeylen, 30, and Alphonso Nedd, 28, were being held at the sheriff's Antelope Valley station jail in lieu of $5,000 bail each. 
Shreves said detectives had obtained a warrant to search the house for narcotics and stolen weapons. No drugs were found but deputies seized several guns.
