A 6-year-old boy was killed Friday morning when a truck broadsided his mother's car at the intersection of Chase Avenue and Anza Street in El Cajon, police said. 
El Cajon firefighters had to extricate Daniel James Long from the passenger seat of his mother's 1984 Mercury Cougar, police said. 
The El Cajon boy was taken by paramedics to Sharp Memorial Hospital about 8 a.m., where he died a short time later, police said. 
Daniel's mother, Catherine King Long, 27, suffered minor injuries in the accident and did not require treatment, police said. The driver of the truck, James Bradbury, 22, of El Cajon, was uninjured, police said. 
The accident occurred about 7:52 a.m. when Catherine Long, traveling east on Chase Avenue, attempted to make a left turn north onto Anza, police said. She was broadsided by a 1988 Isuzu flatbed truck driven by Bradbury, police said. Neither driver was cited.
