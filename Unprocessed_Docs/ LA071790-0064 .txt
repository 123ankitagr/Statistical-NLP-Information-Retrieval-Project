Kevin Mackey, basketball coach at Cleveland State, had cocaine in his system when he was arrested outside a suspected drug house, and his blood alcohol level was 0.2, well above the legal limit, police said. 
A urinalysis given to Mackey was designed to determine only whether the coach had drugs in his system and did not measure how much cocaine was present. Further charges could be filed against Mackey, who pleaded not guilty in Cleveland Municipal Court to drunken-driving charges stemming from the Friday night incident.
