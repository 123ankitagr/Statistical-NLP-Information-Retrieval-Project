Trump Payment in Doubt: Developer Donald J. Trump raised new doubts about his financial stability by telling the American Stock Exchange that it was unclear whether he would make an interest payment on Taj Mahal casino bonds next month. 
Bob Shabazian, an exchange spokesman, said the Trump Organization made the statement in response to a question from the exchange, where the bonds are traded. Shabazian said Trump didn't say whether the payment would be made. The Trump Organization is supposed to pay $47 million in interest on $675 million in Taj bonds Nov. 15.
