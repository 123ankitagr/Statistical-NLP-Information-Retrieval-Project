American Cytogenetics in North Hollywood said it reached a tentative agreement to merge its Diagenetics Laboratories Inc. unit with Odyssey Biomedical, a newly formed New York company. 
Both Diagenetics, based in West Paterson, N.J., and Odyssey Biomedical provide genetic testing services, the most common of which is amniocentesis, which helps identify genetic defects and other problems in fetuses. 
American Cytogenetics, which also provides testing services for cancer and other diseases, is still negotiating terms of the proposed merger, said American Cytogenetics President Allen Manzano.
