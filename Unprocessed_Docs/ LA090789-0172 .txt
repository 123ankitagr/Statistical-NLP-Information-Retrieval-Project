Free use of Costa Mesa's golf course was granted to retired city workers and former and current City Council members by the council Tuesday. 
Retired employees must have served the city for at least 20 years to be eligible for golf passes, which waive green fees at the Costa Mesa Golf and Country Club. 
Councilman Orville Amburgey said the passes were a way to recognize workers with long service to the city. 
For several years the city has informally allowed former and current City Council members to play without charge. Their inclusion in this new policy formalizes that practice.
