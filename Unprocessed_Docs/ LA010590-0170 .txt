Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been renominated for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize, a source at the Nobel Institute said today. 
"Gorbachev has been proposed," said the source at the Norwegian Nobel Institute, which traditionally declines to confirm or deny the names of the candidates. 
The Soviet leader was nominated in 1988 and 1989, but the prize went to the U.N. peacekeeping forces and Tibet's spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, respectively. 
Both times Gorbachev shared the nomination with former President Ronald Reagan for their signing of an intermediate-range nuclear forces agreement. The source said the institute had received no nomination for Reagan.
