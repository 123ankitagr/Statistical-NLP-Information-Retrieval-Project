Actress Zsa Zsa Gabor pleaded innocent today to slapping a motorcycle officer who stopped her Rolls Royce on La Cienega Boulevard June 14 for having expired tags. 
The often-married Hungarian-born actress appeared in Beverly Hills Municipal Court and denied one count each of battery on a police officer, disobeying a police officer and having an expired driver's license. Gabor, who lists her age as 66, also pleaded innocent to two infractions: having an open container of alcohol in a vehicle and having an expired vehicle registration. 
Municipal Judge Charles Rubin allowed Gabor to remain free without posting bail and scheduled a pre-trial hearing for Aug. 2.
