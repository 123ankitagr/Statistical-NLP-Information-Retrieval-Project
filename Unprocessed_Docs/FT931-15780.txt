Anyone doubting that talent for big-business leadership can show very early
may care to consider the following teatime conversation between a
four-year-old and his mother, quoted in Margaret Donaldson's book, Human
Minds, published by Penguin.
He: Is God everywhere?
She: Yes dear.
He: In this room?
She: Yes.
He: Is he in my mug?
She (growing uneasy): Yes.
He (clapping his hand over the mug): Got him]
