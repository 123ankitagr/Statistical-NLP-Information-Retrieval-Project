HAMMERSON, the UK property group, has had its credit ratings cut by Moody's
Investors Service, the US credit rating agency, and may yet face another
downgrading, writes Simon London.
Moody's has cut the long-term credit rating from A2 to A3, a rating which
applies to a recent Pounds 100m Eurosterling bond issue. The short-term
credit rating for commercial paper is lowered from Prime-1 to Prime-2.
