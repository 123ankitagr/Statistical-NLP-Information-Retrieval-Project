THE Swedish Export Council has warned companies that they should export to
the former Soviet Union only on an advance-payment basis, after a survey
showed unpaid debt to Swedish firms had nearly doubled in six months, Reuter
reports from Stockholm.
In its survey covering 32 Swedish companies, the export council said
payments due from companies in the former Soviet Union, mainly Russia, grew
to Skr456m (Pounds 44m) in June from Skr256m in January.
'Our general recommendation is that Swedish companies should demand advance
payments or bank guarantees before delivering any goods,' Mr Staffan
Stenstrom at the export council said.
Swedish exports to the former Soviet Union totalled Skr2.3bn in 1991.
