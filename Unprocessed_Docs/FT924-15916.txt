TWENTY-NINE buildings win regional awards for architecture from the Royal
Institute of British Architects today.
The Riba awards are intended to recognise buildings considered 'outstanding
examples of current architecture'. The winners range from a simple house
extension in Edinburgh to two sports buildings in Sheffield designed for the
World Student Games. The most successful building type was office
developments - 10 win awards, ranging from converted farm buildings in
Shropshire to the Reuters building in London's Docklands.
The multi-storey car park (pictured) in Chichester is among those honoured.
The architects, Birds Portchmouth Russum, fitted the building into the city
by extending the city wall. The jury said: 'The building makes valuable and
acceptable a building type that is usually considered unglamorous. The
analysis of the various areas that touch the site and how they can be
redefined by the building shows great clarity of thought.'
