Sir, Re your story, 'Universities allowed to charge top-up fees for tuition'
(June 9), does this government decision herald a slow return to the days
when only the eldest child in wealthier families could be educated at
university?
Surely, if savings in public expenditure must be made it would be far
preferable to eliminate tax relief on mortgages once and for all. This
subsidy could be removed with relatively little pain during the current
period of low interest rates and might even be announced as a prelude to
some further lowering. Sadly, it would be all too typical of British
political priorities if bricks and mortar were to take precedence over
genuinely open access to higher education.
