A JAPANESE company affiliated with Japan Air Lines, and Grumman of the US,
are considering joint development of linear motor cars in the US, writes
Michiyo Nakamoto in Tokyo.
HSST, which is a company established to develop magnetic levitation linear
motor cars, and Grumman, the US defence manufacturer, are working towards
agreement on joining forces to develop the next generation public
transportation vehicles.
The two sides are still discussing what form co-operation between the
Japanese and US companies might take but a joint venture is one possibility.
One plan that is being discussed is to build a line between New York's JFK
and La Guardia airports.
HSST and Grumman have already been in discussion with the New York and New
Jersey Port Authorities on a plan to build a linear motor car line that
would eventually run into New York city itself.
Linear motor cars are an advanced public transportation system which can run
at speeds of 100 to 200 kilometres per hour. Japan has been working on
developing linear motor car technology for several years.
