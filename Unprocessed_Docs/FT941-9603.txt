It's not often that Virginia Bottomley, Britain's health minister, is
juxtaposed with Aristotle; but we live in unusual times.
The Advertising Association has published a punchy pamphlet - Ads and Fags -
on the confused debate over the relationship between advertising and tobacco
consumption. Rallied in support of continued cigarette advertising are
Bottomley: 'We should not ban the advertising of something it is legal to
buy' - and adjacent, Aristotle: 'The word 'Dog' never bit anyone'.
The possibilities are legion. Inventive copywriters could, for instance,
immediately turn to Jean-Paul Sartre's weighty treatise Being and
Nothingness - yoking it alongside the activities of any one of a number of
politicians.
