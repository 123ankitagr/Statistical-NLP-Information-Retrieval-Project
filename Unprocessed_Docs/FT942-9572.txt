It is rash to assume that a fee-based adviser is automatically a good
adviser, writes Joanna Slaughter. Indeed, people should be very careful
before placing their affairs in the hands of any IFA. The following
questions could help:
1. What is the background of those running this firm? What are their
qualifications to advise me about money?
2. Can you supply the names of anyone to whom I can apply for a reference
about you?
3. How much do you charge? Are fees agreed in advance? Are fees time-based?
Will you charge me for the initial interview? How will I be billed? What
happens about any commission payments?
4. Can I see an example of a financial planning report that has been
prepared for an existing client?
5. How can I judge the investment performance you have achieved for clients?
If there are no relevant performance statistics, can I see a current client
port-folio?
6. How will you keep in touch with me? What information will I get from you
during the year? What happens if my financial circumstances change?
7. Will all your advice be confirmed in writing?
8. Do you provide a complete management of assets? What other services do
you offer? Will you liaise with my accountant and solicitor?
9. Do you handle cash? If so, what safeguards do I have that it is secure?
Do you have indemnity insurance?
10. How quickly can we terminate our relationship if it does not work out?
