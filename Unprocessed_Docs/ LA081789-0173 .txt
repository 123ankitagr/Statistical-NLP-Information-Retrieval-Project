Parents concerned about drug and alcohol abuse can get two pamphlets on these problems from the local office of state Sen. John Seymour (R-Anaheim). 
The booklets offer guidelines on what to look for and what to do if a child has a substance abuse problem, said Seymour, who is chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Substance Abuse. 
The guides are entitled "The Facts About Alcohol Abuse -- How Parents Can Protect their Children," and "The Facts About Drug Abuse -- How Parents Can Protect Their Children." To get either brochure write to Seymour, 2150 Towne Centre Place, Suite 205, Anaheim, Calif. 92806.
