Executed Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's daughter, Zoe, was released from jail but still faces accusations she helped to embezzle vast amounts of state funds. 
The 41-year-old mathematician with a reputation for promiscuity and heavy drinking was met by crowds of friends and relatives, including her brother, Valentin, who was freed Friday. She was released together with her husband, Mircea Oprea, a computer scientist. She and her brother were arrested immediately after December's revolution in which both their parents were executed.
