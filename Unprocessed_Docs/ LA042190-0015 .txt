Regarding Jack Mathews' April 12 commentary, "Is It Time to Change the Ratings System for Movies?": Perhaps it is time for an A rating (for adults only); but after reading his synopsis of the movies he thought needed an A rating, I couldn't help but wonder why anyone would want to make those film -- or watch them. 
What could be entertaining or enlightening about graphic sex, scatological violence, child abuse, torture, cannibalism? Do we really need "Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down," a movie about bondage? Why not a how-to course too?
