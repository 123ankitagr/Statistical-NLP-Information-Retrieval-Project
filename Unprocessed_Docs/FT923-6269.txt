Indonesia's leading environmental group urged the government yesterday to
ban a Japanese ship transporting plutonium from passing through its waters
in the straits of Malacca, Reuter reports from Jakarta. 'We ask the
government to refuse the ship carrying plutonium the right to enter
Indonesian waters,' the Indonesian Environmental Forum said.
The Japanese-registered Akatsuki Maru left Yokohama for the French port of
Cherbourg on Monday to collect a tonne of radioactive plutonium reprocessed
from spent Japanese nuclear fuel.
