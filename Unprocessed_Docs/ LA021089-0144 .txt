Members of the California Police Chiefs Assn. meeting in Costa Mesa voted almost unanimously Thursday to back proposed state legislation banning private ownership of military-style assault weapons, said the group's president, Craig L. Meacham. 
Meacham, police chief of West Covina, said only two of the approximately 200 chiefs attending the conference cast dissenting votes. "They wanted even stronger legislation," Meacham said.
