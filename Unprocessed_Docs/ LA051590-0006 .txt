How wonderful to read that Mayor Bradley is leading the way in water conservation "by having his car washed at the City Hall garage" rather than at his Hancock Park residence (May 4). Are we to believe that the City Hall gets its water supply from some other source, or that the rest of us may save water by having our cars washed at the City Hall? 
The mayor is setting the kind of example (and peculiar logic) that makes us realize how we got into this mess in this first place.
