Point Arguello Intermediary Appointed: Energy Secretary James D. Watkins appointed an intermediary to work with oil companies and Santa Barbara County officials to speed up the process of permitting oil production at the Point Arguello offshore field, which sits idle despite completion two years ago. The unusual move was prompted by the Middle East crisis, which has focused new attention on domestic sources of oil. In a letter to county officials, Watkins named Stephen Wakefield, general counsel with the Energy Department, to mediate.
