Penn State quarterback Tom Bill has withdrawn from classes and voluntarily admitted himself to an alcohol treatment program, Coach Joe Paterno said today. 
Bill is a senior with one year of eligibility remaining and is a native of Flemington, N.J. He began the 1989 season as the starting quarterback for the Nittany Lions, but was suspended Sept. 19 for violation of team rules. The suspension came one day after he was cited by campus police for an alcohol-related incident. 
"I have decided to admit myself, on my own initiative, to an alcohol education and rehabilitation facility," Bill said in a statement he wrote and distributed through the Penn State sports information office.
