Two Commodity Dealers Banned: Two former commodity futures salesmen at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were each fined $150,000 and permanently barred from the exchange for fraud, the CME said. Norman Furlett and Ira Greenspon were accused of a scheme to divert customers' profits into their own accounts. They had worked at GNP Commodities Inc. The CME said the two have repaid customers an unspecified amount.
