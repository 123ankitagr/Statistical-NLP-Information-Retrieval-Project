BT and Mercury are slashing their long-distance week-end prices from next
Saturday. A 3-minute BT call to anywhere in the country will cost 10p; a
Mercury 3-minute call will cost 8.8p. Mercury is offering further reductions
for week-ends in December and January.
Across about half of the country (including London), BT users without a
Mercury 'blue button' phone can become Mercury subscribers within a few days
by means of a '132' connection. Once registered, subscribers access
Mercury's long-distance and international network by prefixing their calls
with the digits '132'. Mercury charges an annual fee of Pounds 10.
