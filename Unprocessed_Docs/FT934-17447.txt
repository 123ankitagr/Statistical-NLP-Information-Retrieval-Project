THE NEW ZEALAND government said yesterday it would abolish a key link with
the British legal system and perhaps follow Australia's move towards
becoming a republic, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Mr Jim Bolger, prime minister, said New Zealand would cut its legal link
with Britain's Privy Council, the highest court of appeal for New
Zealanders. 'That's something that's being talked about in New Zealand and
I'm sure we'll do that reasonably soon,' Mr Bolger said on television. 'It's
part of nationhood in the sense of being totally in control of our own
judicial system.'
But he played down comments by Foreign Minister Don McKinnon that it might
also dump the monarchy, saying: 'It's not an issue the public are excited
about in New Zealand.'
Mr Paul Keating, Australian prime minister, has unveiled plans to abandon
the monarchy and turn his country into a republic by the year 2000. Mr
McKinnon told Radio New Zealand that Wellington might follow Australia -
'Not with the same enthusiasm, but maybe (ending) up at the same destination
a few years later.'
