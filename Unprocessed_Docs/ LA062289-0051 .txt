Vietnam turned over the remains of 28 people believed to have been American servicemen missing since the Vietnam War, and it plans to give U.S. officials another 16 sets of remains. Maj. Dan Trout, a U.S. spokesman, said a 21-member U.S. military team received the remains at a ceremony at Hanoi's international airport. Trout said the 28 remains were delivered in wooden boxes, inspected by a U.S. forensic expert and then transferred to aluminum caskets. The caskets were loaded onto a C-141 transport aircraft and flown to Hawaii for identification at a U.S. military laboratory.
