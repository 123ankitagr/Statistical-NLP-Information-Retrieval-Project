Under intense pressure to explain how 24 Taiwanese died in a boat fire,
China announced yesterday the arrest of three men suspected of robbing and
murdering the tourists, AP reports from Beijing.
China's failure to explain the mysterious boat fire that killed 32 people -
eight mainland Chinese and the Taiwanese tourists - on a lake in eastern
China on March 31 has been threatening the growing detente between the two
sides.
Taiwan announced plans last week to ban travel to China and to suspend
cultural exchanges unless Beijing gave a satisfactory explanation.
After first describing the fire as an accident China said on its national
television news that the Taiwanese had been robbed and murdered on Thousand
Island Lake by three young men.
