Nigel Andrews selects his top five films for Christmas:
A hundred movies crowd into the TV networks over the festive season and the
message from the media pulpit must be: Keep Those Video-Recorders On Power.
Most of the best films each day are on after midnight - and most of the
second best are on in the afternoon, when you and the family may be walking
off the latest Trimalchean feast.
Here are the five treats most worth staying up for or worth getting a genius
to set the VCR timer:
The Philadelphia Story
(BBC1, Christmas Eve)
Manhattan and Crimes And Misdemeanors
(C4 and BBC2, Sunday)
A Fish Called Wanda
(BBC1, Monday)
Marx Brothers season
(C4, throughout the weekend)
