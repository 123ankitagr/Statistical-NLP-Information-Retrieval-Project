A financial drive to convert the Hawkins House into a town hall has reached $100,000. 
An official from Nottingham Ltd., the firm that plans to develop the house's site, at the corner of Lake and Sacramento avenues, gave $20,000 last week to the Altadena Town Hall committee. 
An estimated $300,000 is needed to relocate and renovate the 99-year-old Victorian home. Community leaders have two months to raise the additional $200,000 before the house's site is cleared. 
The committee plans to move the 6,000-square-foot house, built in 1891 by Los Angeles grocer G. D. Rowan, to a site on El Molino Avenue between the county sheriff's and fire stations. It would house community meeting rooms, a museum, a theater and a meeting place for the Town Council.
