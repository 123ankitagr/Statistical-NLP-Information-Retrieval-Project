Two leading British film directors, Mr Ridley Scott and Mr Tony Scott, are
to buy Shepperton Studios, west of London, in a deal thought to be worth
about Pounds 10m, Michael Skapinker writes.
The two brothers say they want to develop the studios into one of the
world's leading film production facilities.
Mr Ridley Scott was the director of such films as Alien, Blade Runner and
Thelma and Louise. Mr Tony Scott directed Top Gun and Beverly Hills Cop II.
Mr Ridley Scott said yesterday that they would use their knowledge of the US
film industry to ensure an increase in the number of films produced at the
studios.
Shepperton Studios, founded in 1936, is owned by Lee International, a
private UK company. Recent productions include Four Weddings And A Funeral
and Frankenstein. A science fiction film starring Sylvester Stallone, Judge
Dredd, is being made there.
Mr Ridley Scott said the studios were in a healthy financial state, with
pre-tax profits last year of Pounds 1.3m and higher profits expected for
1994.
He said that one of their priorities would be to increase the studios' share
of post-production film business. Several directors who had made films at
the studios had in the past gone elsewhere for such services. He said
revenues from the post-production phase of film making were high.
