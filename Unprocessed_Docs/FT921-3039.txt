TEXAS Instruments (TI), the US semiconductor company, has signed
cross-licensing agreements with two Japanese companies that recognise TI's
claim to have invented the integrated circuit, a fundamental device in all
modern electronic equipment.
The agreements, with Sharp and Ricoh, represent an important step for TI
towards protecting hundreds of millions of dollars in patent rights in
Japan. They are particularly significant because they are the first such
agreements since a decision last summer by Fujitsu, the Japanese computer
company, to dispute TI's claim in the Japanese courts.
It had been feared that other companies would hesitate to recognise the
Texas Instruments patent until its dispute with Fujitsu had been resolved.
Texas Instruments said yesterday, however, that it was continuing to
negotiate licensing agreements with at least ten other electronics
companies, including Mitsubishi Electric, and that the negotiations appear
to have been unaffected by the Fujitsu dispute.
Seven Japanese companies have now accepted the Texas Instruments patent
claim, including Toshiba, Oki Electric, Matsushita, and NEC.
Texas Instruments first applied for a Japanese patent for the integrated
circuit in 1960, but struggled until 1989 before the 'Kilby' patent - named
after a co-inventor of the integrated circuit, Mr Jack Kilby - was accepted
by the Japan Patent Office.
Texas Instruments claims the patent covers fundamental technology that
applies to all integrated circuits, while Fujitsu claims its own
semiconductor devices do not use Texas Instruments technology.
Fujitsu last July sought a court determination that the Texas Instruments
patent does not apply to Fujitsu products. Seven court hearings have been
held to date, and final resolution is expected to take at least another
year. Texas Instruments hopes that recognition of its patent by other
Japanese companies will support its case.
