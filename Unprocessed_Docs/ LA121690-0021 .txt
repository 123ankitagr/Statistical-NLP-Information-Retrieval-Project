THIS HOLIDAY SEASON you can play artist as well as Santa when you create a personalized T-shirt from Color 'M Creations. 
The two holiday designs -- a Christmas scene and a Hanukkah message -- are outlined on 100% cotton T-shirts. With the seven enclosed dye sticks, kids can add polka dots, stripes or any geometric pattern -- in colors guaranteed not to run -- to a portion or all of the shirt. 
The T-shirts, which come in adult and children's sizes, range in price from $14.50 to $17.50.  Color 'M Creations T-shirts are available at the Paper Rainbow, 3507 Motor Ave., Los Angeles, (213) 558-1885, or by mail order: Color 'M Creations, 2011 Pearl St., Santa Monica 90405, (213) 456-8995.
