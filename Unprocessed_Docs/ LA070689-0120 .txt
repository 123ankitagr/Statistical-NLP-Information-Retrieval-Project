The California Highway Patrol reported 78 traffic deaths over the long Fourth of July weekend. Officers also made 2,857 arrests for driving while intoxicated. Of the traffic deaths reported in CHP jurisdictions, 49 victims were not wearing seat belts. The holiday period for this year's Independence Day weekend lasted 4 1/2 days, and is not comparable to the 3 1/2 days for 1988, the CHP noted. The last comparable period was in 1985, when 71 motorists were killed.
