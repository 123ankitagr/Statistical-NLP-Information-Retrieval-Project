Los Angeles County agricultural officials reported Friday the trapping of a pregnant Mexican fruit fly in Monrovia, sparking an intensified round of fly trapping and ground pesticide spraying within 200 meters of the find. 
The Mexfly was found Wednesday in a sapote tree on Grand Avenue. It is the first found in the county since July 23, when a single immature male fly was trapped in Watts. 
Robert Atkins, deputy agricultural commissioner, said no aerial spraying is planned. But the discovery of any additional flies could force agricultural officials to order the controversial aerial malathion applications, he said. 
After the Mediterranean fruit fly, Mexflies are considered the next most dangerous fruit fly to agriculture.
