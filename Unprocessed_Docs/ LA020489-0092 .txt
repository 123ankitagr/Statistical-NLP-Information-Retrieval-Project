Two of the 10 San Jose State basketball players who walked off the team in a dispute with Coach Bill Berry over disciplinary tactics have begun discussions to end the 2-week-old walkout. 
During a meeting earlier this week with Berry and Athletic Director Randy Hoffmann, players Angelo Foccia and David Hollaway asked to return to the team, Hollaway said. 
Hoffman confirmed meeting with two players but would not identify them. He said discussions may last a couple of days. 
The players announced the boycott Jan. 18, saying they would not play or practice as long as Berry was their coach.
