Exxon Valdez skipper Joseph Hazelwood dropped his extradition fight today and flew to Alaska to surrender for arraignment on three misdemeanor charges arising out of the biggest oil spill in North American history. 
Hazelwood, 42, was to appear in the afternoon on charges of operating the Exxon tanker while intoxicated, reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil on March 24.
