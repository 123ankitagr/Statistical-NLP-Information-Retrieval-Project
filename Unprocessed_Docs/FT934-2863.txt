A Norfolk-based company plans to market a soluble and biodegradable film
which will allow nappies and female-hygiene products to be safely flushed
down the toilet.
Film Technology is seeking a worldwide patent on the composite film, known
as B9, which will be launched in the new year. It would be used to replace
the outer plastic film found in current brands.
More than 3bn disposable nappies are used in Britain each year, creating an
estimated 70,000 tons of waste. About 40bn are used annually worldwide.
The company, based near Thetford, says the nappy film is impervious to water
on its inner side. But that breaks down when it is flushed away and the
nappy changes into a biodegradable 'slurry'.
