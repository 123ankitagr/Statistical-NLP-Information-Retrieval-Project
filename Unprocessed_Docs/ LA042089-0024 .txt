Nearly every day I read of a gang- or drug-related shooting incident on our city streets. I'm amazed at how young some of the boys are that are involved in these problems. I'm probably not wrong to assume that many of these kids come from single-parent (read mother only) households. 
I like to feel that I'm contributing in a small way to preventing some of these problems. I'm a Big Brother to two fatherless, brotherless young Chicano boys. We have a great time together and I feel I'm a positive influence in their lives. Their mom certainly thinks so. 
All of the Big Brother organizations, including mine, Catholic Big Brothers, desperately need more volunteer men. We have great group activities and outings, and it's also a good networking opportunity on the adult-to-adult level. 
Next time one of you guys see our "It takes a big man to be a big brother" billboards around town, please call.
