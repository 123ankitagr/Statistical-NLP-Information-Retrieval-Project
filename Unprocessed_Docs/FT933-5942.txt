A FLURRY of litigation has broken out between Exxon, the largest US oil
company, and a group of insurers, led by Lloyd's of London, over part of the
Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 2.4bn) of clean-up and settlement costs arising from
the Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska in 1989.
The insurers, which include American International Group and Cigna, among
others, have lodged an action in federal court in New York, seeking a
declaration from it that they are not liable for the costs of the oil spill.
Exxon said it believed the action was in response to a suit it had launched
in Texas state court at the beginning of August to recover a portion of its
costs arising from the Valdez spill.
'The insurance clearly covers the amount claimed,' Exxon said, adding that
it had resorted to litigation only after four years of discussions with the
insurers had failed to resolve the matter.
Neither side would disclose the amount under dispute, although Exxon said it
was 'substantial' and related to both 'expenses and liabilities' incurred by
the company as a result of the environmental disaster.
