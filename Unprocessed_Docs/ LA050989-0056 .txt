Greg Santos, a senior in his first season on the Simi Valley High baseball team, was declared academically ineligible when quarter grades were released last week, Coach Mike Scyphers said. 
Santos was batting .323, with four home runs, seven doubles and 18 runs batted in. He spent much of the season batting cleanup for the Pioneers, who are 20-3 and have clinched at least a share of the Marmonte League title. 
Santos spent his junior year at Apollo High, a continuation school in Simi Valley, because of academic and personal problems. 
Three Reseda High baseball players suspended in the wake of a brawl in a game against Grant have been reinstated, Coach Mike Stone said Monday. 
Senior outfielder Robert Gauteraux, senior first baseman Ron Stricklin and junior outfielder Joey Tushnet have been cleared to play in Reseda's final three games. They were suspended indefinitely for their involvement in a bench-clearing brawl that ended an April 25 game against Grant after five innings. Grant won, 13-1.
