The Basotholand Congress Party (BCP) has put two decades of exile behind it
to win Lesotho's first general election in 23 years but the former ruling
party which once banned it cried foul, Reuter reports from Maseru. The
electoral office said the BCP won a clear majority in weekend polls, taking
36 out of 65 constituencies.
The BCP's main rival, the former ruling Basotho National Party (BNP), had
not won a single seat for the 243-member parliament by mid-afternoon
yesterday. Full results were not expected until Friday.
