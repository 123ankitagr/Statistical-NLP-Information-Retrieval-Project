Costa Rican President-elect Rafael Angel Calderon promised to fight drug trafficking in his nation and said his government will have good relations with the United States because he is a friend of President Bush. Calderon, who defeated the candidate backed by President and Nobel Peace laureate Oscar Arias Sanchez on Sunday, said he plans "to turn this victory into the victory of an entire people united to fight drug trafficking."
