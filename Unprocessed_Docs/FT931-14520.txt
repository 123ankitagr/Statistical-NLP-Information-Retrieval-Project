Meeting up with an architect and a politician, a doctor claimed his
profession was older than theirs, saying: 'God performed a surgical
operation when he removed Adam's rib to create Eve.'
'You're wrong,' the architect objected. 'At least a week earlier, he'd acted
like any good architect in producing order out of chaos.'
'And who made the chaos?', the politician replied.
