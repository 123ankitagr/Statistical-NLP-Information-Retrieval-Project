London Underground's Angel station, refurbished at a cost of Pounds 74m, is
to gain an additional section above ground. Opposite the old station
entrance on the City Road an air vent and emergency exit are being built
where digging for the new station started. The project is London
Underground's most ambitious in recent years.
