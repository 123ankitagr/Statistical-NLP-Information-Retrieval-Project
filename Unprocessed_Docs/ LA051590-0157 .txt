Ved Mehta, an author and staff writer for The New Yorker since 1961, has been named a writer in residence at Yale University. 
The author will be a fellow for three years at Berkeley College, one of Yale's 12 colleges for undergraduates, the university announced Monday. 
He will teach a course on creative writing in the fall and on nonfiction next spring. 
The Indian-born author is the first Rosenkranz writer in residence, named for the new $1-million endowment created by 1962 Yale graduate Robert Rosenkranz and his wife, Margaret. 
Mehta, a naturalized American who holds degrees from Harvard and Oxford, has written books on history, theology and linguistics. His most recent book, "The Stolen Light," published in 1989, is his sixth in an autobiographical series.
