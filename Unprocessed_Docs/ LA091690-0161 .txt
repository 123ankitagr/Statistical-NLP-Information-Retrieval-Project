Continental Airlines passengers who travel through Newark International Airport will be offered free stationery and postage to write troops in the Middle East. 
"We're hoping a lot of people will take time between their coffee and boarding to jot a little note," Continental spokeswoman Andrea Pass said. 
The airline says 35,000 passengers travel through the Newark airport each day on its planes.
