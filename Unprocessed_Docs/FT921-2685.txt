TAIWAN'S parliament voted yesterday to urge a semi-official organisation to
sign an investment guarantee agreement with China to protect thousands of
Taiwanese investors, AP reports from Taipei.
The motion said Taiwan's semi-official Straits Exchange Foundation should
negotiate an accord with its counterpart in Beijing to provide Taiwan
investors with fair treatment and protect their investments from
expropriation.
Taiwan's government cannot sign a pact with the rival Communist regime in
Beijing because both sides claim to be rulers of all China and ban official
contact. Taiwan's Nationalist government fled to Taiwan in 1949 after losing
a civil war on mainland China to Communist forces.
But Taiwan's parliament can ask semi-official organisations such as the
Straits Exchange Foundation to function as go-betweens for closer economic
ties with China.
Government statistics show Taiwan companies have invested Dollars 950m
(Pounds 554m) in China. Analysts believe the figure is higher and could
total Dollars 2.5bn as many Taiwanese do not report their investments to the
government.
Last year, Taiwan's indirect trade with China through Hong Kong totalled
Dollars 5.79bn, an increase of 43.6 per cent on 1990.
On Monday, the Hong Kong-based newspaper Wen Wei Po reported that China
would establish its first free port in the south-eastern city of Xiamen to
attract business from Taiwan.
