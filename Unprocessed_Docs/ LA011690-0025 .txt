Question: I heard an explanation of how taking certain nutrients can interfere with the amount of calcium the body has, but frankly I did not follow the discussion very well. For example, could you please explain what protein has to do with calcium? If I have both protein and calcium, what difference does it make? 
Answer: Various other nutrients may affect the way the body uses calcium. An excessive intake of protein tends to increase the loss of calcium in the urine. In addition, fat and fiber may affect calcium retention. A high dietary intake of fat interferes with the absorption of calcium, while excessive amounts of fiber cause food to pass rapidly through the intestine, which limits the absorption time.
