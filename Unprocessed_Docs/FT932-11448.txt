IRI, Italy's biggest state holding company, has taken a further step to
alleviate its financial difficulties with a L600bn (Dollars 402m)
cash-for-dividends and tax-credits deal with a group of banks.
The transaction involves tax credits on 1.5bn ordinary shares in IRI's Stet
telecommunications subsidiary.
In return for making over the dividends and associated tax credits until the
end of 1995, IRI will receive around L600bn.
The transaction is similar but almost twice the size of a similar deal
agreed in March involving tax credits on shares in Banca Commerciale
Italiana, the large bank controlled by IRI. In that instance, the taker for
the tax-credits was Stet.
Separately, Stet reported yesterday that group net profits rose marginally
to L1,425bn last year from L1,413bn in 1991.
Group sales climbed sharply to L27,167bn from L22,946bn. Parent company
profits rose marginally to L775bn from L761bn in 1991.
The group is paying an unchanged dividend of L100 a share for ordinary
shares and L120 a share for savings stock.
Stet said although earnings last year had been affected by the recession,
investments remained at L10,637bn. Net group debts amounted to L22,916bn
last year.
The latest tax-credits deal involves four banks, only two of which come from
within the IRI group.
The four takers are BCI and Credito Italiano (both controlled by IRI), Banco
Ambrosiano Veneto and Carimonte Banca.
As with its previous deal involving shares in its subsidiary, IRI stressed
the transaction was of limited duration, and could be cancelled by either
side prior to the agreed termination date.
IRI is planning an ambitious disposal plan to raise cash to reduce group
debts of over L70,000bn.
However, the group has been severely criticised for using 'financial
engineering', involving deals such as that on shares in its subsidiaries,
instead of pushing ahead with asset sales.
