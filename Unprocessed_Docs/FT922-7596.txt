We have been asked to make it clear that the figures concerning doubtful
debts of Japanese financial institutions quoted in Saturday's Financial
Times are estimates by Japanese bankers and not the Bank of Japan. The
estimates are based on bankers' own assumptions and various data. The
correct range of the bankers' estimates of the total bad and doubtful debts
of banks and financial institutions is Y42,000bn-Y56,000bn as given by the
table accompanying the article.
