The federal government barred ships from dumping plastic garbage into the ocean, saying hundreds of thousands of birds, marine mammals and turtles die each year after eating or becoming entangled in the debris. In announcing the new regulations, Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said plastic debris accounted for 4% of all refuse that is tossed into the ocean each year and its resistance to natural breakdown means it can persist in the environment for long periods of time. The Coast Guard rules comply with an international agreement known as the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships. The regulations apply to U.S. flag vessels anywhere in the world and to foreign ships within 200 miles of the U.S. coast.
