An El Cajon man pleaded innocent Monday to charges that he tried to murder a prostitute after a sexual encounter. 
James Morris Jackson, 23, was arrested Thursday by the Metropolitan Homicide Task Force, the agency investigating 42 mystery killings of women, mostly prostitutes. 
The women have been killed since 1985 and their bodies dumped in remote areas of East and North County. 
Jackson is charged in an attack on a prostitute Feb. 26. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Bonnie Dumanis said the investigation is continuing, but declined to say whether Jackson would be charged with other crimes. 
Jackson is charged with attempted murder for allegedly choking a young woman unconscious in a remote area after he allegedly forced her into a sex act. He is also charged with robbery, assault with a deadly weapon and false imprisonment. 
Jackson shook his head before Municipal Judge William Woodward in denying the charges. 
According to an arrest warrant affidavit made public Monday, the prostitute said Jackson picked her up at 21st and Market streets on Feb. 26. After going to a remote area, Jackson gave her $4 and she said she wanted more money, the affidavit said. 
The woman claimed she was choked and forced to perform a sexual act before passing out, the affidavit said. She wrote down the car license number after she was dropped off in San Diego and gave police the information. 
Jackson works in the maintenance department at the Navy Public Works Center on North Island, said his attorney, Robert Carlin. Bail was set at $55,000. A preliminary hearing was set for March 16.
