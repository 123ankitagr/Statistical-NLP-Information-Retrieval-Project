About 1,000 US Marines and French troops rolled out of Mogadishu yesterday
to secure two more towns in Somalia's starving interior for Christmas Day,
Reuter reports from Mogadishu. At the same time the US Task Force command in
Somalia said fewer American troops would be required in Operation Restore
Hope than originally expected.
The Christmas push was confirmed by a US spokesman, who said the
American-led multinational force in Somalia would enter Bardere tomorrow,
and secure Hoddur at first light on Christmas Day.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary-general, again called
on Washington to disarm warlords and gangs in Somalia and said American
troops should fan out through the country and not limit themselves to the
hunger zones.
