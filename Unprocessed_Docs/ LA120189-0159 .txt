The Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. announced today it has signed an agreement with Pacific Dunlop Ltd. to jointly make steel cable conveyor belting and sell both steel cable and fabric conveyor belting in Australia. 
The belting is used primarily by the heavy mining industry and power stations. 
Company officials said the company, Tecbelt Pacific, will benefit from the technical strengths of Goodyear's global belting leadership and the local marketing and distribution expertise of Pacific Dunlop. 
Since 1987, Goodyear and Pacific Dunlop have been partners in South Pacific Tyres, which produces tires under the Goodyear, Dunlop and Olympic names in Australia and New Zealand.
