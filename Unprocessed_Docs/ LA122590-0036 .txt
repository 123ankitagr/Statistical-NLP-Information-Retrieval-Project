Christians (and others) who celebrate Christmas do not do so with the thought of imposing upon non-believers. It is a religious season of joy for Christians. 
The cant of the language employed by your correspondent indicated a general sympathy for those who felt put upon. The idea endorsed by your newspaper seems to be that Christians, by celebrating one of their principal feasts, are downright mean to those who are of a different religion or no religion. 
I suppose this is yet another one of the children of diversity and "multiculturalism." 
Well, fine. It seems to me that if you actually share this idea you are morally obligated not to accept any commercial advertising for the Christmas season.
