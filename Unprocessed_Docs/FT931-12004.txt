REPRESENTATIVES of the advertising and tobacco industries yesterday
condemned as fallacious and inadequately researched a government report that
says tobacco advertising plays a significant role in encouraging people to
smoke, Gary Mead writes.
The criticism came from the Advertising Association and the Tobacco Advisory
Council, which represents the main tobacco manufacturers.
In its response to the report the association said it had used invalid
evidence and had ignored international research that contradicted the
report's conclusions. It said the report:
'Reviewed only a small fraction of the evidence on the subject of the effect
of tobacco advertising on tobacco consumption.'
'Ignores the extensive literature relating to the basic question of how
advertising actually works.'
'Arrives at sweeping and unjustified conclusions based on a limited and
incomplete review of the available evidence.'
The association quoted a 1984 World Health Organisation study of smoking
behaviour among schoolchildren in Norway and Finland, where tobacco
advertising was banned, and Austria and the UK, where it was not. It
concluded: 'A difference (in smoking habits) might have been expected. No
such systematic differences are found'.
The Tobacco Advisory Council suggested in its response that the generally
accepted view of researchers was that children who smoked became aware of
advertising, while children who did not smoke ignored it.
In the UK about Pounds 60m annually is spent on tobacco advertising in the
press and on posters.
