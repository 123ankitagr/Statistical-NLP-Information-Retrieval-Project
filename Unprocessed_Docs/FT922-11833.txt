MR David Duke, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, yesterday abandoned his
quest for the Republican party's presidential nomination this year, writes
Jurek Martin, US Editor, in Washington.
Mr Duke's campaign has effectively been moribund since the Super Tuesday
primaries early in March, when his appeal to white southerners produced only
a minimal response.
He complained yesterday he had been kept off the ballot in many states.
Meanwhile, the New York Times reported yesterday that Mr Paul Tsongas, still
second to Mr Bill Clinton in accumulating Democratic party delegates,
suffered a previously unrevealed recurrence of cancer in 1987. Mr Tsongas
had made much of his recovery from the disease during his campaign.
