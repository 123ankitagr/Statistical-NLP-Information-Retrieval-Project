Miss West Virginia has been charged with brandishing a gun after an auto accident damaged the white sports coupe that came with her crown. 
Lisa Bittinger, a 19-year-old who came under fire after the Miss America Pageant for remarks deemed racist, was arrested with another motorist after the two swore out complaints against each other Tuesday, Police Chief Ed DeVito said. 
Bittinger and Tammy Boyce, 23, were freed on $200 bail. 
Bittinger said Boyce forced her 1989 Chevrolet Beretta off the road and into a utility pole, causing damage estimated by police at $4,000. Immediately afterward, Bittinger brandished a handgun, police said. 
The beauty queen came under fire earlier this year when she said, after failing to make the top 10: 
"If it's political, it's not my fault. If you look at the top 10, it's quite obvious. It was one black, one Korean, one Japanese, one hearing-impaired, one kidney implant, and of course Texas and Florida were part of the top 10. It makes you wonder."
