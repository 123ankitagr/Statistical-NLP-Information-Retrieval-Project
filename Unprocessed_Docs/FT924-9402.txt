BRAZILIAN IRON ore exports were down to 80.5m tonnes in the first nine
months of this year, compared with 87.3m tonnes for the same period last
year, according to figures released by the National Association of Iron and
Basic Metal Mining Industries, writes Bill Hinchberger in Sao Paulo.
Receipts for the period were Dollars 1.8bn, compared to Dollars 2bn last
year.
The state-owned Companhia Vale do Rio Doce, responsible for 55.7 per cent of
the country's iron ore output last year, saw its sales abroad drop for the
January-September period to 52m tonnes, from 58m tonnes.
The downturn was mainly due to lower demand in Japan, Germany, South Korea,
Italy, France and other principal markets, said Mr Antonio Henrique Senise,
the association's executive secretary. He also blamed reduced receipts on
lower prices, down by about 5 per cent in comparison with 1991.
Exports were expected to maintain the same rhythm for the rest of the year,
said Mr Senise. At that rate, Brazil's total iron ore exports for the year
will be about 108m tonnes, down from last year's 114.7m tonnes.
