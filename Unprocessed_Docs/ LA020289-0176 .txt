El Camino High School's basketball team earned a measure of revenge Wednesday. 
The seventh-ranked Wildcats beat San Pasqual, 77-66, in an Avocado League basketball game, avenging a 60-57 loss on Jan. 6. 
"We played 32 minutes of basketball this time," El Camino Coach Ray Johnson said. "Last time we didn't do that." 
San Pasqual kept pace with El Camino's furious tempo in the first half, but the Wildcats still took a 43-35 halftime lead. 
"We played at their pace in the first half," San Pasqual Coach Tom Buck said. "But you can't play their pace without scoring." 
The victory gave league-leading El Camino an 8-1 league record. San Pasqual dropped to 8-9, 5-4. 
San Pasqual took an 18-13 lead with less than a minute to play in the first period. But two free throws by Travis Gilley back-to-back baskets by Shaun Scurry and a two-pointer by Glen Ankton gave El Camino a 21-18 lead after the first period. 
San Pasqual stayed within 2 or 3 points most of the second quarter. With 1:21 left and after consecutive turnovers, El Camino's Dee Boyer blocked a shot by Erik Meek, was fouled, and made both free throws and the Wildcats led, 41-33. 
Boyer finished with a season-high 27 points and 11 rebounds. Ankton added 15 and Todd Swanson 12, with 14 assists, for El Camino. 
"Dee (Boyer) worked real hard tonight," Johnson said. "He had been trying to do too much last time. This time, he let it happen." 
Meek, San Pasqual's leading scorer all season, and teammate Roger Hill had 18 points apiece. KIM Q. BERKSHIRE
