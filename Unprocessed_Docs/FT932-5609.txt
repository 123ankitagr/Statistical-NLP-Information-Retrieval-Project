TAIWAN is considering a package of financial incentives and other measures
to expand its export processing zones, the government's Export Processing
Zone Administration said yesterday, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The Commercial Times newspaper quoted officials as saying the package would
include the lifting of remaining restrictions on imports into the zones.
This would reduce import costs by 20-30 per cent, helping exporters to
increase competitiveness in the world market, the newspaper said.
The administration would also upgrade infrastructure in the zones and
maintain factory leasing rates at low levels.
The 242 factories operating in Taiwan's three export processing zones
registered combined exports of Dollars 4.7bn (Pounds 3.05bn) in 1992. In
recent months, government officials have expressed concern that weakness in
the global economy is hurting Taiwan's export sector.
