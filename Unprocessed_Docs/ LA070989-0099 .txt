The U.S. Postal Service has purchased the 70,750-square-foot Cal Fame Building in Escondido for $2.65 million. Grubb & Ellis' North San Diego County district office negotiated for the seller, Paramount Citrus Assn. 
The 55-year-old building at 1155 W. Mission Ave. has been used as an orange packing house since it was constructed in 1934 by the Sunkist Packing Co. 
The fate of the building is undecided, according to the Postal Service spokesman, who said the agency may occupy the building or tear it down to make way for a new structure.
