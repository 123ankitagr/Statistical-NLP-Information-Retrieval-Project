The son of former heavyweight boxing champion Joe Frazier has been sentenced in Philadelphia to up to 3 1/2 years in prison for stealing a bicycle. 
Hector Frazier, 28, also was placed on five years' probation Friday. Frazier pleaded guilty to stealing the bicycle, burglarizing a business and stealing two cars. 
During the court proceedings, Frazier apologized to William Neri, 11, for stealing his bicycle and taking $3 from his pocket Jan. 28. 
"I'm really sorry for what I did. It just wasn't me. I need help," Frazier said.
