THE first Japanese trade mission to Europe of semiconductor users has
arrived in Paris to teach European microchip manufacturers a few tricks on
how to sell their goods in the fiercely competitive Japanese market.
'I believe the Japanese semiconductor market is open and freely accessible,'
said Mr Nobuo Kanoi, executive deputy president of Sony, the Japanese
consumer electronics and entertainment group, who is heading the mission.
Poor communication has meant Europeans are not well enough informed of
Japanese market needs while the Japanese often do not know what Europe has
to offer.
Europe's share of the Japanese chip market is estimated at between 1-3 per
cent. This compares with about 16 per cent of the European market held by
Japanese companies, according to Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
As well as insufficient information about what Japanese users require,
European suppliers are hampered by a lack of recognition in Japan. They also
need to meet Japanese standards in terms of delivery and after-sales
service.
For example, Sony has difficulty obtaining European components for
miniaturised consumer electronics products, such as the Walkman, which are
key Sony products, said Mr Klaus Wangerin, general manager of European
procurement at Sony Europe.
Mr Ernie Pusey, sales and marketing director of GEC Plessey Semiconductors,
the UK company, believes the secret of success in Japan 'is having Japanese
people on the ground employed by your company'. Engineers who speak Japanese
are crucial.
Having unique products also helps. GEC, which manufactures specialised
rather than commodity products, has seen sales in Japan double to about 4
per cent of total turnover and expects the same in the current year.
So far there is no official target for European market share in Japan,
although an unofficial figure of 5 per cent is talked about.
