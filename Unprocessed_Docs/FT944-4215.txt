Jerry Brand, 37, who runs the privately-owned Brand Group, a fast-growing
contract caterer, has taken a step closer to fulfilling his stock market
ambitions by recruiting his first independent non-executive director -
Stirling Gallacher.
Gallacher, 62, was managing director of Gardner Merchant Caterers, the
industry leader, in the mid-1970s and went on to do the same job at
Sutcliffe Catering, another of the big three UK contract caters. He retired
as chairman of Sutcliffe in 1992 after Granada had bought the company.
Brand started his own catering company in 1988 and annual turnover has grown
from Pounds 670,000 to Pounds 30m in the current year, with Pounds 40m
budgeted for next year. Brand expects to make pre-tax profits of Pounds
600,000 in 1994 and is hoping to get his company floated on the stock market
by 1996. He says that he is looking for an additional non-executive director
with financial experience.
