Production from Britain's North Sea oil wells reached its highest level for
six years, Royal Bank of Scotland said yesterday.
The bank's monthly oil index report shows production in September at its
highest level since April 1988 - an average 2.57m barrels a day.
The rise came as several fields re-started after maintenance shutdowns.
The increase meant that even though oil prices are low, oil and gas output
has increased by Pounds 5m a day on the same period a year ago, Royal Bank
of Scotland said.
