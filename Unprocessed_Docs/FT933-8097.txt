South Korea has asked Israel to stop seeking an improvement in relations
with North Korea until suspicions about Pyongyang's nuclear programme are
resolved, writes John Burton in Seoul.
The South Korean request followed a meeting between Israeli and North Korean
officials last week in Beijing.
Israel has held talks with North Korea to persuade it to stop supplying
Scud-C missiles to Syria and Iran. The tempo of contacts has increased
following North Korea's successful test firing in May of its Rodong-I
ballistic missile. North Korea reportedly has agreed to sell the missile to
Iran. The Rodong-I could reach Israel from western Iran.
