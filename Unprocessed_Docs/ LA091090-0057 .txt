The International Amateur Athletics Federation called on South African and African representatives to consider returning South Africa to international track and field competition. 
The appeal came a week after Juan Antonio Samaranch, president of the International Olympic Committee, said that the IOC would await a recommendation from African nations on whether South Africa would be readmitted to the Olympic Games.
