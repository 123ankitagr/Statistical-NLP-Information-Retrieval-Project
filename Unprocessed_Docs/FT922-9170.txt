REPUBLIC Pictures, a small independent film producer and distributor that
also owns a large home video distribution business, has become the latest
company to offer itself as the saviour of Orion Pictures, the independent
Hollywood studio that filed under US bankruptcy law last year.
The bid from Republic  - which would offer Orion creditors a complex package
of cash and equity measures  - comes just two weeks after New Line Cinema
ended it efforts to rescue and acquire the troubled Orion.
New Line, another independent, said the kinds of demands made were too
difficult.
Orion, the studio that became famous for its nurturing of Woody Allen, filed
last December for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of US
bankruptcy law.
At the time of its filing Orion  - 68 per cent owned by Mr John Kluge's
Metromedia group  - had been troubled by nearly Dollars 700m of debts and a
severe cash crunch.
Republic Pictures would take over Dollars 400m of commitments to creditors
by Orion and would offer creditors a secured interest-bearing note of
Dollars 150m to be issued by the merged company. Republic would also offer
creditors 10 per cent of the common stock of the merged company.
Mr Paul Wagner, an Orion executive, said the Republic offer 'looks good on
the surface' and would be reviewed by the company. Any such deal would
require the approval of Orion, its creditors and the New York bankruptcy
court.
In its 1991 fiscal year Orion lost Dollars 102.1m. In its last quarterly
results Orion lost Dollars 29.2m on revenues of Dollars 94.8m. Republic
Pictures made a net profit of less than Dollars 1m in fiscal 1991 on
revenues of Dollars 81.6m.
