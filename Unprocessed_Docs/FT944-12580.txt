Canary Wharf, the London Docklands development company, is to appeal against
a High Court ruling earlier this year in an action brought by a group of
Docklands residents claiming damages for interference with television
reception.
Canary Wharf maintains that interference with television reception should
not be an actionable nuisance under English law. If the ruling is allowed to
stand it could result in similar actions against existing developments, and
could threaten urban regeneration and city-centre developments, the company
says.
It says interference with television reception is analogous with loss of
view, citing an 1881 case that there is no right to a view under English law
otherwise 'there could be no great towns'.
