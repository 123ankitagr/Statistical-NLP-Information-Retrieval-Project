A lawyer for the family of police cadet Timothy Shepard, who died after collapsing on the first day of training, said Friday that a settlement has been reached in a lawsuit against the state. 
He said the agreement did not allow him to disclose the terms. 
Shepard and 15 other recruits became ill during the first day of training, a hot day in September, 1988, at the Agawam training academy. Shepard died two months later. The incident led to changes in the way the state trains officers.
