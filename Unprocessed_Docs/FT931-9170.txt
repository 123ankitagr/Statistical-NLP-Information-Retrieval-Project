CAR WORKERS at Peugeot Talbot in Coventry have been called out on strike
from next Monday over pay and conditions, unions announced yesterday .
The 3,500 manual workers at the company's main production plant last week
rejected a two-year pay offer comprising a 3.5 per cent increase this year,
and the greater of a 3.5 per cent or inflation increase in 1994.
The workforce voted last week by 2,300 to 859 in favour of a strike, said
the TGWU general union, the main union involved. The strike announcement
followed the breakdown of talks with management, said union officials.
Mr Tony Woodley, TGWU national motor industry secretary and leader of the
Peugeot Talbot manual workers, said unions had been seeking a package which
included a guarantee of job security.
Negotiations had been complicated by company attempts to cut rest periods,
said Mr Woodley. Management confirmed it wanted to reduce paid 'relief' time
from 42 minutes a shift to 30 minutes - separate half-hour lunch breaks are
unpaid.
Mr Woodley said there had been a 30 per cent increase in productivity in
less than three years. 'We feel strongly that the time has come to reward
that contribution,' he added.
Peugeot Talbot said yesterday it did not want to comment on the threatened
strike and that no further talks with unions had been scheduled.
