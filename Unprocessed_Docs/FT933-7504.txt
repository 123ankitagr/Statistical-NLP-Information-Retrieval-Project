GROWTH in German money supply has exceeded the target range set by the
Bundesbank for the fourth consecutive month.
According to provisional figures, M3 - which comprises cash in circulation
as well as savings and short-term time deposits - grew at 7.5 per cent in
July on an annualised, seasonally adjusted basis. This follows growth of 7
per cent in June and compares with a target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent.
Although the headline figure was in line with the expectations of
economists, there was disappointment about a sharp, 8 per cent rise in bank
credits to companies and private individuals over the past six months.
This is an increase from the 7.6 per cent growth rate in the six months to
July. Economists said that the August M3 was likely to climb still higher,
reflecting Bundesbank currency interventions.
The disappointing July M3 figure was released just a week before the
Bundesbank's policy-making council meets on August 26 to consider whether
monetary conditions warrant additional interest rate cuts. Yesterday Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, warned of the 'grave
disruptions' which can occur on financial markets if high expectations of
interest rate cuts are not fulfilled.
In remarks reported by a German news agency, he said that the currency
market upheaval of recent weeks 'should make it clear to everyone' what
happens when markets are fed with unrealistic expectations.
Alice Rawsthorn in Paris adds: Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European
Commission, yesterday criticised Chancellor Helmut Kohl for suggesting that
the EC might have to delay the timetable for monetary union. Mr Delors said
that the chancellor's remarks had 'added to the doubts' on monetary union.
