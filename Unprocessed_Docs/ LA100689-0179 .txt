Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. said today that he hopes federal disaster officials react faster to the next national disaster than they did in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. 
Riley said he met with top Federal Emergency Management Agency officials and found them sincere, but called the disaster relief law "grossly inadequate" and the response to the emergency too slow. 
"I hope next time a national disaster hits this country, the government will have a better response," Riley said. "I would be shirking my responsiblity and be less honest if I didn't say what I felt." 
"When the rubble is clear, we will work with Congress for a better law and a better response," the mayor said.
