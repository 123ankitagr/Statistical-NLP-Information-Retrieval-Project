A man who had been held for questioning in the deaths of three transients whose bodies were found in a fire at a boarded-up bar in Torrance was released by police Sunday morning after it was determined the blaze was probably accidental. 
The unidentified man was booked on suspicion of murder and arson shortly after the fire broke out Saturday morning at the Key Largo Bar at 17430 Prairie Ave. He was released at about 9 a.m. 
Names of the victims, three men in their mid-20s, were not released pending positive identification by the coroner's office.
