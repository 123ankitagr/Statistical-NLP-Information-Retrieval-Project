Peter Benton, a former director general of the British Institute of
Management, is to become chairman of Enterprise Adventure, a database that
aims to bring together private investors and small companies seeking early
stage finance.
Enterprise Adventure is a subsidiary of Enterprise Support Group, where
Benton is already chairman. The group works with the Department of Trade and
Industry on the government's Enterprise Initiative, funding for which is
running out later this year.
Enterprise Adventure hopes to provide business angels with an on-line
database of private companies seeking development and expansion capital.
