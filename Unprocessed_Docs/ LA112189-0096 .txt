Live Entertainment Inc. said it needs more time to find a replacement for Jose E. Menendez, its slain chairman and chief executive. 
Menendez and his wife Kitty were killed Aug. 20 at their home in Beverly Hills. Police are continuing to investigate the case, but no arrests have been made. 
Live, a distributor and retailer of video and audio entertainment, announced several appointments and the creation of a new unit for acquisitions and new business, Live Enterprises Inc. 
Devendra Mishra, executive vice president-operations, has been named president and chief operating officer of Live. Meshra, prior to joining Live three years ago, worked for RCA for 18 years. 
Live said Chief Financial Officer Roger R. Smith, who was named acting president of Live following the death of Menendez, has been named president of the new unit. 
The company said it was continuing to search for a successor but warned that the process may take a while. 
"This search is not expected to be concluded quickly, and the management structure announced today is seen as extremely capable of handling all aspects of the company's business, however long it takes to find a new chief executive officer," said Peter Hoffman, acting chairman and chief executive. 
The company also announced appointments of two well-known entertainment executives to its board: Alan Hirschfield, former chief executive at 20th Century Fox and Columbia Pictures Industries; and Cy Leslie, founder of Pickwick International and founder of MGM/UA Home Entertainment Group.
