Question: I find it to be very helpful when you write about risk factors for different diseases, such as diabetes. Have you ever done this for young people who may be suicidal? 
Answer: Possible risk factors for suicide among the young include loss of a parent; family disruption, such as separation or divorce; emotional stress; a history of abuse, neglect, or both; having a family member or friend who committed suicide; previous suicide attempts; a history of alcohol or drug abuse or a family member with a history of drug dependency; and access to firearms.
