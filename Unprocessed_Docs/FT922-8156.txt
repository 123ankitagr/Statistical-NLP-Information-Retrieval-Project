A steady fall in export prices for commodities is punishing people who are
'already on the margins of a decent human existence,' according to Rev
Charles Elliott, one of the UK's leading development economists and former
head of Christian Aid, writes David Dodwell, World Trade Editor.
In a speech to be given in London last night, marking the 50th anniversary
of Oxfam, the UK aid organisation, Mr Elliott argued that the international
commodity price system 'has been a powerful process whereby wealth and
income have been transferred from commodity producers to commodity
importers/manufacturing exporters'. He said the import purchasing power of
developing countries had fallen by 2 per cent a year since 1950 as a result
of this process.
