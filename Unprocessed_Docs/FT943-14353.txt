Overseas investment by Taiwanese companies rose rapidly in the first half of
this year. The government approved Dollars 936.3m in investments by local
companies in countries other than China during the first six months of this
year, a 54 per cent jump from the Dollars 606.8m (Pounds 399m) recorded in
1993.
But January-June approvals for investment in China were sharply lower,
amounting to only Dollars 434.7m against Dollars 3.6bn for 1993, according
to the economic ministry's investment commission.
Analysts attributed the steep decline to China's economic clampdown imposed
last year and tensions generated by the March 31 killings of 24 Taiwanese on
a pleasure boat tour.
It was also noted that China had largely discarded the preferential
treatment accorded to Taiwan firms in the form of tax breaks and other
incentives.
Meanwhile, government-approved inward investment in the first half climbed
49 per cent from a year earlier to Dollars 639.1m. The petrochemical, food
and services sectors recorded the largest gains.
Analysts cautioned that the outward investment figures were an indicator of
investment interest by private-sector Taiwan firms but were skewed because
they do not include the substantial offshore activities of state-run firms.
South-East Asian countries continued to be a magnet for Taiwanese cash, with
Malaysia topping the list at Dollars 101.5m, up from Dollars 42.2m during
the first six months of last year. The commission approved investments of
Dollars 39.1m in Thailand, versus Dollars 19.2m in 1993.
An important beneficiaries of Taiwanese investment is Europe, officials
said, via the British Virgin Islands, from which Taiwanese may invest in the
EC tax-free. Investment in the 'other areas' category hit Dollars 637.9m in
the first half, up from Dollars 120.9m in 1993.
