TWO of Europe's biggest electronics groups, Siemens of Germany and
Thomson-CSF of France, are joining forces to bid for the contract for the
new integrated European air traffic control system.
The two have for some time been in talks over the terms of their joint
venture: it will be handled by Siemens' air traffic control management
division and by its French partner's defence and control systems subsidiary.
Europe air traffic is notoriously congested. Officials at the Inter-national
Air Transport Association (Iata) have warned that the network faces
'meltdown' in which a technical hitch could lead to delays bad enough to
leave pilots aircraft stranded at the wrong airports.
Iata and Eurocontrol, the Brussels-based body responsible for co-ordinating
air traffic control across the continent, are working together to establish
an improved air traffic control system by 1995-6.
Siemens and Thomson-CSF are likely to face stiff competition for the
contract from IBM, the US computer company. The initial contract, estimated
to be worth FFr500m (Pounds 52m), involves supplying 500 work stations for
the air traffic controllers under the aegis of Eurocontrol.
The long-term project could be worth between FFr10bn and FFr20bn over the
next 10 to 15 years.
Thomson-CSF has won contracts recently for air traffic control equipment at
Athens airport and in the Commonwealth of Independent States.
