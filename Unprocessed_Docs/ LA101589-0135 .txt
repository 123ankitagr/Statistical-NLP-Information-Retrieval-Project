Pete Rose, already suspended from baseball and under investigation by a federal grand jury, will be investigated by the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, officials said. 
The department confirmed it raided a Staten Island, N.Y., sports memorabilia company named Pete Rose Hit King Marketing Friday. Apparently confiscated were bats, balls, hats, clothing and other articles. 
The Postal Inspection Service is investigating complaints that the company used the promise of Rose autographs to solicit business for the company, then did not deliver. 
The exact nature of Rose's affiliation with the company "is yet to be determined," inspector Mary Flynn said. "We don't know." 
A spokesperson for Rose said Rose neither has any financial interest in the company nor does he share in its profits. She also said the company did not carry Rose's name, but Flynn said stationary had "Pete Rose Hit King Marketing" on its letterhead.
