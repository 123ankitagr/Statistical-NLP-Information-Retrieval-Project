A French judge has issued international arrest warrants against four gunmen
of the radical Palestinian group led by Abu Nidal over a 1988 attack on a
ferry in the Aegean Sea in which nine tourists, including three French
people, died, according to justice officials, agencies report from Paris.
The warrants charged four Palestinians with murder and attempted murder in
the attack on the vessel, City of Poros, on July 11, 1988.
