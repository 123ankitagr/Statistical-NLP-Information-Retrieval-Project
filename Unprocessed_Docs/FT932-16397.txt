The first public outing of the new team running ITN, which supplies
Britain's commercial television networks with news programmes, should have
been a happier occasion than it was.
David Gordon, 51, the new chief executive who has just jumped ship from The
Economist, acknowledged that he did not know much about television but knew
a lot of people who do; ITN stalwart Stewart Purvis, 45, recently promoted
to editor in chief, positively bristled when one hack asked about rumours of
internal disciplinary hearings concerning expenses irregularities; and
Michael Green, 45, the UK's latest rising media boss and ITN chairman,
brushed aside a follow-up question on possible staff cuts.
'The days when you could write about 'the troubled ITN' are gone,' stressed
Purvis. Another over-hasty news judgment, perhaps?
