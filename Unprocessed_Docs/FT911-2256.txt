INTERNATIONAL Computers (ICL), the UK-based information technology company
in which Fujitsu of Japan has a majority stake, has formed a new joint
venture company specialising in computer disaster standby services.
Its partner is Sherwood Computer Services, a Gloucester-based company which
specialises in computer systems for the insurance market.
Computer disaster recovery services involve providing a fully equipped data
processing centre which a concern struck by fire, flood or other disasters
can take over at a moment's notice.
Heightened awareness that many companies run the risk of going out of
business if their computers are put out of action has encouraged computing
services companies to believe disaster recovery would be a strong growth
sector.
However, the recession has dampened those expectations and price competition
has been fierce.
Sherwood had been looking for a partner to share the costs and risks of its
existing disaster recovery business for some months to enable it to
concentrate on its core business: its disaster recovery service made losses
before tax of Pounds 242,000 on revenues of Pounds 2.7m last year, leaving
the company with pre-tax profits of Pounds 2m.
The deal is subject to options giving Sherwood the right to require ICL to
acquire its shareholding in 1994 for a maximum of Pounds 975,000 and ICL the
right to require Sherwood to sell its shareholding in 1996 for a maximum of
Pounds 1.5m.
