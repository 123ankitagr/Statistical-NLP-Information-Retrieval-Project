Nasr El Arab, the high weight and early favorite, drew post position 7 today as 11 thoroughbreds were entered for Sunday's $1-million Santa Anita Handicap. 
Trainer Charlie Whittingham, who also has Payant and Frankly Perfect among the competitors for the $550,000 winner's purse, said the post positions should make little difference in a 1 1/4-mile race. Nasr El Arab, with early odds of 5-2, must carry high weight of 124, conceding from two to 12 pounds to his rivals. 
In post position order the entries were Stylish Winner, Payant, Good Taste, Super Diamond, Perceive Arrogance, Stalwars, Nasr El Arab, Martial Law, Frankly Perfect, Triteamtri and Cherokee Colony.
