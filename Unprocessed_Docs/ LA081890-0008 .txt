A man who killed a teen-age girl before taking his own life early this month may also have attacked four women in the foothills near Stanford University, police said. Robert Michel Christy, 28, shot himself to death in his car soon after killing 17-year-old Stephanie LeDoux in Rocklin on Aug. 3. 
Stanford police said he may have been the "foothill rapist," wanted for one rape and three rape attempts that appear to have been connected. No motive has been established for the killing of LeDoux, who was returning home from a date when she apparently got into an altercation with Christy. Stanford police Capt. Raoul Niemeyer said Christy was "linked definitely" to one of the attempted rapes because he left behind his eyeglasses and a distinctive folding knife.
