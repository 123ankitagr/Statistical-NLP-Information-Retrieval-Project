The City Council has named Denise Ovrom as acting city manager, pending a permanent appointment to the post. 
Ovrom, who has been Brea's assistant city manager for 5 years, said Wednesday she is applying for the position. The post became vacant last week when Edward G. Wohlenberg resigned in order to become city manager of Vallejo in Northern California. Ovrom, 38, was named to the post on Tuesday. 
Before coming to Brea, she was an assistant to the city manager and finance director in Claremont.
