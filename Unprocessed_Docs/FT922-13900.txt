THE New Zealand Commerce Commission, the monopolies watchdog, has cleared
Tasman Steel, Broken Hill Proprietary's subsidiary, to buy New Zealand
Steel, Reuter reports from Wellington.
BHP already owns 31 per cent and said it wanted to buy complete control.
Other shareholders have said they are willing sellers.
'The commission is satisfied that the acquisition will not result, or will
not be likely to result, in the acquisition or strengthening of a dominant
position in New Zealand steel markets,' said Ms Susan Lojkine, commission
chairman.
BHP still must get clearance from Australia's monopolies watchdog, the Trade
Practices Commission, to proceed with the purchase.
Fisher & Paykel Industries and Steel & Tube Holdings last week sold their
non-voting shares in NZ Steel to BHP for NZDollars 47.75m (USDollars 26.1m)
and NZDollars 26m respectively. Each owns 25 per cent of the voting shares
and said they would sell them to BHP once given approval.
Australia and New Zealand Banking (ANZ) said it was willing to sell its 19
per cent stake and had held preliminary talks with BHP, but had not received
an offer.
The New Zealand commission said that imports imposed an effective
competitive restraint on NZ Steel.
Fisher & Paykel said NZ Steel had performed disappointingly since the
Helenus consortium bought into it for NZDollars 323m in 1989 and that it
would require fresh capital.
NZ Steel, backed by government-guaranteed loans, underwent expansion in the
late 1980s but the government had to bail it out to the tune of NZDollars
1.5bn in 1987. The government sold it to Equiticorp International for
NZDollars 327m. Equiticorp later collapsed and it was sold it to Helenus.
Ms Lojkine said the commission acknowledged concerns of Australian steel
suppliers. But it only had to assess proposals in terms of New Zealand
markets, she said.
