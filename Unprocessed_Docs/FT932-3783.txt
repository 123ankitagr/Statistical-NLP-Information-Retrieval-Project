DR Mahathir Mohamad (above), Malaysia's prime minister, leaves on a 10-day
visit to China this weekend, along with more than 300 business people and
officials, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur.
The delegation, one of the largest ever to go to China, will tour several
industrial sites and sign a number of agreements with Chinese corporations.
Dr Mahathir is scheduled to meet Mr Li Peng, China's prime minister, early
next week. Mr Li has not been seen in public for more than six weeks and
there have been reports that he has been seriously ill.
Malaysia's policy towards China has changed considerably recently. Malaysia
was once deeply suspicious of what it saw as China's potential influence
over Malaysia's large Chinese community and the two countries are among
rival claimants to the Spratly islands in the South China Sea. Malaysia and
China recently agreed to co-operate on the Spratlys issue. Malaysia has also
called for China's inclusion in any emerging security framework in the south
Asia region.
'China is currently and has every reason to continue to be a benign power,'
said Mr Mohamad Najib, Malaysia's defence minister, recently.
While Dr Mahathir has been urging Malaysia's businesspeople to seek business
opportunities in China there is some concern in Kuala Lumpur that foreign
investors are moving their funds away from Malaysia and into China.
Trade between China and Malaysia has grown four-fold in the past five years
to reach Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 1.19bn) in 1992.
