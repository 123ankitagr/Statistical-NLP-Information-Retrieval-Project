New England Patriots wide receiver Hart Lee Dykes, who suffered an eye injury in a brawl outside a nightclub, should be ready to play in the Patriots' next game, his doctor said today. 
The team was more cautious, saying it was too early to discuss Dykes' status. 
He was expected to be released from the hospital today. 
"He is dramatically better than he was yesterday," ophthalmologist Robert Bahr said after examining Dykes at Rhode Island Hospital. "He's feeling better and he's seeing better." 
Dykes and teammate Irving Fryar were injured early Wednesday in an altercation outside Club Shalimar. Fryar, who pulled a handgun to stop the assault, said people were beating and kicking Dykes. 
Dykes' eye was swollen and he was kept overnight at the hospital for observation, Bahr said. 
"He's going to probably have to take it easy for a while," Bahr said, adding he expected Dykes to be able to play Oct. 18 against Miami. The Patriots have a bye this week.
