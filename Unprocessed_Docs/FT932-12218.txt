Sir, What a delight it was to read Richard Needham's letter (April 21).
Professional exporters throughout the country will welcome the fact that -
at last - a British government minister has recognised reality.
Too often, as the minister for trade pointed out, senior managers of British
companies ignore the real professionalism, the specialised knowledge and
training, and the particular skills that are required of their export staff.
Too often managing directors and finance directors see export as something
at which 'to have a crack' when the domestic market is depressed, with no
thought for strategic planning and long-term goals.
Too often recruitment advertisements for export sales and marketing staff
place emphasis on specific product knowledge (which can be learned in-house
in the new company) and ignore relevant professional export qualifications
and languages.
Too often, jobs columns feature salaries of Pounds 50,000 for life insurance
or IT system sales people, and Pounds 25,000 for export sales staff expected
to cover half the world and make on-the-spot decisions which can affect the
company's entire annual profitability.
Well said, Mr Needam. Let us get serious about exporting. Ian Campbell,
