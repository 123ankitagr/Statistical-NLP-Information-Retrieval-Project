El Salvador's former president, Jose Napoleon Duarte, has returned $113,200 to the nation's treasury that the Finance Ministry contends was money intended to aid victims of a 1986 earthquake, according to a top-ranking member of the Christian Democratic Party, of which Duarte was a member. "Indeed, the former president deposited that sum in the nation's treasury, through his attorney Pablo Mauricio Alvergue," said Eduardo Colindres. The government-run daily newspaper El Diario de Hoy confirmed the repayment. On July 7, the Finance Ministry filed a legal demand against Duarte, saying he embezzled the money.
