Police have arrested a convicted child molester on suspicion of violating his probation by being unsupervised in the company of a 14-year-old girl. 
John Pizzini, 30, of Costa Mesa was arrested Thursday at an undisclosed Costa Mesa residence, police said. 
Pizzini, who pleaded guilty to four counts of molesting a 14-year-old girl earlier this year, was released from jail in October after serving a three-month sentence. 
He was placed on three years' probation, which required him to register with police as a sex offender and stay away from minors. 
On Wednesday, the Orange County district attorney's office asked for an investigation into whether Pizzini violated his probation by hiring minors to sell candy bars.
