Question: I recall being told that a person's blood pressure should add up to 100 plus his age. The reason given me for this was that as a person grows older, he needs a higher blood pressure in order for his blood to get to all parts of his body. 
Therefore, a 60-year-old man, for example, should have a blood pressure of 160. Do you go along with this reasoning? 
Answer: High blood pressure is not normal, regardless of the patient's age. If a patient of mine had a systolic pressure of 160, I would consider ways to reduce it, whether by pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic means. 
Q: Does having a sore throat mean that you have a cold? 
A: A viral illness, such as a cold or the flu, is a common cause of a sore throat. However, Dr. Paul Cook, an expert on throat problems, says that several conditions can account for it, including allergies, irritation due to smoking or other environmental pollutants, and even excessive yelling.
