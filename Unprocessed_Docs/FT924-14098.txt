TAX INCENTIVES would en-courage companies to invest in research and
development far more effectively than current government schemes, according
to a survey published today by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm.
The firm's high-technology practice polled 324 companies in the sector. It
found 86 per cent in favour of a so-called 'negative-tax incentive' over the
grant system, which they said was too project-specific.
Negative tax would include companies that do not pay tax, but the survey was
not designed to come up with detailed policy proposals.
Mr Nick Ward, KPMG tax specialist, said some high-technology companies found
the government grant system too restrictive. 'They would prefer help in some
way through the tax system,' he said. 'This would give them greater freedom
to pursue perceived market needs in setting R&D priorities, rather than
tailoring their research to meet government's conditions for grant
assistance.'
