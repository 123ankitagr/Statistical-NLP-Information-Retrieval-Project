A nearly 4-week-old fire in the Okefenokee Swamp mushroomed to 11,000 acres Thursday, and a spokesman for the Okefenokee Wildlife Refuge said firefighters abandoned the swamp to let it burn so that they could build fire lines to protect stands of nearby commercial pine trees. The fire was started by lightning Sept. 1.
