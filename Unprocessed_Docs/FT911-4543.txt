THE COMBINED pre-tax profit of Finland's publicly quoted forest groups fell
by over 60 per cent in 1990 when compared with 1989, according to the
Central Association of Finnish Forest Industries, writes Enrique Tessieri.
Mr Heikki Parnanen, a CAFFI vice-president, blamed the poor result of the
country's forest groups on high labour and production costs. He said that
the industry's debt level was also a big strain.
