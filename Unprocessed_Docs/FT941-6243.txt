Star TV, the Asian broadcasting giant 63.6 per cent owned by Mr Rupert
Murdoch's News Corporation, has averted a legal dispute with Wharf Cable,
the fledgling Hong Kong network, by announcing it will not enforce a
nine-month old agreement to supply programming to the cable operator.
The move ends months of wrangling, which culminated in January when Wharf
took court action to scrap its licensing agreement, under which it is
required to screen four premium channels and three existing Star channels -
MTV, the BBC World Service and Prime Sport.
Wharf started proceedings against Star after seven months spent 'attempting
to conclude an agreement with successive Star TV managements'.
Mr Gary Davey, the third chief executive of Star TV in six months, said:
'Star TV has reluctantly come to the conclusion that a workable relationship
with Wharf Cable is simply not possible under the present agreement.
'We are hopeful that by taking this action the whole issue will be looked at
in a less contentious manner and help us move forward in finding a way to
make these services available to Hong Kong viewers.'
Wharf Cable said it was sorry to see Star's plans to launch new regional pay
TV services will be further delayed and noted that in order to continue to
expand viewers' choice it would endeavour to source quality channels from a
wide range of other regional providers as well.
Shell Electric Manufacturing, a Hong Kong electric-appliance maker, reported
net profits of HKDollars 139.6m (USDollars 18.1m) for the year to October 31
1993, up 73 per cent on the previous year.
Revenues totalled HKDollars 1.3bn, against HKDollars 1.2bn, and second-half
dividend is raised to 11.5 cents from 8 cents.
