INSURANCE companies which sell policies directly to the public by telephone
are poised to double their share of the Pounds 6.1bn UK motor insurance
market over the next five years, according to a survey by the London-based
GSR group.
It estimates that 'direct writers' - which cut out the industry's
traditional middlemen - will sell two in every five motor insurance policies
by 1998.
In 1992 the three biggest direct writers - Direct Line, Churchill and The
Insurance Service - spent Pounds 5.6m on advertising, just under 25 per cent
of an industry total of Pounds 29m.
Swinton Insurance and AA Insurance, the two biggest chains of insurance
brokers, which also sell policies by telephone, spent Pounds 6.53m in 1992.
The UK market for non-life insurance to be published in June by IFT
Marketing Research, a division of the GSR Group, 361-373 City Road, London
EC1V 1JJ. Pounds 595.
