Blowing Robert Taylor's name off his building at Lorimar and renaming it for George Cukor has its spiritual antecedent in the Soviet Union, when St. Petersburg became Leningrad. 
Had Taylor named American Nazis and not Communists, our current but philosophically dated Hollywood cadre would be giving award dinners in his name.
