The city has settled a two-year lawsuit filed by a former Cudahy city manager who charged that his employment contract had been unjustly terminated. 
John F. Porter, who was fired in September, 1986, after the first year of a five-year contract, was given a $225,000 settlement by the city earlier this month. 
City officials argued that the contract was too long and denied future City Councils the right to hire city staff members of their choice. A Superior Court judge ruled in the city's favor, but an appeals court recently overturned the decision.
