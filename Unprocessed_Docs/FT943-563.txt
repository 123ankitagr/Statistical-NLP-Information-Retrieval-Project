Patients with severe mental illness are being pushed out of London
hospitals, posing a possible risk to the public, the government's Mental
Health Taskforce said yesterday.
A severe shortage of emergency hospital beds in the capital meant that
patients were being discharged early to make way for others even more
chronically ill, it said.
In many cases there was little community support waiting. The taskforce
found that health authorities in many districts did not know how many
mentally ill they were responsible for.
Mr Alan Langlands, NHS chief executive, said: 'We recognise there are very
great pressures on mental health services in London. We are determined to
ensure action to deliver better services for patients.'
