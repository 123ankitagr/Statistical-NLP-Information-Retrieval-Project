Mervell Herren, city clerk in the Northern California town of Foster City, will become Pasadena city clerk effective Oct. 23. 
Herren was chosen from among 30 applicants and was one of five finalists interviewed by the Board of Directors for the $55,000-a-year post. 
She replaces Pasadena's former city clerk, Pam Swift, who resigned July 7 to assume an executive management position with Management Services Institute, a government consulting firm in La Mirada. 
A former legal secretary for 12 years for the Port of Oakland, Herren worked in Foster City as deputy city clerk for nine years before serving as city clerk for six years. In 1984, she became a certified municipal clerk, a professional designation from the International Institute of Municipal Clerks, based in Pasadena. 
She is pursuing a degree in public administration and has attended Pacific University in Forest Grove., Ore., and the College of San Mateo in San Mateo.
