Efforts continued yesterday through the conciliation service Acas to find
common ground for a resumption of negotiations to resolve the railway
signalling dispute with no sign of any breakthrough.
Both the RMT transport union and Railtrack, the company that owns and runs
the railway system, remain willing to talk but Acas officials have not yet
found an agreed form of words that can bring them back to the negotiating
table.
