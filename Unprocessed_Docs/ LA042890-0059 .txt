"LADDER OF SWORDS"(Great Britain, 1989; Director: Norman Hull; Century Plaza, 6:45 p.m.). A husband-wife circus act on the skids in the British moors may not sound like a promising premise for a movie, but this debut feature is engagingly scruffy. The wayward lives it depicts are viewed without condescension. (Peter Rainer)
