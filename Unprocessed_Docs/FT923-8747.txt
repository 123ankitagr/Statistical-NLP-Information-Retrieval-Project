CHINA plans to open the banking market of the country's most prosperous
province, Guangdong, to foreign banks, the Beijing-controlled China News
Service (CNS) reported yesterday.
CNS said the People's Bank of China (PBC), the country's central bank, had
decided to allow six foreign banks to set up branches in Guangzhou (Canton),
Guangdong's capital.
Foreign banks may now operate only in special economic zones in the south
and in Shanghai. They are not, however, permitted to raise deposits or lend
in renminbi, China's national currency.
The six banks have not been named, but CNS said the Guangdong provincial
branch of the central bank was completing the procedures for the approval.
The decision was made at a recent branch meeting in the province, it said.
'PBC has said that financial supervision should be strengthened in Guangdong
to allow financial markets to develop healthily,' said CNS.
Guangdong provincial authorities have been lobbying the central government
for some time to allow foreign banks to operate in the province. Guangdong
is the richest region in China and it has been estimated that residents have
unofficial US dollar holdings of more than Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.5bn).
