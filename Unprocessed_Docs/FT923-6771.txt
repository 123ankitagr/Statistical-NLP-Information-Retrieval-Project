TIME WARNER, the entertainment and publishing giant, and Viacom
International, a cable and broadcast television group, yesterday said they
had settled an anti-trust lawsuit linked to the 1989 merger between Time and
Warner.
Viacom, which had sought Dollars 2.4bn in damages from Time, said it would
receive material financial benefits from the settlement, in addition to
strategic advantages. Time Warner, which has not admitted any liability to
Viacom's claims, will pay Viacom an undisclosed cash sum.
Other terms of the settlement include wider distribution of Viacom's
Showtime and Movie channels on Time Warner's cable system, joint marketing
campaigns by Showtime and Time Warner's HBO and increased advertising
purchases by Time Warner companies on Viacom's MTV networks over the next
five years.
In addition, Time Warner will buy Viacom's Milwaukee cable system.
In the original suit, Viacom had alleged that Time Warner had used its power
as the second largest US operator of cable television networks to promote
its own pay-TV film services at the expense of Viacom's services. Viacom
charged that the uncompetitive acts, dating to at least 1980, would worsen
after the merger between Time and Warner.
