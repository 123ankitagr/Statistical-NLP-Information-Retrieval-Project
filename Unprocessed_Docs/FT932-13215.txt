New Zealand exports increased by 9.3 per cent to NZDollars 18.67bn (Pounds
6.5bn) in the 12 months to March 31, a record, the Statistics Department
reported yesterday, Terry Hall reports from Wellington. The figures are the
latest to point to a strong improvement in the New Zealand economy, which
economists say is due to a more competitive domestic market and a sharp fall
in the exchange rate over the past year. New Zealand showed a trade surplus
of NZDollars 1.69bn in the 12 months to March 31, NZDollars 354m lower than
the previous year.
