Tony Greener, chief executive of Guinness, who also takes over as chairman
from Sir Anthony Tennant in January, yesterday announced a series of senior
appointments designed to smooth the management transition at the
international drinks group.
Philip Yea (right), 37, finance director of Guinness Brewing Worldwide
(GBW), becomes group finance director (designate) and will progressively
take over the responsibilities of Ian Duncan, managing director, finance and
administration, who retires in the second half of next year.
Yea joined Guinness in 1984 and held a number of financial posts before
leaving in 1988 to become finance director of Cope Allman. He returned to
Guinness as director of financial control last year. Michael Kayser, GBW's
business development director, will replace Yea as GBW's finance director.
Brendan O'Neill (far right), 44, managing director for the past two years of
the international region of United Distil-lers (UD), the group's spirits
company, will switch to the brewing division in February as managing
director of GBW. O'Neill joined Guinness from Midland Bank in 1987 as
director of financial control. He was UD's finance director from 1988-1991.
Walter Caldwell, UD's regional director, northern Europe, will succeed him
as md of the international region.
Brian Baldock, 58, will remain chairman of GBW, but in his role as Guinness
deputy chairman is taking on additional responsibilities for the group's
public and strategic affairs, Gleneagles hotel, and Guinness Publishing.
