For the fourth year in a row, the Crazy Horse Steak House in Santa Ana has been named country nightclub of the year by the Academy of Country Music. 
The announcement Wednesday by the Los Angeles-based academy was a prelude to its 25th annual awards ceremony, which NBC will broadcast from the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on April 25. 
Other preliminary awards announced in non-musical categories were country disc jockey of the year, won by Jon Conlon of WGKX in Memphis, and country radio station of the year, won by WSIX in Nashville. 
The Crazy Horse came out on top in a vote by managers, agents and bookers who deal with nightclubs, as well as by record company personnel and other music industry insiders. Fred Reiser, who runs the Crazy Horse, is president of the Academy of Country Music. Reiser also has received honors from the rival Country Music Assn., which is based in Nashville. The CMA named Reiser its promoter of the year for 1988-89. MIKE BOEHM
