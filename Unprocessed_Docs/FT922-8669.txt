There was strong but more selective demand this week, reports the Tea
Brokers' Association. The brightest liquoring East African teas showed
little change in price but good mediums met increased support and were
generally 4 to 6p dearer. Plainer mediums proved irregular but about steady.
Central Africans sold well at dearer rates. Offshore there was very good
demand with better Kenyas sometimes appreciably dearer and Central Africans
showing advances of 3 to 5p. The highest price realised this week was 172p
for a rwanda pf. 1
