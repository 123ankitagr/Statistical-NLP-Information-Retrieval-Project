BRITISH companies underrate the standing in which they are held by Japanese
business customers, according to a survey from Touche Ross, the accountancy
firm, released yesterday.
The survey of 100 companies - which included both Japanese companies and
British firms supplying their Japanese counterparts - showed that all felt
relations had remained stable or improved over the past five years.
Japanese companies said UK suppliers had improved their communication
skills, quality and attention to customers.
The British companies believed improved relations resulted as more Japanese
companies traded in the UK. Mutual understanding was better. UK companies
were often less positive than the Japanese about the UK's competitiveness,
and underestimated the quality, cost and availability of British labour, the
report says.
It suggests that the British sometimes failed to grasp the importance of the
Japanese idea of partnership, which involved a commitment to total customer
satisfaction, including socialising.
The report concludes that UK companies still have a lot to do to improve
communications, quality control and reaction times as suppliers.
