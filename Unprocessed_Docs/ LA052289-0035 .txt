Four motorists who saw a driver attempt to flee after his car struck a bicyclist in Lancaster on Sunday morning forced the man off the road and held him until deputies arrived, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported. 
Perry C. Bingham, 35, of Lancaster was arrested on suspicion of felony hit-and-run and felony drunk driving, Sheriff's Deputy Barbara Critchlow said. 
Bingham was driving erratically on Sierra Highway near Avenue H at about 2:30 a.m. and veered into a bicycle lane, hitting cyclist Carlos Quesada, 28, of Lancaster, Critchlow said. 
Quesada, who suffered cuts to his head, hands and feet, was in fair condition at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical Center, Critchlow said. 
Bingham continued driving after hitting the bicyclist, but motorists in three cars followed his car for about a block and forced it to stop, Critchlow said. The motorists asked Bingham if he knew he had struck the man, and he said yes, Critchlow said. Bingham did not try to flee while the motorists watched him until deputies arrived, she said.
