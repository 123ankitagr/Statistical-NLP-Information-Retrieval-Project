Two local authorities and eight protest groups trying to stop Manchester
Airport building a second runway will use five main lines of argument at a
public inquiry beginning tomorrow. The inquiry is forecast to last until
March 1995 and to cost about Pounds 2m.
Opponents will say the Pounds 160m, 3,050-metre runway should be shelved on
the grounds of green-belt law, environmental protection, operational
unsoundness, air safety hazards and potential danger to public health.
Instead, Manchester will be urged to operate its one runway more efficiently
and transfer charter business and small aircraft to Liverpool and
Leeds-Bradford airports.
Liverpool's expansion plans will face their own public inquiry if they are
called in by Mr John Gummer, the environment secretary. Mr Gummer has said
the Manchester outcome would not then be announced until he was also ready
to pronounce on Liverpool's plans. Macclesfield District Council and
Liverpool City Council will lead the objections to Manchester's plans,
followed by Majag - Manchester Airport Joint Action Group, formed from eight
separate campaigning bodies.
The airport wants to expand to 30m passengers a year by 2005 from its
present size of 13m-plus and rising. It claims 50,000 jobs would be created.
Surveys have shown more than 90 per cent of businesses in north-west England
support the expansion, which some regard as more important economically to
northern England than the Channel tunnel.
To win, Manchester must show it is in the public interest to set aside the
law protecting Cheshire's green belt. The objectors will say Manchester
needs a second runway only because it operates inefficiently by allowing an
uneconomic mix of sizes and types of aircraft, that the proposed runway
configurations will be unsafe because flight paths overlap, and that
increased activity will disturb residents.
