BUSINESSES that make extensive use of private telecommunications networks
will be able to predict their costs with greater confidence following an
agreement between British Telecommunications and the industry regulator
Oftel.
The organisations have agreed to a formula controlling the prices BT will
charge for private circuits for the period 1993 to 1997. It sets a cap on
the rate of inflation on three families or 'baskets' of private circuit -
national analogue circuits, national digital circuits and international
circuits.
The agreement brings to an end a period of controversy over the control of
private circuit prices. Businesses, many of which have extensive and
long-established private analogue circuits, had been concerned about prices
which changed from year to year and made budgeting difficult.
