Chris Greig, who was chief executive of Invergordon Distillers until it was
taken over by Whyte & Mackay, a subsidiary of American Brands, last
November, is returning to the whisky industry. He has become a non-executive
director of William Grant & Sons, the family-owned company which makes
Glenfiddich, the UK's leading single malt.
Greig says it feels good to be back with 'a Scottish independent', William
Grant being one of the last big players in the Scotch whisky industry to fit
that description. 'Being entirely owned by the Grant family allows it to
concentrate on building a long-term, quality business without the
distractions which takeover bids create,' he says.
William Grant only recently decided to appoint non-executive directors.
Earlier this year it brought in Patrick Thomas, managing director of Hermes
in Paris.
The 59-year-old Greig, who led the 1988 management buyout of Invergordon
from Hawker Siddeley and floated it in 1990, has also joined the board of
Robert Wiseman Dairies, the Scottish liquid milk processor and distributor
which is coming to the stock market this month.
