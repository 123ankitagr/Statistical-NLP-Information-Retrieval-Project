City revenues in Oxnard are down $712,000 this year because the city is receiving less money from motor vehicle registration fees, hotel taxes and fines to drunk drivers, according to a quarterly budget review. 
But city officials said the shortfall is such a small percentage of the $59-million city budget that the city will not be forced to make any spending cuts. 
Most of the shortfall will be made up by budget savings over the past nine months. 
Aside from the revenue shortfall, expenditures and revenues are close to their expected targets, said Management and Budget Director Bill Mayer. "It's a good sign," he said. 
The budget review report, which covers July 1, 1989, to March 1, 1990, will be discussed by the City Council today. The city now has $4.2 million in budget reserves. 
Next year's budget outlook, which is set for adoption by the end of June, is less optimistic. City Manager David Mora has warned that if the voters do not adopt a 5% utility users tax on June 5, the city will have to consider $2.7 million in budget cuts. 
Among the cuts being considered are the elimination of police and firefighter positions and the closure of a youth boxing center, a museum, a library and a day camp. HUGO MARTIN
