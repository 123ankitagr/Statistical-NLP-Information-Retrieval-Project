Angela M. Snodgrass, a senior at La Canada High School, placed second Saturday in the Pasadena-area regionals of the Citizen Bee civics competition. 
Snodgrass, one of nearly 300 students competing in regional finals of the nationwide competition, was awarded $300 and qualified to advance to the state finals to be held April 28 at USC. 
The Citizen Bee competition, in its second year in California, is sponsored by the Los Angeles Times and the Close Up Foundation, a Washington-based organization devoted to civic education. The question-and-answer session tests students' knowledge of American government and history, geography, economics, culture and current affairs. 
Winners of the state finals will receive a three-day expense-paid trip to the national finals in Washington.
