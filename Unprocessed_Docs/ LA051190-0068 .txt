The police officer who arrested North Carolina basketball player King Rice on assault charges and resisting arrest exploited the point guard's celebrity status, Coach Dean Smith said. 
"I don't know what his deal is," Smith told the Chapel Hill (N.C.) Newspaper Wednesday. "I hear (the officer) used to follow J.R. (Reid) around, too." Reid is a former North Carolina basketball star playing in the NBA. 
Rice, 21, will appear in District Court May 31 to face charges he assaulted Natalie Nester, his girlfriend, a member of the North Carolina State women's team.
