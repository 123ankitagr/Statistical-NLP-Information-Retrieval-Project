Rescuers cut through the wreckage of a twin-engine commuter plane high up a rugged Costa Rican mountain and retrieved all 23 bodies aboard, including those of five Americans, authorities said. 
The plane crashed about 4,500 feet up 7,450-foot Pico Blanco Mountain, 10 miles southwest of San Jose, five minutes after taking off in a driving rainstorm Monday morning from the capital's airport. The State Department identified three of the Americans as David Ulland of Austin, Minn.; Lester Ross of Lancaster, Pa., and Norman Baltimore of East Smithfield, Pa. It said the families of two other Americans were being notified.
