Will democracy tear Kenya apart? The possibility is advanced by President
Arap Moi who laments that, a mere 28 years after independence, democracy is
being imposed on his country by western aid donors. This, he warns in
Assignment (7.45 BBC2), may lead to tribal warfare.
Amazing, isn't it, how tolerant men are: imagine the bleating that would
ensue from the distaff side if you tried to run a series called 'Women
Behaving Badly', yet here is ITV starting a comedy called Men Behaving Badly
without a word of protest from masculinists. Not so excitable, you see,
emotionally more stable. Murder Squad (9.00 ITV) has so far supplied a
remarkably drab picture of a job which television normally portrays as
vividly dramatic. Perhaps today's case, the first of two parts, will be more
like the conventional television version. Rides is a new six-part drama
about an all-female minicab firm. We are told 'the series is about women
managing their lives'. Golly how advanced: we'll be having a female
sovereign next, or even a female prime minister (9.30 BBC1).
Viewpoint 92 considers the life of Andrei Sakharov 'father of the Soviet
H-bomb' but later greatest of the Russian dissidents.
