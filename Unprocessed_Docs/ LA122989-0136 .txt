James Stewart will be honored for his lifetime contributions as an actor April 23 by the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The tribute at Avery Fisher Hall in New York will include on-stage testimonials from his friends and admirers, and a film created for the event showcasing Stewart's finest moments. 
Stewart, after signing on with MGM in 1932, won acclaim for his performances in the Frank Capra films "You Can't Take It With You," "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" and "It's a Wonderful Life." He won an Oscar for 1940's "The Philadelphia Story" and, after WWII service as a bomber pilot, starred in "Anatomy of a Murder," "Rear Window" and "Harvey."
