Eight professional football players filed suit against the NFL and its teams, charging that the creation of developmental squads amounts to price fixing. 
The suit alleged that the league and its clubs last year illegally agreed to establish a six-person developmental squad for each team and pay those players $1,000 per week over the 16-week season. The suit contends the players could have made much more on injured reserve.
