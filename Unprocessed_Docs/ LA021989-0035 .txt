Yes, President Bush's "Good Start on the Environment" (editorial, Feb. 10) is indeed a welcome change in attitude from the recent past, and it is a relief to know that he is willing to postpone the proposed oil-lease sale off our coast. 
However, it must be recognized that the California coast is anything but a pristine territory; wherein the Wildlife Refuge on the north coast of Alaska is precisely this -- pristine. That the President is ready to degrade Alaska's Wildlife Refuge is evidence that he will abandon environmental progress any time it conflicts with private exploitation of public resources; and this is hardly environmental progress for its own value. 
We need a kinder and a wiser concept of the ecology than the President evinces.
