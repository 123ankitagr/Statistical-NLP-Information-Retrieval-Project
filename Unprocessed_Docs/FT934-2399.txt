Corporate Membership, an investment trust designed to exploit the
introduction of corporate capital to the Lloyd's of London insurance market,
has withdrawn its subscription offer following lack of interest.
The subscription fell substantially short of the 25 per cent required for it
to succeed. Corporate Membership sought Pounds 8m-Pounds 20m to invest in
Lloyd's syndicates but raised less than Pounds 2.5m.
