Replacing a defective gene in colon cancer cells can halt their growth in the test tube, a finding that may point the way to new treatments for America's No. 2 cancer killer, researchers reported in Washington. The new work shows that the gene plays a key role in suppressing cancerous growth in the colon, and possibly elsewhere in the body, said researchers from Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland. Healthy persons usually have two normal gene copies.
