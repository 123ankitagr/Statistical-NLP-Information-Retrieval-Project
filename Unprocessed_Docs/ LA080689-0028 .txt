The graphically violent movie "Batman" instilled in me a sense of evil. I was depressed, not by its content so much as that fact that this hugely popular movie has become such a symbol for both adults and youths. 
Why aren't we making T-shirts, key chains, etc., that praise the virtues of the movie "Field of Dreams" instead? 
Do yourself and your family a favor -- go see "Field of Dreams." And buy your kids a Superman comic book.
