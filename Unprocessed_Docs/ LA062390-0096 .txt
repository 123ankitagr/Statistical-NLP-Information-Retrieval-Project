Russ Nixon was fired as manager of the last-place Atlanta Braves Friday and replaced by the man who gave him the news, General Manager Bobby Cox. 
"I called Russ this morning and told him it was not a good phone call," Cox said. "He knew what I meant. It's upsetting. When somebody fails below you, it's the same as if you failed." 
Cox said Nixon, under pressure since the Braves lost 13 of their first 15 games and 40 of their first 65, took the news calmly, adding: "He said he felt tremendous relief that it was all over. He had been under a lot of pressure the last few days." 
Nixon said, from his home in Covington, Ga.: "I've been expecting it. It's been evident the last two weeks. One of the bullets was going to get me, they've been shooting so many at me." 
This is Cox's second stint as manager of the Braves in less than 10 years. Stan Kasten, the club president, said Cox will keep both jobs the rest of the year and then give up one of them. 
Cox, in his fifth season as general manager, managed the Braves for four seasons in 1978-81 and managed the Toronto Blue Jays for four seasons in 1982-85. 
Nixon was named manager of the Braves in 1988 after Chuck Tanner was fired. The club was 42-79 under his direction that year and 63-97 in 1989, finishing in last place both times. He also managed Cincinnati in 1982 and '83, when the Reds finished last both seasons. 
Nixon is the third manager fired this season, following Davey Johnson of the New York Mets and Bucky Dent of the New York Yankees. 
Kasten also said pitching coach Bruce Dal Canton will be replaced by Leo Mazzone, pitching coach with Atlanta's International League farm club at Richmond, Va. Dal Canton will replace Mazzone at Richmond.
