Charles W. Colson, the Watergate conspirator who founded a prison ministry, will visit Brea on Monday to tour a home that prisoners are refurbishing as part of a rehabilitation program. 
Colson, a special counsel to former President Richard M. Nixon who was known as his hatchet man, served seven months in prison for obstruction of justice. 
He became a born-again Christian and has since convinced even former skeptics of his sincerity. 
His visit to Orange County coincides with weeklong festivities leading up to Friday's opening of the Richard M. Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
Colson will be visiting a home on East Fir Street that is being cleaned and refurbished by 10 inmates on furlough from Boron Federal Prison Camp and Lompoc Federal Prison. 
The program is sponsored by Prison Fellowship Ministries' Community Service Project, which Colson launched in 1982. It aims to help inmates restore their self-respect and repay society by working on projects that aid the needy. 
The East Fir Street house belongs to a couple in their 80s. The husband is living in a convalescent hospital until the house is remodeled.
