After breaking a 7-game losing streak last week, Cal State Fullerton will try to win its third game in a row when it plays the University of the Pacific at 5 p.m. today in the Spanos Center. 
Pacific has lost 4 in a row, but forced UC Santa Barbara to overtime last week. 
Fullerton's Cedric Ceballos is coming off a week in which he scored 84 points and had 40 rebounds in 3 games. He is averaging 21 points and 9 rebounds a game for the Titans, who are 7-8, 2-4 in conference. 
Pacific is coming off a 69-52 loss to Fresno State Thursday. Daryl Wolfe, a junior forward, led the Tigers with 14 points in that game. Pacific is 5-11, 1-7 in conference play. 
Proceeds of game program sales will be donated to a trust fund for victims of the recent shooting massacre at Cleveland Elementary School here. Prime Ticket, which will televise the game live, will advise viewers where donations may be sent. ROBYN NORWOOD
