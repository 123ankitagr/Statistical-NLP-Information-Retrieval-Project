The NFL players union today suggested that all members of the news media, male and female, be barred from locker rooms and that separate interview areas be set up to assure privacy for the players. 
"NFL players should be afforded absolute privacy in their locker rooms," Gene Upshaw, executive director of the NFL Players Assn., said in a statement from his union's headquarters. 
"They should not be expected or required to participate in media interviews unless fully clothed." 
His statement follows two recent incidents involving female sports writers covering NFL teams. 
Boston Herald reporter Lisa Olson alleged that on Sept. 17 several Patriot players approached her while they were naked in an attempt to embarrass her with lewd suggestions. 
Cincinnati Bengals Coach Sam Wyche barred USA Today's Denise Tom from entering his team's locker room last Monday. Wyche was fined 1/17th of his salary by the league. 
Upshaw acknowledged that women reporters must have the same access to players as male reporters. As a possible solution, he suggested a "separate area, removed from the locker room, where all players would be available on an equal basis to all accredited media, male or female."
