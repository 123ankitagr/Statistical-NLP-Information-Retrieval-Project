1. How much will your children's education cost? When will you need to pay
out? How much you should put away now each month?
2. Are you making the most of your children's tax allowances?
3. Is it worth considering re-mortgaging? Should you look at a fixed-rate
deal?
4. Do you have enough insurance? Check your cover for life insurance,
permanent health insurance (sick pay insurance which pays for extended
periods off work due to illness), private medical insurance, critical
illness insurance (a sort of life insurance which pays out before you die if
you become seriously ill), and long-term care insurance (to pay for nursing
homes).
5. Are you paying enough into your pension plan? If you are in an employer's
scheme, should you be making extra payments to an additional voluntary
contribution plan?
6. How much cash do you have on deposit? Should you shift more of it into
higher-risk/higher-return equity-based investments?
7. Do you have the right mix of income and growth investments?
8. Is your portfolio balanced properly to reflect the risk you want to take?
9. Are your affairs organised in the most tax-efficient way?
10. Have you updated your will to make clear who should inherit your wealth
after you die? Is there scope for making gifts while alive? Have you
arranged things to keep the taxman's take to a minimum?
