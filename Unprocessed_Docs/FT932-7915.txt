TRAFFIC through Britain's ports was virtually unchanged at 495m tonnes last
year, with foreign traffic up 2 per cent and domestic traffic down 4 per
cent, the Department of Transport said yesterday.
London - comprising Tilbury and the Thames riverside wharves - remained the
leading port, handling 49m tonnes.
