It seems clear to me that once CNN reporter Gloria Hillard's material hits the network, it's no longer personal property. 
Since CNN allows its affiliates to use material from the network without restriction, no ethical boundary has been crossed. It is not plagiarism to use somebody's material with his or her full consent. 
Hillard's indignation is something that should be worked out privately with her employer.
