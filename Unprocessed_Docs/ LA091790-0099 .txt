Fox's smash hit "The Simpsons" was named best animated program of the 1989-90 TV season during Saturday's portion of the 42nd annual Emmy Awards, which covered 44 categories among nighttime programs. 
"The Simpsons," not eligible under current rules of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences to be entered in the outstanding comedy series category, won out over nominees "Garfield's Feline Fantasies," "Garfield's Thanksgiving," "Why, Charlie Brown, Why?" and its own "The Simpsons Christmas Special," all single-episode shows. 
Other winners during Saturday's banquet ceremony, which mostly focused on craft and technical categories, included ABC's "Twin Peaks," which picked up Emmys for editing and costume design. NBC's miniseries "The Phantom of the Opera" also won awards in two categories, while HBO's "Carmen on Ice" and Fox's now-defunct "The Tracey Ullman Show" each won three. 
The ceremony, hosted by actor-comedian Paul Reiser from the Pasadena Civic Exhibition Hall, will be broadcast Tuesday at 8 p.m. on KTTV Channel 11 -- the first time the technical awards have been televised.
