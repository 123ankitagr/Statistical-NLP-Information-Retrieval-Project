Sir, British Aerospace may well be crowing at the sale of Rover to BMW.
Corporate Britain, however, should be far more apprehensive.
Corporate Japan views its long-term corporate partnership arrangements very,
very seriously and Honda has surely honoured its part in the resuscitation
of Rover from a basket-case to where it stands today.
It may therefore be a long time before any other corporate giant in Japan
signs a similar, so-called long-term partnership agreement with any other
flagship of British industry.
