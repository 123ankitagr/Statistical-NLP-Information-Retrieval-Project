Next month's summit at sea between President Bush and Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev will take place on U.S. and Soviet warships in waters off Malta, the White House announced today. 
The site designation was said by White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater to have been made "in accordance with an agreement with Maltese authorities." 
Original speculation about the summit site had centered on the waters off Italy, since Gorbachev will conclude a visit there on Dec. 1. However, Fitzwater issued a midday announcement pinpointing the waters off Malta as the site. 
Malta is an independent republic in the central Mediterranean consisting of five islands, two of them uninhabited. It lies 58 miles south of Sicily, 220 miles north of Libya and 180 miles east of Tunisia.
