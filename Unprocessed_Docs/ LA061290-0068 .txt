The sixth day of jury selection in the drug and perjury trial of Mayor Marion Barry ended with Barry ducking rumors of an imminent announcement about his political future and denying there was any plea bargaining. 
"There's no plea bargaining going on, there never has been," Barry told reporters. Asked about his political plans, Barry said: "There will be a press conference when I have something to say -- next week, next month." The Washington Times and local TV station WRC reported that sources said Barry would withdraw from the race Monday evening.
