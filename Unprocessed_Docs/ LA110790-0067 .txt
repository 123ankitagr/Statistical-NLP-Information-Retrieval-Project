A businessman charged with kidnaping the daughter of a family friend and holding her for a $400,000 ransom is scheduled to go on trial Jan. 2. 
J. C. Aler, 56, of San Diego is accused of abducting Sarah Zien, 26, daughter of Jim Zien, a former executive with McDonald's Corp., on Sept. 11 and holding her for 28 hours until she escaped. 
Aler pleaded not guilty Tuesday, and San Diego Superior Court Judge Jesus Rodriguez set the trial date. 
No ransom was paid and the victim escaped in an El Cajon drug store after the kidnaper escorted her inside to have a prescription filled. 
Aler remains in County Jail without bail.
