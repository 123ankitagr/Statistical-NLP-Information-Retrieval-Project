Five people flying from Modesto to San Diego were injured when their single-engine Beechcraft airplane lost power about 11 a.m. and crashed near Gorman, authorities said. 
The pilot, Ray Glover, 39, of the Madera County town of Ahwahnee, made an emergency landing in rugged terrain near Quail Lake, about one mile north of California 138 and two miles east of Interstate 5, said Lt. Ed Chenal of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita. The plane was destroyed. 
Glover walked about a mile from the crash site to a telephone and summoned help, Chenal said. The pilot and his passengers -- his wife, Anna Glover, 37; their son, Travis Glover, 2; the pilot's sister-in-law Lynn Kelly, 34, and her daughter, Kristin, 2, both of Miami -- were taken by helicopter and ambulance to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. 
Hospital spokeswoman Susan Mandy said all suffered minor injuries. She would not say whether they were being admitted. 
The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.
