Glendale will build a $1.5-million pipeline to move water from the Los Angeles-Glendale water reclamation plant on the east bank of the Los Angeles River to Forest Lawn cemetery two miles away. 
Under the agreement approved by the Glendale City Council, Forest Lawn will receive up to 200 million gallons of reclaimed water each year to landscaped the cemetery's 125 acres of lawns. Forest Lawn will pay for the treated sewage water at a rate of 75% of the cost of drinking water. DAVID M. KINCHENFrom staff reports
