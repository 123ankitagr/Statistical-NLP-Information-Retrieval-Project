NLRB Rules in Favor of Pacific Lumber: Pacific Lumber Co., which has faced numerous legal and environmental challenges since it was bought by Maxxam Inc. in 1985, has won a key ruling against a group of workers trying to organize a buyout of the company. The National Labor Relations Board determined that federal labor laws do not protect employees who engage in activity to overthrow a company's management. Two employees of Pacific Lumber asked the NLRB to issue an unfair labor complaint against Pacific Lumber, which they said had punished them for trying to organize an employee stock ownership plan to buy the company from Maxxam and its chief executive, Charles Hurwitz.
