The United States is speeding up $48.1 million in military aid to help the government fight guerrillas who have acquired sophisticated, Soviet-made missiles and used them to shoot down two Salvadoran warplanes, the State Department said. Administration officials said a spent canister from a Soviet-made A-14 surface-to-air missile has been found near the area where one of the aircraft was destroyed. The previously budgeted aid will allow the government to replace aircraft and equipment damaged or destroyed in the attacks, which began Nov. 20.
