San Diego Opera announced that Carroll Freeman will replace ailing tenor Mark DuBois in the role of Ernesto in Donizetti's "Don Pasquale," which continues Friday and Sunday at Civic Theatre. Although this marks Freeman's San Diego Opera debut, he performed with the San Diego Symphony as soloist in three performances of Handel's "Messiah" in December. The young American tenor made his New York City Opera debut in Verdi's "La Traviata" and has sung frequently with Houston Grand Opera.
