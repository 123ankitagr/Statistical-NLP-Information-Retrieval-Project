PEUGEOT TALBOT, the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French car
maker, suffered an 80 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year to Pounds
10.2m.
The fall from Pounds 50.8m in 1991 came despite turnover increased to Pounds
1.53bn (Pounds 1.44bn).
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director, warned yesterday that trading
conditions would remain difficult and margins would continue to be
'depressed' in 1993.
Peugeot Talbot's pre-tax profits have dropped steeply during the prolonged
UK recession from Pounds 135m in 1989 and Pounds 109m in 1990.
After-tax profits fell last year by 82 per cent to Pounds 6.8m, from Pounds
36.3m in 1991.
The company is being forced to halt production for three days this week from
Wednesday to Friday at its Ryton, Coventry assembly plant in the face of
weak sales in particular in export markets. About 3,500 hourly paid
production workers will be laid off with the loss of 5 shifts.
The announcement of the sharp deterioration in the company's profitability
was accelerated in the face of the continuing threat of industrial action at
the Ryton plant.
The workforce is due to ballot again on Monday about a two-year pay deal,
after abandoning a previous strike threat last Friday.
Peugeot Talbot car exports from the UK dropped last year by 13.6 per cent,
from 61,384 to 53,019, reflecting lower demand in some continental European
markets, said Mr Whalen.
In the UK, the Peugeot marque increased its market share to 7.8 per cent
(7.3 per cent) helped by a 7.3 per cent jump in sales volume to 124,019
(115,557).
Mr Whalen said that profit margins had been squeezed by difficult market
conditions both in the UK and in continental Europe, by the impact of the
devaluation of the pound, and by increasing demands to meet tougher
environmental requirements and higher vehicle safety and security standards.
Car output at the Ryton assembly plant fell by 2.5 per cent last year to
85,728, against 87,965 in 1991. The company started production last month of
a second car range at Ryton, the Peugeot 306, which will be launched in the
UK in April.
