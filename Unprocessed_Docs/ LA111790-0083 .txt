In a rematch of last year's final, Corona del Mar High School will meet Mira Costa in the Southern Section 5-A girls' volleyball championship match tonight at Cerritos College. 
The top-seeded Sea Kings (23-1) have a 21-match winning streak and are ranked fourth nationally by Volleyball Monthly magazine. 
Corona del Mar hasn't won a section title in girls' volleyball since 1978. 
Sixth-seeded Mira Costa (20-1) advanced to the final with a five-game victory over El Toro in the semifinals. Mira Costa defeated Corona del Mar in last year's final. 
The Sea Kings are led by senior middle blocker Lara Carlsen and senior outside hitter Tracy Schriber. 
The Division 3-A final will feature the only undefeated teams in Orange County -- top-seeded La Habra (18-0) and third-seeded El Modena (18-0). The match will start at 3:30 p.m., also at Cerritos College. MIKE REILLEY
