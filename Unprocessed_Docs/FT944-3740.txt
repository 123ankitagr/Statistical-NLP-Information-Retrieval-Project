It is time to start thinking about that crucial soundtrack to the Christmas
dinner; and thanks to the extraordinary commercial success of religious
music over the last 12 months, record companies have provided us with a
bewildering choice.
For those who helped put Gregorian chants at the top of the classical charts
for much of the year, Eternal Peace: Gregorian Chant for Christmas (Deutsche
Grammophon) provides a timely seasonal top-up of spiritual sustenance. The
choir of the monks of Montserrat Abbey sing the 12 Responsories of Matins at
Christmas, while the First Mass for Christmas is performed by the
Benedictine Abbey at Munsterschwarzach.
Christmas with the Academy (Decca) is more of a mixed bag: Sir Neville
Marriner conducts the Academy of St Martin in the Fields in a performance of
popular classics such as 'Ding Dong] Merrily on High' and 'Hark the Herald
Angels Sing'. More adventurous is Carols from the Old and New Worlds
(Harmonia Mundi), in which Paul Hillier and the Theatre of Voices superbly
rattle through a host of unfamiliar arrangements of much-loved tunes.
On the splendidly-priced Naxos label, Jeremy Summerly directs the Oxford
Camerata in Medieval Carols, a collection which includes 'Ave Maria',
'Gaudete Christus est Natus' and Hildegard of Bingen's haunting monophonic
'O Viridissima Virga'. The historical archive label Nimbus joins in the fun
with The Spirit of Christmas Past; highlights include Caruso singing
'Cantique de Noel' and the awesome Ernestine Schumann-Heink's 'Stille
Nacht'.
For those who find it inconceivable to think of a Christmas without the
likes of Slade (above) and Gary Glitter, The Best Christmas ..Ever (Virgin)
runs through 42 pop classics (including the pleasant surprise of Miles
Davis's 'Blue Christmas'). Older generations in search of easy listening for
a difficult day will prefer, on the same label, Yule Cool featuring Perry
Como, Dean Martin and Nat King Cole.
