Hollywood's Robin Hood Derby took a new turn Monday when 20th Century Fox announced plans to make "The Adventures of Robin Hood" as a three-hour made-for-TV movie instead of a feature film. 
The studio suspended the project when it was learned that Morgan Creek Productions had signed Kevin Costner to "Prince of Thieves," a $40-million Robin Hood saga to be distributed sometime next year by Warner Bros. 
Fox's TV movie, which is likely to air here before "Prince of Thieves" is released, will be distributed theatrically abroad.
