A 21-year-old Newport Beach woman died after hitting her head in a fall from her bicycle Sunday, Costa Mesa police said. 
The woman, whose identify was withheld pending notification of relatives, was riding north on Harbor Boulevard near Merrimac Way in Costa Mesa when she apparently lost her balance, fell off her bike and hit her head on the wheel of a nearby car, Costa Mesa Lt. Sam Cordeiro said.

The driver of the passing car, George W. Whited of Huntington Beach, was not cited, Cordeiro said.
