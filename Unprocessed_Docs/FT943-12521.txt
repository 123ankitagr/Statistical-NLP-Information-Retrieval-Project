Road traffic between Hungary and Austria came to a virtual standstill on
Saturday as Hungarian border guards stepped up passport and customs checks
following a bomb blast in Budapest.
Austrian customs officials said Hungarian border guards were checking the
documents and belongings of every person, regardless of nationality, leaving
and entering the country.
This was creating kilometre-long traffic jams on both sides of the border.
