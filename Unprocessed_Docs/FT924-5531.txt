The Essential History Of Europe began last week with an amusing attempt by
Dario Fo to say what it means to be an Italian. Today journalist Julia
Sevillano traverses Spain to show how different her country is from its
well-worn image (8.00 BBC2).
BBC1's natural history series Living Dangerously is concerned with 'The
Warthog And The Teabag', a juxtaposition - wild animal and industrialised
product from cultivated crop - which serves to raise the question of how
mankind uses or misuses natural resources (8.00 BBC1).
In the opening episode of Sitting Pretty (8.30 BBC1) John Sullivan seemed to
have written his rich former working class heroine into something of a
corner by depriving her of all her money in the last few minutes. Either
this will turn out to be untrue, or we are to have a nouveau riche heroine
who is suddenly vielle pauvre.
So far Absolutely Fabulous has been making me laugh much more. Jennifer
Saunders' dreadful latterday hippy and her square and boring daughter are
good, but Joanna Lumley's squiffy Sloane Ranger is wonderful (8.30 BBC1).
