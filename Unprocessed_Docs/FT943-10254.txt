Codelco, Chile's state copper company, is to ask UK and US regulatory
authorities to investigate a 'series of unusual operations' said to have
been conducted with brokers on the London and New York metals exchanges last
year. It said it might take legal action against the brokers concerned.
Codelco, the world's largest copper producer, lost up to Dollars 270m
(Pounds 174.1m) between September 1993 and January of this year when its
chief metals futures operator, Mr Juan Pablo Davila, went on a disastrous
trading spree. He is believed to have dealt with more than 20 London and New
York brokers.
