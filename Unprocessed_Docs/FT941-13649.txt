The community charge grant scheme will be extended into 1995-96, Mr David
Curry, local government minister, announced yesterday. The grant offsets
local authorities' loss of income following the Pounds 140 general reduction
in poll tax for 1991-92.
Mr Curry said extension of the scheme would enable local authorities to
receive compensation for arrears collected during the period. There would be
no further extension.
