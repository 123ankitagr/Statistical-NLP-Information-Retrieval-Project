Dave Justice, who began the season in the minor leagues, was voted National League rookie of the year after hitting 28 home runs for the Atlanta Braves. 
Justice, 24, got most of his homers after he took over in right field when Dale Murphy was traded in early August. Justice batted .282 in 127 games, with 78 runs batted in.
