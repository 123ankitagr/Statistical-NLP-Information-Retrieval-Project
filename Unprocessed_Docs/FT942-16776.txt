Magnets have come a long way from the school physics laboratory. Thorn
Automation, of Rugeley, Staffordshire, has developed a portable traffic
analyser which uses magnets to detect the type of vehicle travelling along
the road.
The EdgeHog incorporates a magnet in a box secured to a post up to 1.5
metres from the road edge. As vehicles pass, the magnetic field they produce
is measured by the EdgeHog, enabling it to determine the difference between
cars, van and lorries - the main aim of many traffic censuses. By placing
two EdgeHogs two metres apart the speed of the vehicles can also be
measured.

Magnets are also coming to the aid of companies with drinks vending
machines. The machines often get clogged up with deposits of scale,
particularly in hard water areas.
Water Technics, of Woking, Surrey, has adapted magnetic technology already
used in the processing industry to help keep vending machines in operation.
To prevent the scaling the water passes through the magnetic field created
by strategically-placed magnets. The magnetic forces prevent the calcium and
magnesium crystals sticking to each other and so being deposited.
