South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday played down reports that
North Korea had probably developed nuclear bombs, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'North Korea has strong intentions to develop nuclear weapons. But (I)
cannot say North Korea possesses any nuclear arms at the moment,' Yonhap
news agency quoted Mr Kim as saying. 'We have accurate information about
that.'
On Sunday, the New York Times said the US Central Intelligence Agency had
advised President Bill Clinton that North Korea had probably built one or
two nuclear bombs. The newspaper, quoting unnamed US officials, said the
finding was disputed by the State Department but supported by all
intelligence agencies.
In Tokyo yesterday, the foreign minister, Mr Tsutomu Hata, said Japan would
not impose economic sanctions against North Korea over its suspected nuclear
weapons programme. He did not specify whether he was ruling out unilateral
sanctions or whether Japan would refuse to join any UN-ordered embargo
against North Korea.
