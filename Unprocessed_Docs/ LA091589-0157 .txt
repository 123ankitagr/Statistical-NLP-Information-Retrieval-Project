The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team, administered by the county Health Care Agency division of environmental health, responds to calls on chemical spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials. Sometimes it goes to the site, other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the phone. 
Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County (departments, plus the county), three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim, Huntington Beach and the county station in Irvine. Hazmat is called in most, but not all, incidents. Following is Hazmat's spill response log for July.
