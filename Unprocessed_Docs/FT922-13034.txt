THE BOMB attack on Staples Corner, one of Britain's busiest road junctions,
marks a new phase in the IRA's campaign against the capital's transport
system, Richard Tomkins writes.
Earlier attacks have involved relatively small devices on London Underground
or at main British Rail stations.
Attacking a key element of the trunk-road network disrupts the journeys of a
wider cross-section of the public, including many business and industrial
road users. The sheer size of the explosion means disruption not just for
days but for weeks and possibly months.
The explosion took place at the point where the M1 motorway and A5 trunk
road, two of the main traffic arteries to the north, disgorge their traffic
into the London road system.
