The Czech government yesterday cleared the way for Volkswagen to increase
its stake in Skoda Automobilova by approving a controversial amendment to a
1991 agreement. The amendment allows Volkswagen to take its stake in Skoda
from 31 per cent to 60.3 per cent by the end of this year and to 70 per cent
by the end of 1995, for a total cost of DM1.4bn. But the new agreement also
accepts a substantial cut in Volkswagen's overall investment from an
anticipated DM9.5bn (Pounds 3.87bn) when the original contract was signed,
to Dm3.7bn. In return, Volkswagen has agreed to expand Skoda's production
capacity to 340,000 cars a year by 2000 from 230,000 currently and to
introduce a new family-type car based on a Volkswagen design.
