The international credit rating agencies are underrating the quality of
Argentina's debt, Mr Domingo Cavallo, the country's economy minister, told a
conference in London yesterday.
'The rating for Argentinian bonds is very low compared to what it should
be,' he said. 'We have double-B-minus, the same as Venezuela, and Mexico has
double-B-plus. But if you look at the economic fundamentals and prospects,
Argentina is not different from Mexico. We should have double-B-plus,' he
said.
The bond market 'gives Argentina more or less the same rating as Mexico,' he
said, illustrated by the fact that Argentinian and Mexican yield spreads
over US bonds are very similar, and much tighter than Venezuelan yield
spreads.
All three countries have sub-investment grade ratings, although Mexico's
rating has long been expected to be raised to investment grade. However,
that has been delayed by political uncertainty.
