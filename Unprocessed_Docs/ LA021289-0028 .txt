Even though rapper and ex-gang member Tone Loc lectures at schools, I find it hard to believe anyone would consider him a role model to ghetto youngsters ("Tone Loc: A 'Wild Thing' in the World of Rap," Jan. 29). 
Dennis Hunt quotes him as saying, "For the right money, I'd play a Ku Klux Klan rally." Tone exhibits a common social disorder known as greed. I doubt he has ever been serious about anything, including gang membership.
