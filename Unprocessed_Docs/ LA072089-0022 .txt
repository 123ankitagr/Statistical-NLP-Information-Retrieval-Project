The Avalon City Council passed a resolution on drug and alcohol policy Tuesday by a 4-1 vote. Mayor Hugh T. (Bud) Smith was absent. 
The policy, approved by city employee groups and city officials before the meeting, prohibits the sale or use of drugs and alcohol on city property. It also requires drug testing of prospective employees. Employees who are involved in an accident or are suspected of abusing drugs also would be asked to take the test. Those who refuse would be ineligible for drug rehabilitation benefits and could face suspension. 
City Manager Chuck Prince said the policy was required by the federal Drug Free Workplace Act of 1988, which mandates the development of drug and alcohol policies by local agencies receiving federal funds.
