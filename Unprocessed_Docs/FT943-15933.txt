Human rights workers around the world are falling victim to the kind of
torture, ill-treatment and other violations they are trying to prevent, the
human rights group Amnesty International says today, in its annual report
for 1993, Reuter reports from London.
Police beatings, arrests and executions without trial and mass killings have
been reported, despite a climate that increasingly highlights the importance
of human rights, the report says.
'Human rights defenders often became the first victims of governments trying
to build a good human rights image abroad and fearful of the damage human
rights activists can do to that image.'
The report, covering 151 countries, found that prisoners of conscience were
held in 63 countries, more than 100,000 political prisoners were held
without charge or trial in 53, more than 112 governments tortured or
ill-treated prisoners, and political killings by the state took place in 61
nations. Some 2,000 people were executed in 32 countries last year.
'We are also trying to draw attention to the fact that these things are not
inevitable. . . they are not flukes,' Mr Derek Evans, head of Amnesty's Asia
and Pacific research division, said. 'They are implemented as policy by
governments.'
