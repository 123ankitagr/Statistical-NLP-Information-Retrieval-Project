Japan's Matsushita Electric and Philips Electronics of the Netherlands plan
to break into the market for personal cassette players with the first
portable players for digital compact cassette, the new music format.
An estimated 75 per cent of the 200m analogue cassette players sold today
are portable.
Matsushita will sell the unit in Japan from June at Y60,000 (Pounds 350)
each, followed by a US launch. Philips plans a similar launch date.
Matsushita: Japan, 06 908 1121. Philips: Netherlands, 40 736 106.
