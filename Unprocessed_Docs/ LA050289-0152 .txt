The Philadelphia Eagles have offered Reggie White a contract that would make him the highest paid defensive player in the game, according to club President Harry T. Gamble. 
Gamble said Monday that club officials probably will meet in the next two days with White, considered by many the best defensive player in the NFL. 
"(The offer) doesn't necessarily mean we will bring this thing to fruition," Gamble said. 
Bruce Smith of the Buffalo Bills signed the highest contract for a defensive player to date in March: $1.7 million a year. White received $400,000 last year. He was not at home Monday night to comment on Gamble's offer. 
White steadfastly has maintained that unless he gets a new contract that makes him the highest paid defensive player in the NFL, he will sit out the season. Before Gamble's announcement, White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said White will miss the mini-camp that begins today.
