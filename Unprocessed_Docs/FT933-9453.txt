A quarter of a million small firms which lease or rent business premises are
locked into upward-only rent agreements, according to the latest
NatWest/Small Business Research Trust survey*.
Of these, half have three or more years remaining on their lease before they
can surrender it or leave without sub-letting. As interest rates, inflation
and rents come down small businesses trapped in agreements which do not
permit reductions in rent levels are at a big disadvantage, NatWest said.
Rent accounts for an average 5.5 per cent of the sales of small businesses
while business rates account for a further 2.3 per
cent.
