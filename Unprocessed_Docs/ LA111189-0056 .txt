Howard Rollins, co-star of the NBC police series "In the Heat of the Night," was released from an Atlanta hospital Friday after passing a stress test for chest pains he suffered on the set of the show, MGM/UA Television announced. 
The studio released a statement from Crawford Long Hospital saying that there was no evidence of coronary artery blockage. Rollins, 37, who stars in the series with Carroll O'Connor, earlier passed EKG and heart blood tests for the pains that caused him to be hospitalized Tuesday. 
MGM/UA spokesman Kim Reed said Rollins was expected to return soon to the show.
