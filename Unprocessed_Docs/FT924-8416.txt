Sir, I refer to Dominic Lawson's article, 'Conservatives sell their
birthright' (November 7), concerning the Leasehold Enfranchisement Act. I am
surprised someone with his background should be taking the side of the
feudal landlords, unless it has something to do with social climbing.
Most likely there is no country left in Europe where this archaic system is
still in existence. I assume that the vast tracts of land still owned by a
few families were either appropriated or gifted by some long since
discredited king or ruler. This system of handing down ancestral
acquisitions is hardly equitable in these days where nothing else is handed
down.
