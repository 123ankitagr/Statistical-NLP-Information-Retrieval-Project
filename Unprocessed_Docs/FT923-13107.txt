A SCOTTISH Office minister is to visit Taiwan in September to try to
persuade Taiwanese companies to bring inward investment projects to
Scotland, writes James Buxton.
Mr Allan Stewart, Scottish industry minister, will be the first minister
from a UK territorial ministry to visit Taiwan.
Mr Stewart's visit is being described as a private visit in response to a
Taiwanese invitation.
This procedure is used to avoid offending China and because the UK has no
diplomatic relations with Taiwan.
No Taiwanese investments have yet been established in Scotland.
In November 1990, Delta Electronics, a manufacturer of power supply
equipment for electronic products, announced it was set up a plant at
Inchinnan near Glasgow which could eventually employ 570 people. However,
the project was subsequently frozen and is thought unlikely to be revived.
Mr Stewart, who is spending five days in Taiwan, said he did not expect his
visit would lead to immediate announcements of new projects.
