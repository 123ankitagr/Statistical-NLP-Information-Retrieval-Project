President Zine Abidine ben Ali announced Saturday that he will seek election in April in Tunisia's first presidential balloting in 15 years. 
Ben Ali, 52, took power in November, 1987, ousting Habib Bourguiba, who had ruled for three decades. 
The presidential elections, the first since 1974, are expected to take place April 2 and will be the first public test of Ben Ali's popularity.
