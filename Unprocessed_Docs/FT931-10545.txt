THE pension age for women should be raised to 65 and the common retirement
age raised eventually to 67, the Social Market Foundation, an independent
think tank, argues in a report published today
It was written by Mr David Willetts, Conservative MP for Havant and a member
of the Commons social security committee. He rejects the idea that there is
a demographic crisis caused by an increasing number of old people. He argues
instead that many people stop working too soon.
