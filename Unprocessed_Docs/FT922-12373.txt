Taiwan's Finance Ministry published regulations governing the issue of
global depository receipts (GDRs) by Taiwanese companies yesterday, paving
the way for China Steel's Dollars 360m (Pounds 203m) international share
offering to be made by July this year, writes Luisetta Mudie in Taipei.
The use of GDRs is the first by a Taiwanese company, and constitutes the
next stage in the privatisation of China Steel, which is 88 per cent
government-owned. Fifteen per cent of China Steel's shares will be floated.
