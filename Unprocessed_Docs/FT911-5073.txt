ALL TEN local authorities that have shares in Manchester airport have the
legal power to make loans to the airport, the High Court ruled yesterday.
Mr Justice Kennedy refused an application from Manchester City Council,
which has 55 per cent of the airport, for a declaration that it alone could
make loans to the airport company, while nine district councils, which have
5 per cent each, could not.
