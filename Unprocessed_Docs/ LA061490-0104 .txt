Chinese Army Buys AT&T Equipment: American Telephone & Telegraph Co. is selling $5 million worth of high-technology phone equipment to the Chinese army and has launched a joint venture to make equipment in the Communist nation, the company said. The contract -- for digital telephone exchanges -- with the People's Liberation Army was signed last month and is awaiting U.S. government approval, said AT&T spokesman Tom Harris. Harris also said AT&T was granted a license by the Chinese government about two months ago to start a joint-venture to make telecommunication transmission equipment.
