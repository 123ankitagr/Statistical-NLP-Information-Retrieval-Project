The City Council has allocated $9,500 to complete a survey that identifies historical buildings in San Dimas. 
The council, on a 4-1 vote Tuesday, approved the funding. Councilman Curt Morris dissented. 
The money is in addition to the $27,000 the city approved last year for the project, said Larry Stevens, director of community development. It will be used to pay consultants to compile and organize data on the old buildings.
