SISTEM TRANSIT ALIRAN RINGAN (STAR), has raised Pounds 300m of funding for
work on Phase One of the project to develop a light rail transit system
(LRT) for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur.
Over 18 months ago, the Anglo-German consortium of Taylor Woodrow
International and AEG Westinghouse Transport Systeme GmbH formed STAR to
raise private investment capital for the first phase of the LRT project.
Having secured capital, STAR would then own and operate the system under a
franchise agreement with the Malaysian government.
STAR now has in place the required funds to begin work on the project. Over
60 per cent is sourced from commercial bank loans, around 10 per cent from a
government support loan and the balance in the form of equity from Malaysian
and foreign investors.
This project represents the first phase of an integrated light rail network
for Kuala Lumpur and surrounding areas.
Taylor Woodrow International and AEG Westinghouse Transport Systeme GmbH,
together form the Kuala Lumpur Transit Group Sdn Bhd (KLTG), which has
entered into a Pounds 225m contract with STAR to undertake the design,
construction, delivery, installation and testing of the LRT system.
