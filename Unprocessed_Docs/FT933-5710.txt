EASTMAN KODAK, the US film company, has filed an anti-dumping petition
against Japanese photo product makers for allegedly selling colour
photographic paper in the US at prices below those in their domestic market.
Kodak said that Japanese manufacturers of these products were selling paper
for colour prints at dumping margins of up to 300 per cent. The company
condemned the Japanese action as 'an illegal trade practice'.
The companies cited include Fuji Photo Film and its Dutch subsidiary,
Konica, Oriental Photo Industrial and Mitsubishi Paper Mills.
Japanese photographic product makers have been expanding in the US, which
has become their second largest market in the world after Japan. While Fuji
has taken about 10 per cent of the US market for colour film, it has about
50 per cent of the Japanese market. Kodak, which has been in the Japanese
market for over a decade, has often complained that the Japanese film market
is dominated by Japanese makers and closed to outsiders.
Fuji said yesterday that since it had not received a copy of the petition
yet it did not know what prices Kodak was referring to in its claim of
dumping by the Japanese company. Colour negative photographic paper is sold
to wholesalers and labs, which charge for the prints that are made with the
photographic paper.
Konica said that it was not exporting photographic paper to the US any more
since it had a manufacturing plant there which met demand for the North
American market.
Kodak's charge follows claims of dumping against Japanese steelmakers
recently, claims against carmakers earlier this year which did not lead to
formal charges, as well as a formal anti-dumping petition against
Japanese-made defrosters in February and against steel products in May.
