President Bush said today he will nominate Glen A. Holden, a Los Angeles insurance executive, to be ambassador to Jamaica. 
Holden has been the head of the Holden Group in Los Angeles since 1973. He would succeed Michael Sotirhos. 
Bush also said he has chosen Lannon Walker, a career Foreign Service office and one-time ambassador to Senegal, to be ambassador to Nigeria. He would succeed Princeton Nathan Lyman. 
The nominations, which require Senate confirmation, were announced here at the end of Bush's 10-day European trip.
