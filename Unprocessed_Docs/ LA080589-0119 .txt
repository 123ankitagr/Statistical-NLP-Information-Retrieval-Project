Park Chul Un, South Korea's first state minister for political affairs, on Friday disputed a network report that he secretly visited North Korea twice during June. 
"There is nothing to the report," Park told reporters when asked to comment on a news report by Munhwa Broadcasting Corp. Television. "Somebody is inventing and propagating the story." 
Munhwa said in its main evening newscast Thursday that Park first visited North Korea around June 4 accompanied by a fellow legislator of the ruling Democratic Justice Party and working-level officials, and returned home after a five-day stay. South Korea bans visits to North Korea.
