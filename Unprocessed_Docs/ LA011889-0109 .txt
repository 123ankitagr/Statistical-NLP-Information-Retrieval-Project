Two men believed to be involved in a Costa Mesa robbery led police on a high-speed chase through county streets and three freeways Tuesday before one was arrested at a hospital, authorities said. 
The pursuit began in Costa Mesa about 7 a.m. when an officer was questioning two men who had been sleeping in a car on Coriander Drive and they sped off, Costa Mesa Police Lt. Gary Webster said. 
The California Highway Patrol and Tustin police officers joined the pursuit as the men drove on the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, through Tustin surface streets, and south on the Santa Ana Freeway. 
Orange County sheriff's deputies received calls from Laguna Hills residents reporting that two men were seen jumping fences and running through the neighborhood. Police arrested David Chris Medina, 28, of El Monte at Saddleback Community Hospital after a resident told officers that her husband had taken a man there when he came to their door and asked for help for a cut hand. 
Medina was in Costa Mesa City Jail on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon, felony evasion of arrest and attempted burglary. The other man remains at large. 
Officers found the car abandoned at Paseo de Alicia and Hon Avenue in Laguna Hills. Inside, they found a black jacket that matched the description of one worn by a man who robbed a Denny's restaurant on Harbor Boulevard at 2 a.m. Tuesday, Webster said.
