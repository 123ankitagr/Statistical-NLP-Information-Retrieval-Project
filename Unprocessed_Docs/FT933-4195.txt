SOUTH KOREA warned yesterday that it might toughen its stance against North
Korea on the nuclear weapons issue unless Pyongyang resumes contacts with
Seoul by tomorrow, writes John Burton in Seoul.
North Korea last week offered to hold inter-Korean talks concerning the
inspection of its nuclear facilities, but it later added preconditions for
the meeting it had proposed for tomorrow.
It demanded that Seoul stop its support of international efforts to force
nuclear inspections, and end 'nuclear war games', an apparent reference to
its annual Team Spirit military exercise with the US. Mr Hwang In-sung,
South Korean prime minister, in rejecting the conditions told Mr Kang
Song-san, the North Korean premier, that Pyongyang's demand 'makes it
doubtful if your side has a genuine intention of reopening dialogue'.
North Korea suspended regular contacts with Seoul at the beginning of the
year in protest against the holding of the Team Spirit exercise. It failed
to appear at a meeting yesterday to discuss procedural matters for the talks
tomorrow.
If North Korea boycotts that meeting, it could lead to the end of hopes for
an quick resolution to the North Korean nuclear issue.
The US and South Korea have suggested they may ask the United Nations
Security Council to impose economic sanctions on North Korea if Pyongyang
does not make progress in nuclear inspection talks with both the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and Seoul by the end of month.
North Korea last week held inconclusive talks with the IAEA on allowing its
inspectors to examine two nuclear waste sites that are at the heart of the
dispute.
The IAEA, which has heard no response yet from Pyongyang for a proposed new
round of talks in Vienna, will discuss the issue at its next governors'
meeting on September 21.
The IAEA wants to inspect North Korea's facilities to determine whether
Pyongyang is producing more plutonium than it has reported to the agency.
