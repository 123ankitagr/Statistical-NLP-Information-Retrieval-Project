Two Los Angeles police officers escaped injury Wednesday when their helicopter rolled over during takeoff from a La Verne airfield, police said. 
The Bell 206 JetRanger, one of the older helicopters in the department's fleet, was taking off from Brackett Field when the accident occurred, Sgt. Brent Carey said. 
Officers Bob Kercy and Bud Nowell, who were on board the aircraft, were not hurt, but "there was extensive damage to the airframe," Carey said. 
No financial estimate of the damage was available. 
Department officials have been trying to update the helicopter fleet, saying that many of the crafts are too old for use. The helicopter involved in Wednesday's accident will be rebuilt, Carey added.
