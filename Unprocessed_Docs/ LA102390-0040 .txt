Lenny's Legacy: Leonard Bernstein decided two weeks before he died to use a $100,000 arts award he had won to further musical education, the prize sponsor said Monday. 
Bernstein, who died Oct. 14, will be honored posthumously with a Praemium Imperiale award today in Tokyo. The other winners are director Federico Fellini, architect James Stirling, sculptor Arnaldo Pomodoro and painter Antoni Tapies. The maestro's prize money will be used to establish the Bernstein Education Through the Arts Fund. BETH KLEID
