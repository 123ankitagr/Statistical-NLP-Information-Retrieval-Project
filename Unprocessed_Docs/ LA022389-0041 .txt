A San Diego man who police suspect robbed an East San Diego apartment that was being fumigated died Wednesday at Villa View Hospital, a coroner's spokesman said. 
Willie Davis, 40, was taken to the hospital in critical condition early Tuesday when he was found collapsed in an alley connecting 43rd Street and Van Dyke Avenue. 
Authorities said Davis entered a two-story apartment building in the 3700 block of 43rd Street about 2:20 a.m. Tuesday. The building was being sprayed with methyl bromide for termites. He fled the apartment shortly after entering. 
Police spokesman Bill Robinson said rings, gold necklaces, a roll of silver half-dollars and watches were found on Davis.
