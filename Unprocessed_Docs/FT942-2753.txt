Shares in Hasbro lost nearly 10 per cent of their value yesterday after the
world's largest toy maker warned that it may only break even in the second
quarter.
The group, perhaps best known for its Barney, Batman and Jurassic Park
licensed products, told investors that revenues in the three months to the
end of June could fall 15 per cent short of the level reached in the
corresponding period of 1993. The revenue decline 'could all but eliminate'
earnings in the current quarter, it said.
A year ago, Hasbro posted net income of Dollars 27.1m, or 30 cents a share,
on sales of Dollars 515m.
The warning surprised Wall Street. The stock finished down Dollars 3 at
Dollars 28 1/2 on heavy volume of 3.6m shares on the American Stock
Exchange.
The company said the unfavourable year-on-year comparisons were largely a
matter of timing, and did not reflect any fundamental operational
difficulties. The introduction of the popular Barney and Jurassic Park lines
in the 1993 quarter had helped Hasbro achieve a record quarter last year. In
1994, new products were scheduled to be launched later in the year.
