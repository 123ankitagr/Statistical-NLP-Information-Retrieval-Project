Mrs Birgit Breuel, president of the Treuhand agency, yesterday announced
that a record 562 former east German state companies were privatised in
June, but admitted the agency's debts had mounted to more than DM200bn
(Pounds 68.9bn), writes Leslie Colitt from Berlin.
The Truehand's debts now look set to exceed government estimates of DM250bn
by the end of 1994, as the agency increasingly turns to costly restructuring
of otherwise unsaleable companies. Mrs Breuel said there were also charges
arising from the extensive ecological damage caused by east German
companies.
