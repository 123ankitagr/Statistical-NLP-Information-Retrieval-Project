The Soviet Union has presented medals to President Bush's son, Jeb Bush, and grandson, George P. Bush, for helping victims of the December, 1988, earthquake in Armenia, the White House announced today. 
Medals and certificates of appreciation were given to the two Bushes by Soviet Ambassador Yuri Dubinin at the White House earlier this week. 
Jeb Bush, 37, and George P. Bush, 14, were among the volunteers who accompanied a relief airlift to Armenia two weeks after the quake. The airlift brought 100,000 pounds of medicine, clothing and other supplies to earthquake victims.
