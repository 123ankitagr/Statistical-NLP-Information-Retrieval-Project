Portugal is to privatise two railway lines and build one to be run as a
private concession, Reuter reports from Lisbon.
Transport Minister Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral said the government would
invite bids to build a private railway from central Lisbon to suburbs on the
southern bank of the Tagus. The lines to be sold are the 18-mile railway
from Lisbon to Cascais and the line from Lisbon to the Algarve.
