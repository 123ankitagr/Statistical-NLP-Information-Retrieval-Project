King World Productions, which distributes "Wheel of Fortune" and "Jeopardy!," is venturing beyond its normal syndication base with its first advertiser-supported network TV project, "Christmas in America: A Love Story." Kenny Rogers will star in the drama that will air on NBC and be sponsored by K mart. The special, inspired by last year's best-selling photo anthology, finds Rogers as a globe-trotting photographer who looks back on his life. Rogers himself is an amateur photographer. King World and K mart also are tied to another holiday special featuring Martha Stewart, author-lecturer and K mart spokeswoman, scheduled to air in November and December on Lifetime cable.
