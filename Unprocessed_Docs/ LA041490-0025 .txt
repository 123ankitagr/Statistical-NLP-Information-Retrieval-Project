Agoura High's Brian Smith has signed a national letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona State in the fall. Smith, a 6-foot-5 infielder/pitcher who is batting .353, has been limited to six games this season because of a broken bone in his left wrist. 
Smith, an All-Frontier League selection who hit .449 last year, also visited UC Santa Barbara. He chose Arizona State, whose team is ranked first in the nation by Baseball America, after a January visit. 
Smith, who signed Wednesday, canceled visits to USC and UCLA. The Sun Devils recruited him as a first baseman. 
"You can't ask for anything more in a program," Smith said. 
The Cal State Northridge cycling team will host a bicycle race for Western Collegiate Cycling Conference teams today near Piru. 
Individual and team time-trial races will be held along the 25 kilometer course. Medals and trophies will be awarded at a ceremony in Warring Park in Piru. 
Barbara Tanner, a 6-foot-3 freshman forward who played for the Oregon State women's basketball team last season, has transferred to Pepperdine. 
Tanner of Thousand Oaks High was The Times' 1989 Ventura County Player of the Year.
