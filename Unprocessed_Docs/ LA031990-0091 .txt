A fire in the engine room of a cruise ship off Australia killed one crew member and injured another Sunday, but the blaze was put out before it could reach the 1,200 passengers or disable the vessel. 
P&O Sitmar Cruises, owners of the Fairstar, said a 44-year-old boiler attendant died after suffering burns to 75% of his body during what was to be a routine testing of an auxiliary boiler. 
The ship was off the New South Wales state coast and heading back to Sydney after a 10-day cruise when the fire occurred.
