Dr Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia's prime minister, has unleashed a strong
attack on what he considers to be biased and ill-informed reporting on
events in Asia by the Western media, writes Kieran Cooke in Kuala Lumpur
'Their main idea is how to create friction and instability, so that if we
are unstable they can compete with us,' said Dr Mahathir.
Dr Mahathir, sharply critical of the West on a number of issues ranging from
the environment and human rights to matters of trade, questioned the motives
behind the recent purchase of a Hong Kong-based TV satellite network by Mr
Rupert Murdoch, the media entrepreneur.
Mr Murdoch recently paid Dollars 525m (Pounds 352m) for a 63.6 per cent
stake in Hutchvision, the Hong Kong-based parent company of Star TV. Star TV
is Asia's leading satellite TV network.
