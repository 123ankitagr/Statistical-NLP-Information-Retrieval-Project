San Diego dancer Michelle Schumacher was only a teen-ager in 1985, when she was spotted at a cattle call and cast for a starring role in Starlight's "A Chorus Line." After that, she became a familiar face in the musical theater scene around town -- until she took a hiatus in Los Angeles to sharpen her skills. Schumacher is back on stage now, in the Lawrence Welk Village Theater's production of "Promises Promises," where she will remain through May 6.
