Mayor Marion Barry asked Friday to meet with Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh over press reports that federal investigators have been told the mayor smoked crack cocaine on several occasions. 
In a letter to Thornburgh, Barry said disclosures concerning the Justice Department's investigation into his links with convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis have damaged his ability to govern the city. 
He said he hoped Thornburgh would follow U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens' request for a full investigation into the disclosures. 
'Fundamental Principles' 
"This is an issue bigger than Marion Barry Jr. and the politics of the District of Columbia," Barry said in the letter. "It is about the fundamental principles upon which our system of laws is based." 
David Runkel, the Justice Department's chief spokesman, refused Friday to comment directly on the mayor's request, but indicated that an inquiry is standard in such cases. 
"You can assume whenever there is an unauthorized disclosure of information, there will be an investigation," Runkel said.
