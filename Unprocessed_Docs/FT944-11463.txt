Hatchbacks with load spaces are useful but many feel saloon cars with boots
have more style. Yet, Peugeot calls its latest 306 four-door a sedan. I
thought low gearing made the poshest two-litre ST model I drove sound fussy
at motorway cruising speeds. It was nippy in town, rode with Peugeot's usual
shock absorbency, and had exceptional space inside. Prices are from Pounds
11,565 to Pounds 13,850.
