Children from more than 30 children's hospitals and homes for abused and handicapped children will be treated to various feats of magic at the Miracle of Magic Show today at Anaheim High School. 
Organized by the Sunshine for Children Foundation, a nonprofit organization based in Westminster, organizers will be giving away 1,500 Simpsons T-shirts and serving pizza and hot dogs to the more than 1,000 kids. 
The children's magic show will run from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. An adult, Las Vegas-style magic show will follow, featuring illusionist Richard Diamond. 
Sponsors for the event include pop stars Madonna and Paula Abdul, comedian Andrew Dice Clay, Rams quarterback Jim Everett and John Bower, who supplied $8,000 worth of Simpson T-shirts. Limited tickets for the adult magic show at the school at 811 Lincoln Ave. can be purchased at the door for $3.
