Reputed Gambino godfather John Gotti, unruffled after a night in jail, today pleaded innocent to charges that he ordered the shooting of a labor leader and was released on $100,000 bail. 
An associate also charged with first-degree assault and fourth-degree conspiracy, Anthony (Tony Lee) Guerrieri, was released on $50,000 bond. Acting state Supreme Court Justice George Roberts ordered Gotti's release on bail after receiving assurances that he would not flee the area. An indictment charged that Gotti recruited two members of a notorious Irish gang to maim a union leader, John O'Connor, who had wrecked a Mafia-run restaurant. (Story on Page 4.)
