In your editorial does the reference to "the arrogant cant of unthinking zealots" include the criticisms of countless medical doctors who have spoken out against animal experimentation? 
Among these enlightened physicians was Dr. Charles Mayo, founder of the world-renowed Mayo Clinic, who said, "I abhor vivisection. It should at least be curbed. Better, it should be abolished. I know of no achievement through vivisection, no scientific discovery, that could not have been obtained without such barbarism and cruelty. The whole thing is evil."
