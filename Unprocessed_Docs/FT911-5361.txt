Metal workers in Brazil's main industrial area begin an indefinite strike
over pay today - their first sector-wide action since President Collor took
office a year ago, Christina Lamb writes from Rio de Janeiro.
The 'strategic strike' by metal workers of Sao Paulo state is intended to
paralyse production. Of Brazil's main car manufacturers only Fiat, which is
based in the state of Minas Gerais, will be left operating.
