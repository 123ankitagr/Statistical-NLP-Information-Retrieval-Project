The battle against a forest fire that killed a Fontana firefighter was marked by the use of inexperienced crews and a lack of medical equipment, a report says. 
Whether those problems contributed to Kenneth Enslow's death or hampered efforts to rescue him has yet to be determined by authorities investigating last August's Mendocino National Forest fire. The accident report by U.S. Forest Service and state Department of Forestry and Fire officials was obtained by the San Bernardino Sun under the Freedom of Information Act. The firefighter's parents, Melvin and Valerie Enslow, criticized the lack of medical equipment and training cited by investigators.
