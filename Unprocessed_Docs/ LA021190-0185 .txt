A helicopter on a sightseeing trip around Manhattan and carrying four tourists and a pilot went down in the East River, bursting into flames after it crashed into the water near a helipad, authorities said. 
Police divers and a rescuer in a life raft aided the passengers and pilot, with some of the survivors holding onto a board extended by the boater until help arrived, witnesses said. Eight people, including three rescuers, were taken to the hospital. A 14-year-old boy on the helicopter was in critical condition after his heart stopped, police said. Authorities said they were investigating the crash.
