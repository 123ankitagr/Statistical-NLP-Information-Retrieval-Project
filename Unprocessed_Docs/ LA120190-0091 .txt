Actor Lorenzo Lamas, who portrayed Lance Cumson on television's "Falcon Crest" series, tried to break up a fight at a Universal City movie theater between two cousins who turned on him, punching him in the face, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reported Friday. 
Lamas, 32, of Los Angeles, sustained a small cut on his forehead in the scuffle that broke out Thursday in a theater at the Cineplex Odeon, said Deputy Rich Erickson. 
James Stewart, 21, of Meriden, Conn., and Robert Halliday, 23, of Mt. Laurel, N.J., were issued citations for misdemeanor battery and released without bail, Erickson said. 
It was not known why they were fighting. "They are cousins and they said it was a family matter." Lt. Don Swift said. Stewart and Halliday apparently did not know who Lamas was. 
Lamas is the son of the late actor Fernando Lamas and actress Arlene Dahl.
