China and Taiwan have narrowed differences on issues affecting their
day-to-day relationship, but are little closer to resolving wider political
concerns after five days of talks in Beijing, Tony Walker writes from
Beijing.
Spokesman for 'unofficial' Chinese and Taiwanese organisations involved in
the discussions said they had made progress on issues such as repatriating
hijackers, returning illegal immigrants, settling disputes among fishermen
and intellectual property rights.
