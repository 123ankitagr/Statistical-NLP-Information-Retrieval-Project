Although German bonds ended Friday on a firmer note after a late
short-squeeze in the futures pits, traders are forecasting another volatile
week ahead.
With key money supply and inflation numbers out of the way for now and the
Bundesbank's central bank council away for its Easter break, the market will
have little fundamental news to focus on, leaving it vulnerable to further
turbulence in the international bond markets.
Meanwhile, after Bundesbank president Mr Hans Tietmeyer's latest affirmation
that booming M3 money supply growth cannot be ignored, 'the focus will be on
how the Bundesbank will act after the M3 numbers,' said Mr Klaus Baader, an
economist at Lehman Brothers. M3 grew at an annualised rate of 17.6 per cent
in February, well above its 4 to 6 per cent target.
However, the Bundesbank is expected to continue lowering its rate for
securities repurchase agreements. It fell eight basis points to 5.80 per
cent last week.
In spite of last week's encouraging inflation data and recent moderate wage
settlements, investors remain cautious amid fears of further US interest
rate tightening. 'There's a significant amount of liquidity around that has
to return to the market - but when that will happen, no one knows,' sighed a
dealer.
