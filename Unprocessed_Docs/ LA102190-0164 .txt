Your editorial "A Mayor or a Marshmallow" (Oct. 11) leads me to the conclusion you're out of touch with the citizens of Irvine. The voters spoke by a 52%-48% vote to not reelect Larry Agran. 
You do a disservice to the city voters when you fail to recognize what in most elections would be considered a landslide. 
You're right when you said we failed to reelect an international diplomat in Agran. I question your description, however. We defeated a man who put his own political ambitions ahead of the interests of Irvine. 
Every city with an elected mayor is governed by machine politics. Mayor Bradley is out raising $750,000 to cover legal fees for his conflict-of-interest lawsuit. Is Sacramento better now that we have paid career politicians controlled by lobbyists, instead of our former citizen politicians? 
I am a very independent voter -- and I'm not a supporter of Sally Anne Sheridan -- but to call her a pothole-fixing mayor is demeaning. You should look at one of the cleanest political cities in the United States -- Cincinnati -- the mayor elected by fellow councilmen, no political machine, just honest government serving the people. 
We've got a lot of wounds to bind in this city. Your editorial contributes nothing to it. It just illustrates that the media -- like Congress -- are out of touch.
