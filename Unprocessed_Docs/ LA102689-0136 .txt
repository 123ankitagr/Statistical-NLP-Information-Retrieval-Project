A North Hollywood High School football player was jailed in connection with a shooting at Van Nuys Grant High School, just as the Grant football team was breaking practice. No one was injured. 
The shooting took place after five students from North Hollywood went to Grant, allegedly to seek revenge for a fight at a party. As many as seven shots were fired, according to Sid Thompson, deputy superintendent for operations of the Los Angeles Unified School District.
