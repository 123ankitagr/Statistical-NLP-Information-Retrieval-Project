A teacher at Gompers Secondary School pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he molested eight girls. 
Sidney Loveless, 54, of San Diego, was ordered to appear Sept. 7 for a preliminary hearing in San Diego Municipal Court. 
Judge Patricia Cowett allowed Loveless to remain free on his own recognizance. 
The alleged molestation by the Southeast San Diego teacher is believed to have occurred last September through April. 
He was removed from his classroom at Gompers at the start of the investigation in early April.
