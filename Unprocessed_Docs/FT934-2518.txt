Mr David Lange, former New Zealand prime minister, was appointed foreign
affairs spokesman in the shadow cabinet by Ms Helen Clark, opposition Labour
party leader yesterday, writes Terry Hall in Wellington. Mr Lange is widely
held responsible for a rift with the US, Britain and Australia from 1984
when he was foreign affairs minister and premier. Then, New Zealand banned
visits by nuclear-armed vessels, legislation over which led to the break-up
of the post-war Anzus treaty.
