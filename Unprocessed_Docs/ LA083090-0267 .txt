The controversial rap group, 2 Live Crew, will broadcast its Nov. 8 performance at the Country Club in Reseda live via satellite in a pay-per-view cable television concert. 
The Miami rap group is slated to perform material from their notorious "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album, which was declared obscene June 6 by a federal judge in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Twenty percent of the concert proceeds are earmarked for the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation's Musical Majority to Fight Censorship. The group hopes to attract a potential 14 million viewers.
