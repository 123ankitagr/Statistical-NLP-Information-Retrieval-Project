Barry Sanders never did it. Neither did Billy Sims, or Johnny Rodgers, or Mike Rozier or any other Heisman Trophy winner produced by the Big Eight. 
Not once -- until Saturday -- had a Big Eight rookie made his rushing debut with a 200-yard game. 
Blaise Bryant, who led the nation's junior college rushers last year, rolled up 213 yards on 27 carries as Iowa State swamped Ohio University, 28-3, in its season opener at Ames. 
The 6-foot-1, 200-pound Bryant, a Cypress High and Golden West College product, said he carried the ball "more than I expected to." 
"I made a lot of mistakes, like cutting the wrong way or slipping, but I need to thank the offensive line for making my mistakes turn into gains," said Bryant.
