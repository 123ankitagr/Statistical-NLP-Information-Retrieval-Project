A recruiter for the Ku Klux Klan has been fired as a part-time police officer because of his involvement with the racist organization, the chairwoman of the town's Board of Selectmen said Tuesday. 
Thomas Herman, 28, of Exeter, was fired nearly two months after he was suspended from police duties because of the controversy resulting from his klan activities. 
Betsy Coes, who chairs the Newfields Board of Selectmen, said residents told the board they would not call police if they knew Herman was on duty.
