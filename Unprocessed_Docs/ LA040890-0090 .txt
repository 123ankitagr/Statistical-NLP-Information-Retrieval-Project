Washington Mayor Marion Barry has rejected a suggestion from his attorney that he plead guilty to misdemeanor cocaine possession to keep prosecutors from showing a videotape of his allegedly smoking crack, sources close to the mayor said. Barry was told that the plea could aid chances of being acquitted on other, more serious perjury charges, sources said.
