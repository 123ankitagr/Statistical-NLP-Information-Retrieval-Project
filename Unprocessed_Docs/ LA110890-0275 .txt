Westside schools just got their report cards -- results of how well their students performed on the California Assessment Program tests. 
Results were mixed, and so were the responses of local administrators. 
Coeur d'Alene Avenue School in Venice got test scores that might have induced apoplexy in Beverly Hills, whose schools routinely rank among the state's best. But although Coeur d'Alene ranked in the bottom half of California schools, Principal Beth G. Ojena said she felt pretty good about the scores. 
As she pointed out, students at the Venice elementary school -- a quarter of them homeless and a third newly arrived immigrants -- showed slight to significant gains over last year in all areas tested: reading, written expression and mathematics. 
Coeur d'Alene sixth-graders did better than the Los Angeles Unified School District average. Ojena attributed some of the school's improvement to the donation last year of a writing-to-read laboratory that helps the youngest students get a good foundation in language skills. She also noted that the school, which has one of the highest homeless populations in the country, received a $50,000 grant from the Weingart Foundation that allowed it to hire a tutor for its transient students. 
Tutoring is especially important for homeless students, Ojena said. Learning is sequential, she pointed out, and homeless students often drop out of a particular school, sometimes for as long as a year. 
According to the principal, writing has become a schoolwide priority. Teachers try to have students write daily, whatever they are studying. Students also correct each other's written work as a way of developing editorial skills. 
Ojena said she believes that performance on the CAP tests has to be viewed in context. For a student who is preoccupied with adjusting to a new culture and mastering English, the tests may not be especially relevant. 
"It's not that it's not important," she said. "It is. But when we test across the board, it's irrelevant to a lot of the kids, and that's why they test as low as they do." 
Given the complex needs of the student body, she said, "sometimes it's incredible to me we do as well as we do." 
Other administrators also urged that CAP scores be viewed in context. 
Vera Jashni, assistant superintendent for educational services for the Culver City Unified School District, said CAP scores can be a useful measure of how a school is doing, but only if other measures are also evaluated. 
"When you take any test in isolation, that's not good," she said. "It's only one part of the picture, and you've got to take the whole picture into consideration." 
Culver City's scores changed little from last year's, placing the district near the middle statewide. 
Jashni said her district looks at several measures in evaluating how well a school is performing. In addition to looking at CAP scores in written expression, for instance, the district may also evaluate portfolios that contain examples of students' writing over a period of time. 
Jashni said Culver City does no special preparation for CAP testing besides notifying parents and giving students the usual pre-test advice: Get a good night's sleep, eat breakfast and try to relax. 
Additionally, she said, the district hopes test day won't be too hot or rainy. 
Either one brings down scores. 
HOW TO READ THE SCORES 
These are results of the California Assessment Program test for third, sixth and eighth grades. 
State officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess schoolwide academic performance. Students do not receive individual scores. 
Schools are listed alphabetically by district. Scores are scaled between approximately 100 and 400, although a few scores may be higher or lower. A school's scores may be compared to district and state averages. For example, if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math, and the state average is 283, children at your school are performing at a higher level than most third-graders statewide. 
In general, a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm, although state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon the size of the school. 
Students in grades three and six last spring were given multiple-choice tests in reading, written language (including grammar and spelling) and mathematics. Last spring's eighth-graders were tested in reading, math, history-social sciences and science. Eighth-graders also took an essay test to assess their writing skills. Results of the essay test are expected next month. 
In some cases a specialized or "magnet" school has its campus on the grounds of a regular school. State officials have combined the scores, so separate results are not available. 
SAMPLE QUESTION FOR SIXTH-GRADERS  Illustrative social studies passage: 
In 1860, a Midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new plan which would affect our entire country. The company planned a faster mail service to California -- the Pony Express, which would deliver the mail in 10 days or less. 
Strong young men were the riders. Buffalo Bill was one of the famous ones. These men had to have courage. Every day they faced many kinds of danger. They had been told, "Remember, you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged. You may be cold, hungry, wet and tired, but you must go on! The mail must go through!" And it did go through! 
Over the saddle of the Pony Express horses was hung a leather blanket or "mochila." In the four pockets of it were the tissue-thin letters. Five dollars was the usual price for sending a letter. 
The route cut directly across from Missouri to Sacramento. Each rider rode nonstop for about 100 miles, and then a new rider took over. The horses used were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles. Quickly the mail was thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse, much like a relay race. Horses were saddled and ready to go at every station. With a leap, the rider was in the saddle -- and off like the wind!  Illustrative test questions: 
What do you think would usually happen when the rider reached Sacramento? 
a. He would go to New York. 
b. He would eat and rest. 
c. He would brand horses. 
d. He would meet Buffalo Bill. 
The "mochila" used by the Pony Express rider can best be compared to the 
a. sleeping bag used by the camper. 
b. sandpaper used by the carpenter. 
c. mail pouch used by the mail carrier. 
d. pen used to write and letter. 
You can conclude from the passage that 
a. someone at each station prepared a fresh horse for the rider. 
b. Buffalo Bill was bored by the Pony Express. 
c. the worst danger was from the cold. 
d. few people ever heard about the Pony Express.
