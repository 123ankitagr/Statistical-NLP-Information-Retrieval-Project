MR George Davies, former head of the Next clothing chain, is to launch a new
mail-order magazine next week. He calls it a 'magalogue' - a combination of
magazine and catalogue, Gary Mead writes.
The monthly publication will be given away free with some newspapers and
will also be on sale in branches of Dillons retail newsagents.
A partnership between Mr Davies and the Asda supermarket chain already sells
a range of Mr Davies' clothes.
