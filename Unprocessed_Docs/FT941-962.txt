South Korean President Kim Young-sam will mix business with diplomacy during
his visit to China, hoping to win new orders for Korean companies, John
Burton reports from Seoul.
Economic issues that will be discussed include the Chinese purchase of
Korean telephone exchanges, a proposed Sino-Korea project to develop and
market mid-sized commercial airliners and the participation of Korean
industry in China's infrastructure programme.
The two countries also plan to form an industrial co-operation committee to
promote business ties and technology exchanges.
North Korea has accused Washington and Seoul of risking a 'catastrophic
crisis' by putting their armed forces personnel on alert on the Korean
peninsula, Reuter adds from Tokyo.
'These provocative moves are very dangerous developments which may cause a
catastrophic crisis on the Korean peninsula,' said the official Korean
Central News Agency monitored in Tokyo.
