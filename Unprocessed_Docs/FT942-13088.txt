PSA Peugeot Citroen, the French carmaker, has ended its three year boycott
of the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (Acea) and has decided
to join the industry's main lobbying group in Europe. Peugeot has been
isolated in the European motor industry since late 1990, when Mr Jacques
Calvet, chief executive, refused to join the new lobbying group in a
disagreement over voting rights. Mr Calvet, the most vociferous opponent of
Japanese car imports in Europe, had insisted the association should operate
with the principle of unanimous decision-making, but the rest of the
industry had refused to grant the French carmaker a right of veto.
It is understood Peugeot has now decided to join Acea partly out of concern
that it might become isolated from future pan-European research and
development projects in the motor industry. The industry is about to form
the European Council for Automotive Research and Development (EUCAR) in
order to enhance the scope of European R&D collaboration.
