Mr Peter Bolliger, former managing director of Harrods, the Knightsbridge
department store, is in talks with C&J Clark about joining the family-owned
shoe company.
'We are looking at a possible new role in the company for him, with
executive responsibility,' Mr Kevin Crumplin, a main board director of
Clark, said yesterday.
Mr Bolliger's departure from Harrods in April provoked a bitter war of words
with Mr Mohamed al-Fayed, the store's co-owner. At the time Mr Bolliger said
of Mr al-Fayed: 'He likes to feel he is running the store. He will even go
behind a counter and cut salami.'
Mr Bolliger said he had resigned but Harrods said he had been ousted for
unsatisfactory performance, in particular his running of the Kurt Geiger
shoe chain.
Mr Crumplin, personnel director at Clark, said that one stumbling block for
Swiss-born Mr Bolliger was that his work permit 'is running to the end now'.
'There is no certainty that he is joining us because Peter is a foreign
national,' Mr Crumplin said. 'It's up to the Department of Employment
whether or not we can even proceed, and if we then proceed we've still got
to finalise what sort of job we'd want to give him.'
Clark is also talking to other candidates. Mr Crumplin said: 'Peter is a
great shoe guy and we talk to shoe men constantly. The only safe thing I can
say is that we are in discussion with Peter,'
Clark's shareholders narrowly rejected a Pounds 184m takeover bid from
Berisford International last year. In October it appointed Mr Roger Pedder
as chairman and is still to appoint a second external non-executive
director.
