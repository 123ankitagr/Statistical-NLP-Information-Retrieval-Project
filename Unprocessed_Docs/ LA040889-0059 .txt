Olympic basketball was opened to professional players Friday by an overwhelming vote. 
At a special session of FIBA, the international basketball federation, the United States cast one of 13 votes against the pro-eligibility plan. Fifty-nine countries voted for it. 
Dave Gavitt, the U.S. federation chief, said that much work had to be done before National Basketball Assn. players would be eligible to represent the United States at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992. 
The new eligibility rules, which apply to players in all professional leagues worldwide and at all FIBA-sanctioned tournaments, took effect immediately. 
The NBA issued a statement in New York, saying that the league and the players' union are working to develop a framework that will allow players to participate.
