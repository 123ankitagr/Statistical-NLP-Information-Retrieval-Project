MICROSOFT, the leading personal computer software publisher, reported record
revenues and profits for its third fiscal quarter, exceeding analysts
expectations, writes Louise Kehoe.
Third-quarter net income was Dollars 123.8m, or 98 cents per share, an
increase of 65 per cent over Dollars 75.2m, or 62 cents, in the
corresponding period a year ago.
Revenues for the quarter jumped 57 per cent to Dollars 486.9m from Dollars
310.9m in the same period last year.
Net income for the nine months rose 63 per cent to Dollars 324.3m, or
Dollars 2.61 per share, from Dollars 199.2m, or Dollars 1.69, a year ago.
Revenues for the nine months ended March 31, 1991, period were Dollars
1.3bn, 56 per cent more than the Dollars 846.5m recorded for the same period
of fiscal 1990.
Microsoft's performance is remarkable in light of slowing sales growth in
the personal computer market, particularly in the US.
The company said it achieved record revenues from both its retail sales of
applications programs and from sales of operating system software through
computer manufacturers.
