A 21-year-old woman who last fall achieved her goal of being a Playboy Playmate of the Month became the first black Playmate of the Year, the men's magazine announced today. 
"I don't think of myself as black or white," said Renee Tenison, who has a black father and a white mother. 
She will be featured in the June issue, which hits newsstands Wednesday. She was chosen by the Playboy staff, and Playboy founder Hugh Hefner gave the final nod. 
As Playboy's Miss November, the Boise woman was introduced to readers as "the best thing to come out of Idaho since the spud." 
Tenison, employed by a Boise electronics company, has done local modeling, including TV commercials and catalogue photos, besides posing for Playboy.
