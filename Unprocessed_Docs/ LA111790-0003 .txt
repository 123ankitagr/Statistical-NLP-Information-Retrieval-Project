Sudden heart rejection caused the death this week of 13-year-old Stormie Jones six years after she became the world's first heart-liver transplant recipient, doctors said. 
The autopsy results surprised Stormie's doctors at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pa., who said that heart rejection was rare so many years after a transplant. The girl needed the transplant because a rare genetic disorder prevented her body from processing cholesterol. She is to be buried today in her hometown in White Settlement, Tex.
