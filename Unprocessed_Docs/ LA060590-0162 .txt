Dr. Erich Foretich today denied a report that he is giving up the international custody battle for his 7-year-old daughter, Hilary, now living in New Zealand where she was secreted by her maternal grandparents. 
Foretich, in an interview published in New Zealand's Christchurch Star, was quoted as saying he was forced to accept that Hilary would live in New Zealand with her grandparents and Foretich's former wife, Dr. Elizabeth Morgan. 
The dental surgeon also was quoted as saying he would not pursue the custody case unless he had evidence that Hilary was in physical danger. 
The case has been before the New Zealand courts since Hilary was discovered living there in February. 
"While I continue to believe that protracted litigation is not in the best interest of my daughter, I continue to oppose Dr. Morgan's application for custody in New Zealand," Foretich said in a statement released through his U.S. attorney, Elaine Mittleman.
