I have a few questions for the Irvine resident who is outraged with the Irvine Police Department because her son was given a $96 ticket for failure to make a complete stop at a stop sign. 
You claim he was a first-time offender -- do you mean this was the first time he had failed to stop for a stop sign, or the first time he was caught? You compare his ticket with a friend you know of who received a less-expensive ticket for "the same offense." Did your friend only fail to stop, while your son may have failed to yield the right of way to another vehicle? Is it possible that the policeman who ticketed your son has seen too many bicycle-car accidents in which the bicyclist is seriously injured (and usually at fault)? 
And, finally, what kind of message are you giving your son about accepting responsibility for his actions as you leap to his defense?
