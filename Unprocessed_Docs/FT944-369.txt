IBCA, the European rating agency, has downgraded the long term rating of
Fisons, the drugs and scientific equipment company, from BBB+ to BBB. The
short term rating remains unchanged at A2.
IBCA said that Fisons' profits warnings with the interim results announced
in September, came after four years of deteriorating income coverage ratios.
'With only limited cash generated by operations, it is difficult to see
where long term support for the large capital and R&D expenditure will come
from, although in the short term further disposals could be made,' IBCA
said.
