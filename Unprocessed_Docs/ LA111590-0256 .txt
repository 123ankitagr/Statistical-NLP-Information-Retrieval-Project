Book publisher Simon & Schuster said today that it will not release "American Psycho," a violent new novel by critically acclaimed author Bret Easton Ellis. 
Chairman Richard E. Snyder released a statement saying the book, which was scheduled to be shipped to stores next month, will not be handled by Simon & Schuster. 
Ellis' publicist said the decision smacks of censorship. 
Ellis, 26, is the author of the critically praised novel "Less Than Zero," which depicts a morally decadent lifestyle among children of upper-income families in Los Angeles. 
The statement offered no further explanation for the new book's cancellation. But Snyder told the Washington Post: "In my opinion, there was an incorrect decision" by editors who bought the book and approved its publication. 
"American Psycho," the story of a young, successful Wall Street businessman who can't stop killing people, was criticized for its vivid descriptions of violence against women.
