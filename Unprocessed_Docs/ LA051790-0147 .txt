Top-seeded Mira Costa High will travel to meet Newport Harbor at 7:30 tonight in the quarterfinals of the Southern Section 4-A boys' volleyball playoffs. 
The match was moved up a day because Newport Harbor's prom is Friday night. 
"I wouldn't want them laboring under that problem," said Mira Costa Coach Mike Cook, who had to agree to the change. "If my kids had the prom that night, I would hope my opponent would allow us to have the game early. Maybe someone will do me a favor someday." 
Newport Harbor (11-5), which won the 4-A title in 1987, is led by setter Alex Opoulos, freshman outside hitter Mark McAnlis and 6-foot-3 middle blocker Ian Juberg. The Sailors defeated Leuzinger in the first round Friday, 12-15, 15-4, 15-6, 15-4. 
Mira Costa (19-0) advanced with a 15-4, 15-5, 15-6 victory over Dos Pueblos of Goleta. The Mustangs have four players who have signed with major colleges: outside hitter David Swatik (UCLA), middle blockers Pat Ivie and Mike Ashenfelter (USC) and setter Canyon Ceman (Stanford). ROB FERNAS
