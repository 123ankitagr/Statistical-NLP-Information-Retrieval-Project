PRESIDENT Bill Clinton has appointed Mr Thomas Pickering, one of the State
Department's most senior and respected professional diplomats, to be US
ambassador to Moscow. He takes over from Mr Robert Strauss.
Mr Pickering is best known as President George Bush's ambassador to the
United Nations from 1989 to 1992, a post in which he won universal acclaim.
He will move from being ambassador to India and has served as ambassador to
Israel, Jordan, Nigeria and El Salvador.
The 61-year-old Mr Pickering was summoned from New Delhi to Little Rock
during the transition between the Bush and Clinton administrations, and was
assumed to be under consideration for the post of deputy secretary of state.
He is expected to work closely with Mr Strobe Talbott, the Time magazine
columnist appointed ambassador at large for the states of the former Soviet
Union.
The appointment of a professional diplomat to Moscow is expected to reassure
career State Department officials, who complain that more and more
ambassadorial posts go to amateurs whose sole qualifications are financial
contributions to election campaigns.
Mr Warren Christopher, the new Secretary of State, promised his staff this
week that he would not allow embassies to be bought in this fashion.
