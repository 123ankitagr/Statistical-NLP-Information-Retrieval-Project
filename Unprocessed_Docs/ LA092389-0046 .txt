Grant Marches Through Marshall, Even Without Booker, in 20-7 Win 
With Grant High's best offensive player out because of a sprained ankle, the Lancers drove to scores as slowly as the team's bus on its return from Marshall. 
Struggling without Shawn Booker, Grant (2-0) scored on two time-consuming drives and posted a 20-7 nonleague win Friday for its third consecutive victory over the Barristers. Booker scored three touchdowns last season against Marshall. 
The Lancers' quickest touchdown came when Marlowe Lewis returned a blocked field-goal attempt 69 yards to give Grant a 14-7 lead with 1:22 left in the first half. The longest scoring drive, which came after the opening kickoff, took 10 minutes, 6 seconds. Grant moved 75 yards in 18 plays, Lewis scoring on a seven-yard quarterback option. Lewis was the leading rusher with 61 yards in 11 carries. He also completed three of nine passes for 66 yards. 
Grant completed the scoring on a drive that consumed nearly seven minutes in the third quarter with Marcel Desir scoring on a one-yard run. 
Marshall (0-2) took 13 seconds to tie the score after Marlowe's keeper when Danny Altruz returned the ensuing kickoff 81 yards. Altruz had 181 yards in return yardage. 
The Lancers were penalized 16 times for 122 yards. SEAN WATERS
