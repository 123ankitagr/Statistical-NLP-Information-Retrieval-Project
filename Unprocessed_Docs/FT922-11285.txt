GEC ALSTHOM has been chosen by Siman (Syndicat Intercommunual a Vocation
Multiple de l'Agglomeration Nantaise) to supply a further 12 three-car
tramsets for the Nantes urban transport network.
The tramsets, which are valued at approximately Pounds 18.5m, will be
delivered between September 1993 and March 1994. They will be using the same
technology as those previously ordered and will be fully adapted for use by
physically impaired passengers.
Line 2 (city centre-south) will start operation later this year. It will be
serviced by tramsets already in use on Line 1 and by units currently being
delivered by GEC Alsthom.
The 12 additional tramsets will be used for Line 3 which is scheduled to
open in 1994 to extend Line 2 to the north of the city. They will also be
able to run on the other lines of the network
the total number of the company's three-car tramsets running on the Nantes
network, which will be 24 kilometres long when Line 3 is opened.
