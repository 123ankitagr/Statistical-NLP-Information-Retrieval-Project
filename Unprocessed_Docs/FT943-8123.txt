Celebrating the 100th day of the multi-party government of national unity,
South African president Nelson Mandela makes his way to address the Cape
Town parliament. In a speech which was broadcast live nationwide, Mr Mandela
promised co-ordinated programmes to transform society post-apartheid, but
gave little detail of proposed socio-economic development projects and made
only a passing reference to the country's desperate need for millions of new
homes. Report, Page 4
