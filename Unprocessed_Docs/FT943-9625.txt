The movie Ruthless People (9.00 ITV) is quite funny by modern standards:
Bette Midler plays a shrew of a wife who is kidnapped, much to the joy of
her husband (Danny DeVito) and makes the life of her kidnappers hell.
Unfortunately ITV is showing a version censored for American television, so
perhaps it will make more sense to watch Witness. This is a documentary
marking the 25th anniversary of the murder of film star Sharon Tate by
Charles Manson and his gang. The thesis here is that the Manson murder
became a political symbol in the US and brought to an end the 'peace and
flower power' era of the 1960s (9.00 C4). By all accounts the short drama by
Andrew Davies in BBC2's Stages series, A Few Short Journeys Of The Heart, is
another of those high technology production numbers which television
occasionally tries in the effort to break out of the prison of filmed
naturalism (9.25). In BBC1's big documentary series The Human Animal,
Desmond Morris moves on from the hunting instinct to the way in which man's
shelter has developed so rapidly, from mud hut to skyscraper (9.30).
