A Hollywood man was ordered Tuesday to stand trial for murder in the January slaying of Newport Beach ophthalmologist Boonkert Chulapatrcheevin. 
Harbor Municipal Court Judge Glenn A. Mahler, closing out a 4-day preliminary hearing in the Newport Beach court, ruled there was enough evidence to order Allen J. Lindsey, 23, bound over for trial on a murder charge. 
Chulapatrcheevin, 45, a native of Thailand, was found dead of a stab wound Jan. 19 in his Balboa Peninsula duplex. Five days later, police arrested Lindsey in Hollywood after he was found driving the doctor's missing Mercedes-Benz 560-SL. 
Lindsey and his attorney have maintained that the Hollywood man killed the doctor in self-defense and have suggested that the pair may have been homosexually linked.
