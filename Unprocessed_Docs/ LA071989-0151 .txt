Bowler Ron Mohr's run-in with a moose has cost him a chance to participate in the U.S. Olympic Festival. 
Mohr of Anchorage, Alaska, was bicycling as part of his training when he swerved to avoid hitting the moose. He fell from his bicycle, breaking his right collarbone and right arm. 
Mohr, 33, and a member of Team USA, will be replaced at the festival by Stan Wright of Birmingham, Ala.
