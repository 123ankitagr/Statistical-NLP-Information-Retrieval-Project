Sir, Cato the Elder ended every speech with the demand that Carthage must be
destroyed. Vanessa Houlder is becoming almost as repetitive in her gloomy
prognostications about Docklands (The property market, May 8). The
difference is that, unlike Ms Houlder, Cato did not use selective
quotations.
She correctly quotes the ADT architectural guide as saying that 'London's
Docklands contains one of the worst collections of late 20th century
buildings to be seen anywhere in the world'. But she omits the
counter-balance - the guide also states: 'And yet it is to Docklands that
you must go to find some of the best British architecture of the 1980s. The
gems are few, but, compared with anywhere else in the UK today, the
concentration is high and the quality rare.'
One would expect Financial Times writers to be aware of Docklands
architectural successes. After all, your own print works in East India Dock
Road has won eight architectural awards and commendations, and is described
in the ADT guide as 'beyond doubt, the finest building in Docklands to
date'.
