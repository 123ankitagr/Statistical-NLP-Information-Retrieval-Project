RUSSIAN presidential power will dominate every other institution of the
state if the country backs President Boris Yeltsin in tomorrow's referendum
on the country's future, Mr Yeltsin promised yesterday.
A poll published by Izvestia showed that Mr Yeltsin was supported by 57 per
cent of those who would vote on the first question - do you trust the
president? Voters were equally divided over the second question, on support
for Mr Yeltsin's economic programme. Voters will also be asked if they want
early elections for president and parliament.
Mr Yeltsin hinted he would push through the new constitution against all
opposition.
