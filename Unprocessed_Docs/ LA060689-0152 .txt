Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan predicted today that Thailand could benefit from an influx of foreign investment prompted by the turmoil in China. 
A government spokesman said Chatichai told a Cabinet meeting that government agencies should prepare for investment from companies that currently have interests in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
Thai officials said many multinational companies were expected soon to shift their investments from China and Hong Kong to Thailand because of troubles in China and a related crisis of confidence in the British colony.
