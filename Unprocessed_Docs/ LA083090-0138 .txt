Thrifty Corp., which recently appointed a new president, announced a series of additional management changes. The key change was the promotion of Christian K. Bement to senior vice president for industrial relations for the holding company, which is the parent of seven drugstore and sporting goods chains. 
Previously, Bement held the same title with the company's Thrifty Drug Stores unit. 
He will report to Daniel Siegel, who was named president and chief operating officer on Aug. 8. 
In some of the other moves at the Thrifty Drug Stores unit, Robert LaFerriere was promoted from vice president for buying to senior vice president for buying, sales and merchandise display. 
John J. Greer, formerly vice president for regional manager operations, was promoted to senior vice president in charge of all store operations. He succeeds Ellis H. Axelrod, who quit Thrifty to pursue other interests.
