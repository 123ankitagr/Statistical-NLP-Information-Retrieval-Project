San Diego State linebacker Lou Foster left practice Friday morning early with a pulled hamstring. 
Brian Barry, SDSU head trainer, said Foster will likely miss a couple of days. 
Also, SDSU Coach Al Luginbill confirmed that freshman tight end Marc Ziegler, a Mira Mesa graduate, will redshirt this season. Ziegler suffered a broken right collarbone Thursday diving for a ball. SCOTT MILLER
