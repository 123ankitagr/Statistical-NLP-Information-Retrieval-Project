Landed good general demand,report the Tea Brokers' Association. Better
liquoring East African teas remained fully firm. Mediums were well supported
but prices tended easier. Plainer descriptions met less enquiry at easier
rates. Offshore fair demand with Ceylons a good feature. Brightest teas were
dearer: others barely steady. Quotations quality 150p nom, good medium 135p,
medium 100p,low medium 82p. The highest price realised this week was 150p
for a Rwanda pf. 1.
