Star Player: Jurgen Klinsmann
Country: Germany
Club: Monaco (also: Stuttgart Kickers, Stuttgart, Inter Milan, Real Madrid)
Age: 29
Klinsmann was a gymnast in his youth and is his team's best bet for goals.
When he stays on his feet he is fast and flamboyant, capable of scoring
great goals and missing easy ones. But some of his spectacular tumbles in
the opponents' box have been followed by penalty goals as decisive as goals
scored on the run. These penalties beat Argentina in the final and
Czechoslovakia in the quarter-final in 1990. He now leads an ageing corps of
strikers; during the recent defeat against Ireland in Hanover the fans were
reduced to calling for the 34-year-old Rudi Voller, star of 1986, to come
on.
Key Game: Bolivia v South Korea (June 23 - Boston)
This match offers both countries their chance of a first-ever place in the
second round. This the third successive appearance for the South Koreans in
the World Cup yet they remain largely ignored. North Korea beat Italy 1-0 in
1966 to reach the quarterfinals. In 1986 South Korea held Bulgaria 1-1 and
then terrified Italy, the eventual winners, before losing 3-2. Bolivia have
played three matches in the World Cup finals, scored none and conceded 16.
Both teams have talent and could scare the bigger, stronger but rather
lacklustre German and Spanish teams but this is their best chance of gaining
their first ever win and with it the three points now on offer for a
first-round victory. That should be enough to a place in the second round as
one of the four best third-place teams. -
Bolivia's hope: Marco Antonio Etchverry
