Question: If a woman has a genital herpes infection, does that mean she is more likely to get genital cancer? 
Answer: Infection with the herpes simplex virus does appear to be associated with the development of genital cancer in women; however, this does not necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship between the two events. Some authorities attribute the development of genital cancer in these women to the risk of frequent sexual activity.
