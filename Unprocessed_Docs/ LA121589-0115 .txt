New Zealand's Mercury Bay Boating Club, objecting to San Diego's use of a catamaran in last year's America's Cup defense, filed an opening brief with the New York Court of Appeals to overturn a lower court's ruling returning the sailing prize to the San Diego Yacht Club. 
San Diego is scheduled to respond Jan. 12, followed by Mercury Bay's reply brief Jan. 22 and oral arguments Feb. 8.
