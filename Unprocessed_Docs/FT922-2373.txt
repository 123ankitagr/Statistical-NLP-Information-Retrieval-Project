Australia's ruling Labor party yesterday suffered another political blow
with the arrest of Mr Brian Burke, the former Western Australia premier, for
alleged misuse of parliamentary expense accounts, writes Emilia Tagaza in
Canberra.
The arrest comes only months after the laying of corruption charges against
another West Australian Labor figure, the former deputy premier, Mr David
Parker.
Mr Burke, until recently Australia's ambassador to Ireland, was arrested in
Perth by detectives from the Western Australian official corruption task
force. He faces five charges alleging that he obtained more than ADollars
17,000 (Pounds 7,000) from the parliamentary members' special travel account
through false pretences. He was released on ADollars 20,000 bail.
