Silitek Corp., a Taiwanese semiconductor company, acquired 25.3% of Diodes Inc. and said it might seek control of the Chatsworth maker of semiconductor products. 
In a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Silitek said it bought the 945,800 common shares from Microsemi Corp. for $1.75 a share, or $1.66 million. Microsemi, a Santa Ana electronics concern, had previously announced selling the stock but had not identified the buyer. 
Silitek said that it requested two seats on Diodes' board of directors, and that it is negotiating with Diodes to buy an additional 2 million of its shares.
