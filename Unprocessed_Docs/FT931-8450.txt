A STRIKE planned for next week by thousands of Peugeot Talbot workers in the
UK was deferred last night when union leaders decided to hold a fresh ballot
after claiming that they had won improvements on job security.
Unions said Peugeot Talbot had agreed not to make enforced redundancies and
officials decided the improvement should be put to the workforce in ballots
next Monday and Tuesday.
The company refused to improve a two-year offer of 3.5 per cent on pay now
and 3.5 per cent or the rate of inflation next year.
Shop stewards will hold meetings with workers tomorrow before the balloting
goes ahead.
