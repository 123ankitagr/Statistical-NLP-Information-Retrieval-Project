Speed skater Nick Thometz, who a year ago during the U.S. Olympic trials was battling a blood disorder that sapped his strength, is healthy again. 
Thometz, of Minnetonka, Minn., won the U.S. International Speedskating Assn. sprint title Saturday by winning at 1,000 meters and taking second at 500 meters at Milwaukee. 
During Friday's first day of competition, he won at 500 meters and was second in the 1,000. 
Thometz will be joined on the 4-man U.S. men's team for the World Sprint Championships Feb. 25-26 at Heerenveen, the Netherlands, by Olympic silver medalist Eric Flaim, defending world sprint champion Dan Jansen and Olympian David Cruikshank. 
The women's team will be headed by Olympic gold medalist Bonnie Blair, who won both of her 500 meter and 1,000 meter races Friday and Saturday at the Wisconsin Olympic Rink. 
Blair, the world record holder and Olympic champion at 500 meters, won the 500 Saturday in 41.24 seconds and the 1,000 in 1:25.06. 
Tara Laszlo of St. Paul, Minn., Mary Docter of Madison, Wis., and Peggy Clasen of Roseville, Minn., also qualified for the team.
