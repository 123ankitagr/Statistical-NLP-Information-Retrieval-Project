Having known John Etter for some time, as well as having served on a Neighborhood Council Executive Board with him, I have observed many of his special attributes which the Simi Valley City Council desperately needs now. 
Above all, in my view, Etter maintains exemplary standards regarding environmental issues. He holds the environment in the highest regard, whether the issues are tree preservation, hillside protection, natural flood control or just plain aesthetics. 
These issues deserve the highest priority now more than ever, and they need a clear voice on City Council. And Etter, like no other City Council candidate, gives them the high priority and diligence that they deserve.
