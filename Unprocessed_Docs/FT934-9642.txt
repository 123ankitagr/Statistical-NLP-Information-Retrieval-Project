Blood products from a second German company, Haemoplas, have been recalled
from 64 hospitals because of suspicions that the products may contain the
HIV virus that causes Aids, writes Ariane Genillard in Bonn. Meanwhile, the
state prosecutor's office in Koblenz said it had found two HIV-infected
blood samples among the 2,000 tested so far from UB Plasma, the company that
caused nationwide panic after it revealed it had not properly tested its
blood products.
