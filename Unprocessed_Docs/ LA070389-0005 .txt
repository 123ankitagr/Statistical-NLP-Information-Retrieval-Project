While China slaughters its children and freedom seekers, where is the hastily-called United Nations session to condemn the terrorism and inhumanity, as with Israel? Where are the demonstrations demanding a withdrawal of all investments, as with South Africa? Where is the Administration's fanatic dedication to overthrowing communists in favor of freedom fighter, as we have been doing in Nicaragua? 
Where are the marching liberals, civil rights activists? Why the thunderous silence? 
Is it just that the victims are yellow, not black? Or that a communist nation is the barbaric terrorist? Or that it is a large nation? 
Or, God forbid, because, for a morally-bankrupt government and a hypocritical American population, a concern for profits comes first?
