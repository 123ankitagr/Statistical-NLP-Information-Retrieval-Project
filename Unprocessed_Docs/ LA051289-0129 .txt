Dallas Cowboys quarterback Danny White said Thursday that he has agreed in principle to sign a new contract but won't do so until after the conclusion of the club's "quarterback school." 
The training session for Cowboy quarterbacks, including Troy Aikman, the No. 1 draft choice from UCLA, begins Monday and runs through June 2. 
Meanwhile, there has been no progress in negotiations with unsigned quarterback Steve Pelluer, according to new Cowboy Coach Jimmy Johnson. 
White, who negotiated for himself, told the Dallas Times Herald that reports he will accept a contract with a base salary of less than $300,000 and lucrative performance incentives were inaccurate. 
"These people are good businessmen," White said of the Cowboys' new management. "They are being fair." 
White had been scheduled to earn $605,000 during what was to be his option year in 1989.
