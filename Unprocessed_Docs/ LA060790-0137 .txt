Ailing superstar Michael Jackson is suffering from an inflammation of the rib cage, but was expected to be released from the hospital within two days to continue his recovery at home, his publicist said Wednesday. 
The 31-year-old Grammy-winning singer underwent extensive testing at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica after entering the emergency room Sunday with chest pains. 
Bob Jones, spokesman for the singer, said Jackson was diagnosed as having costochondritis, a condition that results in cartilage inflammation of the front part of the ribs. It can be caused by overexertion and stress, he said. 
Jackson should be back to work within seven to 10 days, Jones said.
