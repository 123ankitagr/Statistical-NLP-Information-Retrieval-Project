Positive news emanating from Cable and Wireless (C&W) was said to be behind
two profit upgrades by brokers yesterday, sending the shares sharply
forward. BZW raised its 1993 forecast by Pounds 15m to Pounds 810m, and a
further Pounds 20m to Pounds 990m the year after. One other leading broker
also raised its forecasts, according to dealers.
C&W has been reporting increased interest among new domestic and business
subscribers for Mercury telephone system users, with the number of new
customers estimated by analysts to have risen by about 30 per cent a month
in the group's second half. Mercury's aim to have two million customers by
the middle of 1995 is now within range, according to telecoms specialists.
That trend is likely to accelerate when Mercury introduces its 'Easy Access'
system in April, allowing subscribers to use Mercury from telephones without
the special blue Mercury button. C&W shares advanced 20 to 725p in turnover
of 2.8m.
