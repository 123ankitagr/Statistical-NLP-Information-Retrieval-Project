The Bluff Road bridge in Montebello, a turn-of-the century timber bridge that was destroyed when a firecracker ignited it in July, 1989, will be reopened next week after nine months of work. 
A two-lane concrete bridge with a pedestrian walkway will replace the old timber bridge that once crossed the Union Pacific railroad tracks beside the Rio Hondo south of Whittier Boulevard, said Joan Caterino, Montebello community relations assistant. 
Caterino said the $1.7-million project was paid for with city and federal funds.
