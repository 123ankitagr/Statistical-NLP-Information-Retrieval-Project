Federal officials have fined Johnson City $6,000 for removing catalytic converters from police cruisers in a bid to protect police dogs' sense of smell. 
The smell of the anti-pollution devices temporarily deadens the dogs' sniffing power, police dog handlers say. Law-enforcement officials say they may need those minutes when tracking a suspect. 
A city official two years ago authorized removing catalytic converters from cruisers transporting police dogs. But the Environmental Protection Agency found out about it and fined the city $6,000. 
City Manager John Campbell said Wednesday that the city may appeal. He said the city otherwise has had a good compliance record with the Clean Air Act.
