President Boris Yeltsin has signed a decree to force Russian enterprises to
settle debts incurred between themselves, it was announced yesterday, writes
Leyla Boulton from Moscow.
The decree provides for the issue of promissory notes which would enable
creditors to sell enterprises' debts to other companies if they remained
unpaid. The holders of such debts could then try to recover them by starting
bankruptcy proceedings against the indebted enterprise.
With inflation very high and enterprises prepared to deliver goods to each
other without payment, many have found it not only more profitable, but
possible, to drag out payment indefinitely.
