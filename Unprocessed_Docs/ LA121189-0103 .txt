Joe Cloutier, president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, died today at his home. He was 81. 
Cloutier, Speedway vice president since Tony Hulman purchased the decaying track at the end of World War II, was named president when Hulman died in 1977. He stepped down when John Cooper was appointed president in 1980 and was named president again when Cooper resigned two years later. 
Cloutier began his association with the Hulman family as a cashier with its wholesale grocery business in 1926. He advanced to assistant treasurer with the company and stayed with Hulman when he bought the Speedway in 1945 from Eddie Rickenbacker, the World War I flying ace and then president of American Airlines.
