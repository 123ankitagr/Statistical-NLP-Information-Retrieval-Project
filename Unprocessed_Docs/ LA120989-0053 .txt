AMR Close to Buying Some Eastern Routes: AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, is close to striking an agreement to buy Eastern Airlines' profitable Latin American routes for between $300 million and $400 million, an industry source said. "It is very close," said the source, who asked not to be identified. Officials at Eastern, a subsidiary of Texas Air Corp., and at American declined to comment. Two weeks ago, however, American officials confirmed that the two airlines had held discussions about the sale of the Latin routes for several months and that talks had resumed in early November.
