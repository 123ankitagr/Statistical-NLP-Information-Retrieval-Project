ITV, which lost coverage of the Premier League to British Sky Broadcasting,
yesterday announced a multi-million-pound deal to show exclusive live
coverage of the group stages of the European Champions Cup.
ITV plans to cover six games live and show highlights from others. There is
also an agreement to show Leeds United's first two rounds.
No value was placed on yesterday's deal, but it is believed to be worth
about Pounds 5m.
