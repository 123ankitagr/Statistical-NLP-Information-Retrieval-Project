A 96-year-old man trying to improve his TV reception by adjusting an antenna atop his apartment building fell 17 stories to his death, police said today. 
Sam Lifshutz "had bad reception on his television and had complained before to maintenance," said Officer Jeff Humphrey. "Apparently he wanted to fix it." The man fell 150 feet, hitting a lower-level roof on the way down.
