"LARKS ON A STRING"(Czechoslovakia, 1969; Director: Jiri Menzel; Fairfax, 8:45 p.m.). The most famous banned film in the Hollywood Glasnost section, "Larks" surfaced after two decades to share the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. I prefer it to his 1966 Oscar-winner, "Closely Watched Trains." Deceptively light and sunny, buoyant and dangerously lyrical, it's a romantic comedy about a group of bourgeois Czechs and their postwar political re-education in a wildly picturesque scrapheap. It's a movie that sings. (Michael Wilmington)
