China expects to conduct 'a few more' nuclear tests before it joins an
international moratorium on experimental atomic blasts, an official said
yesterday. Beijing has said it favours a complete ban on all nuclear arms,
but until a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty is concluded, will refuse
to join in a two-year-old moratorium adopted by the world's other declared
nuclear powers. The official said his government did not want to see the
nuclear weapons gap between China and other nuclear powers 'frozen forever',
leaving Beijing vulnerable to attack. More tests were needed to improve the
quality of new devices.
