CENTRAL EUROPEAN countries' attempts to ban imports of livestock and dairy
products from the European Community were condemned as 'unacceptable'
yesterday by Mr Rene Steichen, the EC's agriculture commissioner.
The community last week imposed a one-month ban on imports of live animals,
meat, milk and dairy products from 18 central and east European countries
following the discovery of foot-and-mouth disease in Italy, allegedly spread
from Croatian imports.
Mr Steichen told his fellow commissioners yesterday that restrictions
imposed by certain central European countries - including Poland, Hungary,
Bulgaria, Slovakia and the Czech republic - amounted to an unacceptable
political reaction to what was essentially a veterinary matter.
Hungary promptly denied that the imposition of restrictions on EC imports
was retaliation for the community ban, arguing that foot-and-mouth disease
was still present on EC territory.
EC veterinary experts, who meet on April 20 to review the ban, are satisfied
that foot-and-mouth disease has been eradicated in some ex-communist
countries.
But a commission official said yesterday that the EC was worried about east
and central European controls on exports. Fears were aroused when 200 out of
450 Czech and Slovak cattle imported into Britain were found to have been
vaccinated against foot-and-mouth disease.
Vaccinated animals cannot be exported, in case they develop the disease
itself. The British imports arrived with false certificates giving them a
clear bill of health.
Commission officials said that the veterinary certificates could have been
falsified as many as three times as the cattle were transported across
eastern Europe.
