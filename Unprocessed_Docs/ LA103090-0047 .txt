Superior Industries International Inc. in Van Nuys said it formed a joint venture company with Topy Industries Ltd. of Japan to sell cast aluminum wheels to Japanese customers. 
Superior is a major manufacturer of wheels and other auto accessories for U.S. auto makers, and Topy is Japan's largest wheel producer. Their new venture, Topy-Superior Ltd., is half-owned by each company and "is a key step in our international marketing efforts," Superior Chairman Louis L. Borick said in a statement. 
Topy-Superior's wheels will be shipped to Japan and to Japanese auto makers operating in the United States, the companies said.
