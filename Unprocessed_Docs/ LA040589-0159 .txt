All-America baseball player John Olerud of Washington State University has returned to practice for the first time since undergoing surgery in late February for an aneurysm at the base of his brain. 
Olerud, a junior pitcher and first-baseman, took hitting practice with the team Tuesday and did some light conditioning. He is seeking to regain the form that earned him Player of the Year honors from Baseball America magazine last season, when he compiled a 15-0 pitching record and led WSU in hitting with a .464 average. 
Olerud might be back in action later this collegiate season, which ends in late May, but realistically said he hopes to be ready for the summer league.
