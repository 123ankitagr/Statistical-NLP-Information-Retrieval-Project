SEVEN people were killed yesterday in fighting around Bosanski Brod, a
strategic town on Bosnia-Hercegovina's frontier with Croatia, despite a UN
plea to halt the con-flict.
Radio Sarajevo said more than 1,000 grenades hit Bosanski Brod, a mixed town
of mostly Serbs and Croats.
The town's crisis centre yesterday appealed for the despatch of UN
peacekeepers 'to prevent the town from total destruction.'
At the same time, Bosnia's Moslem leaders yesterday appeared to go back on
an agreement brokered last week by the European Community among the leaders
of Bosnia's national parties to divide the central republic into three
separate areas which would give Moslems, Serbs and Croats local autonomy.
Kerin Hope in Athens adds: Mr Constantine Karamanlis, the Greek president,
yesterday reiterated the government's unwillingness to recognise the
Yugoslav republic of Macedonia.
