In Hong Kong, a daily 10-minute traffic jam could be costing the British
colony huge sums, Hang Seng Bank has calculated.  'If the time spent in
traffic congestion (were) put to productive use, a 10-minute daily delay for
each worker would equal 124m working hours for the whole economy,' it said. Translated into money terms, this would imply an additional output of
HKDollars 18bn (Dollars 2.3bn).
Traffic conditions have deteriorated sharply in Hong Kong, with car
ownership outstripping road construction.  And rapid expansion of trade with
China has boosted freight and passenger movements across the border.
