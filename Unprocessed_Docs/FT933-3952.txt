BRIERLEY Investments reports an 8 per cent increase in net profit to
NZDollars 271.3m (USDollars 149.8m) for the year ended June, despite
continued weak trading by its UK hotels arm.
Mr Bob Matthew, chairman, said that the result was satisfactory given that
around one-third of the parent company's total assets, its 70 per cent
interest in the Mount Charlotte UK group, did little better than break even.
In the past two months, however, Mount Charlotte hotels had recorded a
marked improvement in occupancies, and directors were confident the recovery
was under way.
The New Zealand division recorded earnings of NZDollars 245m, up from
NZDollars 154m. Earnings from Australia were NZDollars 57m, compared with a
loss of NZDollars 33m last time. The newly created US arm, which had
budgeted for a small profit, made a loss of NZDollars 11.6m.
Earnings from the UK were NZDollars 5m, down from NZDollars 116m last year
when the Tozer Kemsley motor group, subsequently sold, was included. The
major associates Air New Zealand and Carter Holt Harvey recorded good
profits.
Earnings from New Zealand in the coming year would be boosted by the
purchase of fishing group Sealord, although this would be offset from the
loss of profits from interests in New Zealand companies that had been sold.
