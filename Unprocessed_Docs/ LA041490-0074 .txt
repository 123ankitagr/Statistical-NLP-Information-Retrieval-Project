Hundreds of radical students demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops fought riot police with firebombs in the provincial city of Taejon, news reports said. 
The protests were fueled by rumors that the U.S. Army would move its South Korean headquarters from Seoul, the capital, to Taejon. "Expel U.S. soldiers!" about 1,000 students yelled as they marched from Chungnam University, according to Yonhap, the South Korean news agency. Police fired tear gas to break up the protest. About 800 students at Taejon's Gongju University also fought police to demand a U.S. pullout, Yonhap said.
