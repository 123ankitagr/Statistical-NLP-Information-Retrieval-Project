The percentage of donated blood in Orange County that must be destroyed has been climbing and reached 8% last year, according to the American Red Cross. Blood is destroyed if it is "reactive" or out of date -- more than 42 days old. 
Reactive blood has not necessarily been tainted by AIDS. Red Cross technicians also, for example, test blood for reaction to alanine amino transferase (ALT), which is a liver enzyme. The presence of ALT is often an indicator of liver disease. However, positive reactions can also be produced by the donor having consumed one beer the night before, or by taking four Tylenol tablets the day of the donation. Thus, one doesn't have to have liver disease to test positive for ALT. However, the donated blood will be destroyed as a matter of precaution. 
A total of 14 tests take lab workers up to nine hours to complete. Also, during the screening process, donors have several opportunities to confidentially self-exclude their donated blood.
