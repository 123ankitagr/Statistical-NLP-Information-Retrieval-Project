A group of Chumash Indians meeting Sunday night voted to recommend that a proposed new wilderness area in north Ventura County be named the Chumash Wilderness Area. 
Patrick Tumamait, who organized the meeting, attended by about 40 people, said he prefers the name Chumash over other suggestions because it would increase the tribe's visibility. 
The meeting, held at the Washington School auditorium in Ventura, was called to recommend a Chumash name for the wilderness, which includes a number of sites with historical or spiritual significance to the tribe. 
Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura) said last week that he would seek to get the name chosen by the Chumash approved if the wilderness bill, now stalled in the Senate, passes.
