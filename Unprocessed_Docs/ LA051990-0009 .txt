Our politicians are saddling the future generations with a tremendous burden of national debts. 
Yet, the word "tax" frightens many including President Bush. I am sick of reading his twisted lips. 
Now, for a change, Mr. President, read my lips "we need new taxes." Forget the voodoo economics and balance the budget. I hate paying more taxes, but am willing to do my share. Got the message, Mr. President?
