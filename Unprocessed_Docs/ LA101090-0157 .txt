Former Mayor Jane Byrne says she will attempt a comeback in 1991 and already is circulating nominating petitions. 
"We are absolutely having no difficulty getting signatures," she said Tuesday. 
Byrne was elected mayor in 1979 and lost a reelection bid in the 1983 Democratic primary to Harold Washington, who went on to become the city's first black mayor. 
She lost a comeback bid to Washington in the 1987 primary. 
Mayor Richard M. Daley, elected in 1989 after Washington died in office, is expected to seek a full four-year term in 1991. 
"Anybody can run for mayor," Daley said when asked about Byrne's decision.
