Haiti's army-installed president named himself prime minister yesterday,
hours after Mr Robert Malval, the premier named by ousted President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, ordered government workers to ignore orders from the
military regime, Associated Press reports from Port-au-Prince. Mr Emile
Jonassaint, 81, issued the declaration in defiance of US growing pressure to
restore Mr Aristide to power.  President Bill Clinton has not ruled out
using military force to reinstall Mr Aristide, Haiti's first freely elected
leader, who was deposed in a bloody coup in 1991.
