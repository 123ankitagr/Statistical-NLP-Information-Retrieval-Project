THE BUNDESBANK has been criticised by the chief economist of Germany's
largest commercial bank for relying on 'unsuitable indicators' in the
pursuit of its monetary policies, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
Speaking a week after what he called the 'de facto suspension' of the
European monetary system, Mr Norbert Walter of Deutsche Bank said M3, the
broad money supply indicator targeted by the central bank, was obviously
distorted and devalued as an indicator.
Yet the Bundesbank still used M3 as a basis for its policies, he said in a
newspaper interview. He also charged the Bundesbank with forgetting its own
analysis when using inflation rates as an argument for its actions. This
showed monetary policy took two-and-a-half years to influence prices.
Moreover, the inflation rate was over-stated as a result of the many rises
in indirect taxes. German inflation exceeds 4 per cent a year and M3 has
been growing at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent; these are above the
levels desired by the Bundesbank, which had thus been reluctant to speed up
interest rate cuts. However, Mr Walter did not blame the bank's high
interest rates for curbing economic growth in Europe. 'Inflation,
unemployment and the budgetary strains resulting from these are mainly
caused by erroneous economic and wage policies,' he said.
