PEUGEOT TALBOT will be seen to have made an 'acceptable' level of profit
last year when the depressed state of the car market is taken into account,
Mr Geoffrey Whalen, managing director of the UK subsidiary of the French
group, said yesterday.
He said the UK car industry would undergo a modest revival this year after
hitting 'rock-bottom' in December.
Mr Whalen declined to comment on the size of last year's profit made by
Peugeot Talbot. It is expected to be less than half of 1990's pre-tax profit
of Pounds 109m. The 1990 figure was, however, the company's second-best
result since Peugeot took over the loss-making UK operations of Chrysler
(formerly Rootes group) in 1978.
Among the rest of the UK's main carmakers, Mr Bill Ebbert, chairman of
Vauxhall, has also said that the General Motors subsidiary 'will definitely
stay in profit'.
This is in contrast to Ford, which has warned that its financial performance
last year would be 'far worse' than the pre-tax loss of Pounds 274m incurred
in 1990.
Rover Group, the British Aerospace subsidiary, showed a Pounds 45m trading
loss in the first half of last year, compared with a Pounds 33m profit in
the same period of 1990.
Work is continuing at Peugeot Talbot's manufacturing facility at Ryton, near
Coventry, on additional facilities to build a second range of cars from
early next year. Currently it builds only the 405 car.
In spite of exporting nearly 60,000 Ryton-built 405s to Continental markets
last year, the depressed state of the UK market meant that the company was
unably to prevent total output falling to 87,000, from 116,500 a year
earlier.
