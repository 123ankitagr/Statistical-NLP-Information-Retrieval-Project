New light is shed on the reasons for a series of sinkings among dry bulk
carriers during the late-1980s and early-1990s, in a report* published
recently, Charles Batchelor, Transport Correspondent, writes from London.
A total of 64 dry bulk carriers and ore/bulk/oil carriers (OBOs) were lost
in the three years from 1991-1993, prompting concerns about the way dry bulk
vessels, which typically carry iron ore or coal, were built and the advanced
age of the fleet.
But many of the losses were of OBOs, which can carry either dry bulk or oil
as cargo, while navigational error was a more important reason for loss than
structural or engineering problems, according to a new study by Intercargo,
the International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners.
OBOs are often much larger than dry bulk carriers and are subdivided into
separate tanks for oil, which makes them more difficult to sink. But they
are more vulnerable to explosions, difficult to maintain and more prone to
corrosion. In 1992 the loss of nine OBOs disguised a sharp fall in dry bulk
losses to 20 from 28 the previous year.
