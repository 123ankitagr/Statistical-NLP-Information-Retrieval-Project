SENIOR US and North Korean officials held seven hours of talks in Geneva
yesterday in a second attempt to head off confrontation over Pyongyang's
refusal to allow international inspection of suspect nuclear sites.
Mr Robert Gallucci, US assistant secretary of state, called the talks
'useful'. Mr Kang Sok-ju, North Korea's first vice-minister for foreign
affairs, said they had been 'intensive, productive and useful.' The two
sides meet again tomorrow.
Yesterday's was the second encounter over the issue following Pyongyang's
decision in March to withdraw from the 1968 nuclear non-proliferation
treaty. At talks in New York in June, North Korea agreed to suspend its
decision but refuses to give International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors
access to the suspect sites.
The IAEA believes that North Korea may be storing plutonium that could be
used to make nuclear weapons without declaring it to the agency as required
by the non-proliferation treaty rules.
North Korea denies this but has refused access to two buildings close to its
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon, 95km north of Pyongyang, where the IAEA
believes the plutonium may be stored.
The US and North Korea last month pledged not to start nuclear war and
voiced support for a nuclear-free Korean peninsular, impartial application
of IAEA safeguards, non-interference in each other's internal affairs and
the peaceful reunification of Korea.
This week's talks centre on what would constitute 'impartial' inspections.
North Korea has claimed that the IAEA is biased in favour of the western
powers, and the US has threatened to seek United Nations sanctions against
North Korea if the talks fail. President Bill Clinton warned last weekend
that, if North Korea ever used nuclear arms, it 'would be the end of their
country'.
