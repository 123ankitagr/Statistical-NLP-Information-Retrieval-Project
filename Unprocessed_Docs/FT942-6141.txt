Do you have a pc at home? Does it have windows? Or a mouse? Have you bought
an electronic notebook to replace that antiquated laptop? There is, we are
told, an increasingly significant split between those who are computer
literate and those who are not. It is said to be as important as the gap
dividing those who can read and those who cannot. But there is another
group, which is also expanding: those of us who find ourselves using
computers, willy nilly, though we still do not properly understand them, or
like them very much. We must constitute an ideal audience for The Net,
BBC2's series which deals with computers in much the same way that 'Top
Gear' deals with cars. Today (8.00) they consider the symbiotic relationship
between those who create computer viruses and those who write anti-viral
software. If you would prefer to be taken out of yourself with very
straightforward enter tainment, Sharpe is a blood and thunder series
starring Sean Bean as an officer in Wellington's army during the Napoleonic
wars (ITV 8.00). BBC2 repeats Safe, a drama about homeless teenagers in
London (9.00).
