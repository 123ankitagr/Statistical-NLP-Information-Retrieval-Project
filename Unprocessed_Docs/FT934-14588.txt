CHINA'S largest steelmaker, Anshan Iron and Steel Complex (Angang), has
signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Portman Mining to develop
an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing in Western Australia.
Koolyanobbing was closed by Broken Hill Proprietary in 1982, but the aim is
to redevelop the mine by July next year. Angang will buy all the iron ore
fines produced at Koolyanobbing - which are estimated to average around 1.1m
tonnes a year - for the next 20 years.
The joint venture will take over low-grade stockpiles left behind when BHP
closed its iron ore operations on Cockatoo Island, off northern Western
Australia. Angang will also buy the concentrate from Cockatoo Island for the
six years of this project.
Total annual sales for the joint venture - including those to Angang - are
forecast to be ADollars 50m (USDollars 33.13m) a year.
Investment in the joint venture project itself will be around ADollars 25m,
although the two parties said that there would be further 'substantial'
expenditure by plant and equipment contractors and by the Esperance Port
Authority on shiploading facilities.
Portman will hold a 60 per cent interest in the joint venture, and Angang
the rest.
