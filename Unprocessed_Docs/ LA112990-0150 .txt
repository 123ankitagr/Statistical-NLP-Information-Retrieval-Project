County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez presented an $8,500 grant to the North Orange County YMCA on Wednesday to help subsidize its child-care center. 
Money from the grant will be used to help pay the five day-care attendants who work at the center at 1414 S. Brookhurst St. The center provides care for about 25 children in before- and after-school programs. 
Sue Kaiser, senior program director for North County YMCA, said the grant was very much needed. Kaiser said the center primarily serves children from single-family homes where money is tight and the mother works.
