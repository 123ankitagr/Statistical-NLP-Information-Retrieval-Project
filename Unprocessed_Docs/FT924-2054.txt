Sir, David Cannadine's article about the Royal dilemma rightly stressed
constitutional implications, but was incomplete.
Every country, including Britain, needs a head of state. Does anyone
seriously expect a Conservative prime minister to recommend the replacement
of the monarchy by a president? Or can anyone imagine John Smith as prime
minister putting such a proposal to the Commons?
Notwithstanding all the family problems, this show will run and run.
