I was surprised that the recent article on ecological games entirely missed a local source ("Playing Games With Mother Nature," May 2). Animal Town Game Co. in Santa Barbara has been producing and distributing games for more than 10 years, including wonderful board games that require players to cooperate to save the whales or to grow an organic garden. Its catalogue is full of ecological and earth-centered activities not available in stores.
