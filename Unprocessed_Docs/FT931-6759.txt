FIRST American Bankshares, the BCCI-tainted Washington-based bank, has
agreed to sell virtually all of its remaining assets for Dollars 453m in
cash to First Union of North Carolina.
First Union will acquire all of the stock of First American Metro, the
holding company for First American Bank of Virginia, Maryland and Washington
DC.
The agreement comes about eight months after the Federal Reserve Board
ordered the Washington bank be sold after BCCI Holdings pleaded guilty to
illegally controlling First American.
Mr Harry Albright, court-appointed trustee of First American, said: 'Under
this agreement, First American's banking franchise in metropolitan
Washington will be sold intact to a strong banking institution which will
assume all of the deposit liabilities and acquire substantially all of First
American's remaining assets.'
First American Bank of Georgia is in liquidation and First American Miami
will be acquired by AmTrade International Bank of Georgia.
Mr John Georges, president of First Union said 'after so much uncertainty
and so much waiting, First American's future is secure'. First American
itself has not been accused of any wrongdoing.
At the end of 1992, First American Metro had total assets of Dollars 4.6bn
and deposits of Dollars 4bn. The acquisition will make First Union the
eighth biggest US banking group.
