Moody's Investors Service said it had assigned a rating of A2 to the
long-term senior debt guaranteed by investment bank SG Warburg Group, the
first debt rating it has given for the group.
According to Moody's, the rating reflects the group's leading franchises in
the UK and international equities markets, as well as its conservative
financial structure.
However, the rating also reflects expectations that Warburg's competitive
position will be increasingly challenged by other, much larger investment
banks, especially in its overseas markets.
Moody's said that it expected competition for business to be particularly
intense in developing markets, and the size of Warburg's much larger US
competitors would give them powerful advantages.
According to Moody's, 'a second challenge is for Warburg to decide on the
appropriate volume and risk limits of its securities trading'. The agency
noted the volatility which trading on its own capital base has introduced
into earnings.
