Fraud Prompts Court to Appoint Trustee: An independent trustee was appointed to manage 240 acres near Fontana, Calif., after a bankruptcy judge in U.S. District Court in Denver found that the current real estate management company had committed fraud and mismanagement, executives of Kaiser Steel Resources said Thursday. Kaiser is the largest creditor in the estate of Perma Pacific properties, the property owner, and is seeking control of the land. Kaiser had filed suit against Perma Pacific for return of the land, which it claimed Perma Pacific swapped for worthless Colorado real estate in 1985. Perma Pacific could not be reached for comment. (Filed Feb. 6, 1987, Case No. 87E135.)
