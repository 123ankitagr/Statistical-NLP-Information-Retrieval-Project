The International Museum of Photography is honoring the sultry-voiced Lauren Bacall with an award for her illustrious film career. 
Bacall will be given the George Eastman Award "for distinguished achievement in American film" at a fund-raising gala at the George Eastman House on Nov. 9. 
Previous recipients of the award include Gregory Peck, James Stewart and Lillian Gish. 
Bacall, who was born Betty Joan Perske, began her career in the 1940s in the movie "To Have and Have Not" with Humphrey Bogart. Her come-on in that film to Bogart, who became her husband, has become movie legend. 
"If you want anything, just whistle," Bacall's character coyly intones. "You know how to whistle, don't you, Steve? Just put your lips together . . . and blow." 
Bacall starred with Bogart in "The Big Sleep," "Dark Passage" and "Key Largo." In 1970, she won a Tony award for her stage performance in the musical "Applause." More recently she played roles in "Murder on the Orient Express," "The Shootist" and "The Fan."
