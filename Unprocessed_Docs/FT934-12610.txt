Salaries for lawyers working in commerce, finance and industry rose by an
average of 5.8 per cent over the past 12 months, according to a salary
survey of lawyers in industry published by Chambers and Partners,
recruitment consultants. The highest average earnings were for the top 10
per cent of senior legal advisers aged 45 and over, at Pounds 170,189. The
lowest, for the bottom 10 per cent of legal assistants aged 25-29 years, was
Pounds 23,750.
Chambers says recession appears to have hit the banking sector particularly
hard. Lawyers in banking were the second highest paid group in 1992, but
ranked only eighth in 1993. Lawyers in the entertainment industry were the
highest paid in 1993, with an average salary of Pounds 64,520.
