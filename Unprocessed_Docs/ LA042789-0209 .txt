The Food and Drug Administration today approved testing on humans of an experimental AIDS drug derived from the root of a Chinese cucumber plant. 
The plant extract, which is also used in some Chinese herbal medicines, has shown promise in laboratory tests in attacking human disease-fighting cells infected with the AIDS virus, according to recently published research findings. 
The chemical name of the plant extract is trichosanthin. The scientific name of the plant from which it is derived is trichosanthes kirilowii. The highly purified form of the compound undergoing testing for possible use against AIDS is being called GLQ223. 
It is being developed by Genelabs Inc., a closely held biotechnology company in Redwood City, Calif.
