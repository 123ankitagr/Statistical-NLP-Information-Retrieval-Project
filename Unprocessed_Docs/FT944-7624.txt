The rate of growth in German money supply eased more than expected last
month putting it nearer the Bundesbank's 1994 target range after thsteep
rises earlier this year. But the improvement is not expected to prompt the
central bank to lower interest rates at today's council meeting. It said M3
rose at an annualised 6.9 per cent in October after 7.8 per cent in
September. But Mr Richard Reid, UBS economist, said because DM4.3bn went
into money market funds, now allowed in Germany, in October, the M3 figure
'was not as positive as it appeared'.
Germany's budget deficit will be well below target for this year and 1995
because of strong economic growth, Mr Theo Waigel, finance minister said
yesterday. Mr Waigel said the federal budget deficit for 1994 would be about
DM10bn below the forecast DM69.1bn. The 1995 budget deficit will also be
about DM10bn less than forecast.
