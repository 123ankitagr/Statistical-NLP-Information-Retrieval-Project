The US and North Korea yesterday ended 'serious and co-operative' talks in
Pyongyang on setting up liaison offices as a first step to diplomatic
relations. The US is offering improved links in return for North Korea
accepting full international nuclear inspections and stopping its nuclear
programme.
The discussions in Pyongyang, which began on Saturday, have focused on
technical matters such as selecting a location for the US office in North
Korea. A decision on whether to proceed with the offices will come after the
US and North Korea resume high-level talks in Geneva on September 23 to
settle the nuclear dispute.
North Korea allowed International Atomic Energy Agency experts access to a
previously-closed fuel fabrication plant. The US and North Korea meet in
Berlin this week to discuss ways to deprive Pyongyang of the ability to
produce weapons-grade plutonium.
