A: A white organza shawl would be a simple-to-make, safe choice. But if you're willing to be a little daring, how about wearing an oversized white organza shirt? Londoner Rifat Ozbek designed one with kimono sleeves. You can approximate the look with Vogue Pattern 7727 (illustrated here). It has French cuffs, but essentially it's the same. MARYLOU LUTHER
