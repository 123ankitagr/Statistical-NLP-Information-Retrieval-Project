MR IAN LANG, the Scottish secretary, was yesterday urged by Labour to
confirm that Scottish Enterprise, the official development body, still has a
long-term future. This follows an announcement by Scottish Enterprise that
it plans to make 60 of its 380 headquarters staff redundant.
Scottish Enterprise stressed that the redundancies, which it hopes will be
voluntary, did not result from financial stringency but from a desire to
'refocus' its activities and improve efficiency. Its budget for the next
financial year is virtually unchanged at Pounds 455m.
The headquarters in Glasgow funds the network of 13 local enterprise
companies in southern Scotland, carries out Scotland-wide functions and
helps selected sectors of the economy.
Mr Crawford Beveridge, Scottish Enterprise chief executive, said the
organisation would continue to focus on attracting inward investment,
assisting indigenous investment, helping selected sectors and developing
exports.
The enterprise companies are expected to reduce their administrative budgets
next year, Scottish Enterprise said. Recently Mr Lang told Scottish
Enterprise he wanted to see more decentralisation to the companies.
Scottish Enterprise was unable to name any sector of its activities that
would be discontinued, although it is believed that help to industrial
sectors which already have a strong trade association may be ended.
Mr Henry McLeish, acting shadow Scottish secretary, said the job losses were
'a disgrace which confirm our fears about the future of Scottish
Enterprise'.
