The article "Drawing a Bead on Hunting" (Part I, Aug. 28) would lead readers to believe that the current effort to save the mountain lion is an anti-hunting campaign. Such is not the case. The California Wildlife Initiative, if passed by the voters in 1990, will not stop all hunting and is not intended to do so. 
The number of mountain lions left in California is unknown. No scientific study has been made to determine the number of these creatures left in our state. Until such a study is made it would seem prudent to stop the hunting of mountain lions. 
Even so, the initiative has provisions for the taking of lions which endanger people or kill rancher's livestock.
