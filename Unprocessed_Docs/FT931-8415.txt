Perhaps the most irritating thing about watching feature films which have
been recorded on home video is the adverts which pop up at the most exciting
part of the action. Now US viewers can skip the commercials by shouting 'zap
it'.
The VCR voice programmer, developed by Voice Powered Technology, of Canoga
Park, California, also enables viewers to switch their video on and off and
program it simply by speaking commands.
The device, the size of an ordinary television remote control unit, can also
be used instead of the conventional remote control to operate the television
and cable box.
The company is planning to develop the gadget, which costs Dollars 169
(Pounds 119), for sale in Europe and the Far East. Voice Powered Technology:
