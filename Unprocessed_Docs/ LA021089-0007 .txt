In his column, Danziger rebukes colleges and universities for encouraging insincerity in the youth of America when they write their college application essays. 
Danziger muses, "What would happen if someone just wrote what he or she was thinking?" Well, here's the start of an essay that's not at all phony, one that Danziger might like.  "If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth."  Holden lives! But, then again, he never did do well in school.
