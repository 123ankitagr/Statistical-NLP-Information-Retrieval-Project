The Thousand Oaks city clerk has been presented the highest state award in her field because of her longtime service to the city, local officials said. 
At a recent meeting in San Diego, Nancy Dillon was given the City Clerk of the Year award of the City Clerks Assn. of California. 
She was nominated by a group of her peers and selected by the president of the association. 
In 1988, Dillon received the association's Award of Distinction for a handbook that she designed that described the functions of Thousand Oaks city government to residents. 
Dillon, who has served on the executive board of the state City Clerks Assn., joined the Thousand Oaks staff in 1976 as a clerk. She also served as executive assistant to the city manager before being named city clerk in 1982. 
Some of her responsibilities include conducting city elections, overseeing city records, maintaining the city archives and updating municipal codes and ordinances. She also coordinates more than 35 council-appointed citizen committees. 
"I'm still stunned by the honor and surprised," Dillon said. TINA DAUNT
