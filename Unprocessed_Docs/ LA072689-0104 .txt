Ex-Officers of Sea World Plan Bid: Three former Sea World executives said they plan to submit an offer to buy four Sea Worlds and two other amusement parks that were put up for sale last month by parent Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. Former executives Jan Schultz, Robert Hillebrecht and George Millay declined to say how much their offer will be, but analysts have estimated that the six parks plus 1,200 acres of raw land could fetch $1.4 billion to $2 billion.
