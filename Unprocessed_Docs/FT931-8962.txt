ANY proposal to have President Bill Clinton appear before the US House of
Representatives to answer questions in the British parliamentary tradition
would require further study, US congressional leaders said yesterday,
Reuters reports from Washington.
House Speaker Thomas Foley told reporters there would be no invitation for
such an appearance this week following Mr Clinton's address to a joint
session of Congress on the economy tonight.
The idea was suggested by Mr Richard Gephardt of Missouri, House majority
leader, who said Mr Clinton should visit the House and answer questions
about his economic programme.
But Mr Foley said the unprecedented step was an idea for the future that
'requires further study and analysis'. He said Mr Gephardt concurred with
this position.
The White House has said Mr Clinton was considering the idea.
