I read with interest Itabari Njeri's article on racial relations ("An L.A. Cultural Crucible," May 2). 
I noted that the author used the term "Euro-American" when referring to whites rather than the inaccurate and possibly derogatory term "Anglo" used often. 
While "Euro-American" seemed initially unfamiliar and awkward, as one of Greek-American descent I much prefer this term if I must be classified racially. Although "Euro-American" still leaves room for misrepresentation (white people of Middle-Eastern descent among others are still mischaracterized), I feel The Times should encourage the use of this term, which more accurately allows for the ethnic diversity among the white residents of Los Angeles than does the Latinocentric term "Anglo."
