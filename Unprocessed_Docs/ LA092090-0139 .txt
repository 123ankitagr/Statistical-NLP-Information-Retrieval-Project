With one member absent Tuesday night, the Compton City Council decided to put off a decision on whether to raise residential trash collection rates. Mayor Walker R. Tucker has been ill and unable to attend council meetings this month. 
The city's trash hauler, Murcole Inc., is seeking a rate increase of 17.16%. That would push the current monthly rate from $11.32 per residence to $13.26. 
The city staff told the council in a memo that the request is excessive because the consumer price index has risen only 4.9% and dumping fees at landfills have not gone up enough to justify such a high rate hike. 
The city staff is recommending that the rate be raised to $11.94, which would be a 5.5% increase. The council is scheduled to take up the issue again at its meeting next Tuesday.
