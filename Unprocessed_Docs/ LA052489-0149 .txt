Spurred by brisk domestic demand, Japan's production of motor vehicles in April hit a monthly record of 1,091,977 units, up 1.4% over a year ago, the Japan Automobile Manufacturers' Assn. reported today. 
The association said domestic sales grew 6.2% to 569,797 units, a record for any April. Exports decreased about 10% because of sluggish demand overseas, coupled with the yen's appreciation, the association said. 
Introduction in April of a lower sales tax, replacing the higher commodity levy, was responsible for brisk sales, association officials said. The uniform 6% tax on car sales replaced the commodity tax, which had ranged from 18.5% to 23%.
