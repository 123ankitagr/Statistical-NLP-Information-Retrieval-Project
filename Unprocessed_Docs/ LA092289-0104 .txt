An air force helicopter on a rescue mission off the hurricane-ravaged French island of Guadeloupe crashed into the ocean, killing six people and leaving three others missing, military officials said Thursday. 
The helicopter crashed Wednesday night off the island of Desirade, about 22 miles east of the French-held main island of Guadeloupe. 
The helicopter had been evacuating Bertrand Berchel, a Desirade resident who injured his head when he fell from his roof while repairing damage caused by Hurricane Hugo. Berchel was being evacuated along with his son, Bernard.
