Actress Angie Dickinson, who has shed a drop or two of perspiration under studio lights, testified on behalf of a man who claims that GTE Products Corp. stole his secret process for a cool studio light. 
Filming with Cool Light "took less time because I could stay in the scenes longer without needing to be repaired," the star of the 1970s TV show "Police Woman" testified Tuesday, the first day of the testimony in the federal court trial. 
She also said the lighting system requires less equipment and is easier to use on locations. 
She testified for George Panagiotou of Los Angeles, who claims that GTE broke an agreement under which he gave the company production secrets for the light. GTE has denied the allegations.
