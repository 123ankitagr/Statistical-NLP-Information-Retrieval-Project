nuclear weapons development and forcing the isolated communist nation to
open to inspections, officials said yesterday, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.

nuclear facilities to gain crucial time for arms development or to move
facilities.

lack of progress in nuclear talks between North and South Korea and urged

south only for inter-Korea talks.
The two-day meeting called by the United Nations Development Programme
starts on Thursday. It will focus on development of the Tuman River area.
South and North Korea, China and Mongolia have been invited to participate.
Russia and Japan will be present as observers.
