Two Los Angeles County firefighters received first- and second-degree burns when the roof fell in as they battled a blaze that destroyed a house in Santa Clarita early Sunday, authorities said. 
Capt. Joe Romero received second-degree burns when the falling debris knocked off his air mask and dropped hot embers under a protective hood covering his neck, Capt. Dennis Adkins said. 
Romero and firefighter John Hannah, who also was burned on the neck, were treated at Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital and released. 
No one was in the house in the 27000 block of Pine Hills Avenue when the fire broke out about 12:12 a.m. The cause was under investigation. Damage to the house and contents was estimated at $350,000.
