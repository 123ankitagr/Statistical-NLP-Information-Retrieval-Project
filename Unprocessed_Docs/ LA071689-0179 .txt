Gov. William A. O'Neill on Saturday asked President Bush to declare parts of Connecticut a disaster area, estimating damages from last week's violent thunderstorms and tornadoes at nearly $125 million. A disaster declaration would make federal aid available for the cleanup and rebuilding of homes, businesses and public facilities.
