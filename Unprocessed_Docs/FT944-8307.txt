The world's airlines still want to expand into Russia, despite a series of
fatal crashes that have fanned concern about the safety of Russian airspace,
an international aviation official says. Pierre Jeanniot, head of IATA,
which represents some 300 airlines, said in Moscow that developing air
corridors over Russia was important for the world aviation industry.
The US State Department issued a warning about using Russian airlines last
July. It withdrew the warning last month. More than 300 people have died in
Russian air crashes this year, including 75 when a western-built Airbus
A-310, operated by an Aeroflot subsidiary, crashed in Siberia last March.
Jeanniot declined to comment in detail on Russian civil aviation and its
safety record, but said he was encouraged by a recent study on safety
inspections carried out by the US Federal Aviation Administration at the
request of the Russian transport ministry. He said IATA had been working
with Aeroflot to upgrade Russian aviation to international standards.
