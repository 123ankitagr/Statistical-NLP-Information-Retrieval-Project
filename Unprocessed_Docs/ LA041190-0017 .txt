A U.S. Army pilot guided his damaged helicopter to a safe landing at Ft. 
Sherman after hitting a tree, the U.S. Southern Command said Tuesday. The five crew members were not injured. 
The helicopter, a CH-47D Chinook on a routine training exercise, was approaching the landing strip Monday at the fort.
