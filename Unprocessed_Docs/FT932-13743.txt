LIVERPOOL Airport's attempts to block expansion of Manchester Airport and
force airlines to fly to Merseyside has been attacked by Bolton Borough
Council.
Manchester plans to build a second runway in the Cheshire green belt and to
expand capacity from 12.5m to 30m passengers a year. The plan, which will be
subject to a public inquiry next year, is opposed by local and environmental
groups.
Liverpool Airport, which handles 400,000 passengers a year, is proposing its
own underused runway as an alternative, with a 30-mile train link between
the airports.
Mr Bob Howarth, leader of Bolton council, and Mr Brian Collinge, its chief
executive, said in a joint statement: 'If Liverpool were to deny Manchester
a second runway, international traffic, particularly American, would
transfer to Europe or London.
'Airlines are not prevented from operating to Liverpool now and it is wrong
to assume denying Manchester a second runway will suddenly cause
international traffic to be attracted to Liverpool.'
