Two Insurers to Withdraw From 3 States: ITT Hartford Insurance Group and Aetna Life & Casualty Co. said they plan to withdraw from various insurance markets in three states. Aetna is dropping personal auto and homeowners' insurance in New Mexico and Idaho, saying the business is unprofitable with little hope for much improvement. Hartford, which writes only 0.2% of Michigan's personal auto insurance, wants to stop selling it there because of financial losses and regulatory restraints.
