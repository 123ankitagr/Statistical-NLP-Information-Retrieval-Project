San Diego police arrested two persons Monday on suspicion of murder in the bludgeoning death Friday night of 38-year-old Victor Avena. 
Police said Avena was attacked and killed in his home in the 3800 block of 42nd Street. Mexican authorities had found his body Sunday night in an isolated spot north of Ensenada in Baja California. 
Arrested about 12:30 p.m. Monday at a restaurant on Coronado Avenue were Avena's wife, Maria Guadalupe Oregal, 23, and her 16-year-old brother, whose name was withheld because he is a juvenile. Both had just crossed the border into the United States from Mexico.
