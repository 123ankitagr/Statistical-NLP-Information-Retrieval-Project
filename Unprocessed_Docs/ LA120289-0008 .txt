On Nov. 18, the headline ran: "Alcohol -- Not Drugs -- Detected in Tarpley." 
Please inform your headline writer, copy editor, the sports staff and the general public that alcohol is a drug. Period. 
Alcohol is a drug. Alcohol is a legal drug. Alcohol is the most used and abused drug in our nation.
