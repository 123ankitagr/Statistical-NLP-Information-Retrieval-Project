A grand jury in Cambridge, Mass., indicted a Van Nuys doctor Thursday on charges including second-degree murder in the hit-and-run death of a psychologist in April. 
Dr. John Kappler was accused of driving off the Alewife Brook Parkway in Cambridge, Mass., striking and killing Paul Mendelson, who was jogging. 
A passing Cambridge woman was also hit and suffered serious injuries. 
Kappler allegedly fled the scene and was later found by police in the psychiatric unit of a New York hospital. He has been confined to a New York state mental hospital since his arrest, said his lawyer, Jonathan Shapiro. 
Kappler was indicted by a Middlesex County grand jury on charges of second-degree murder, armed assault with intent to murder, and assault and battery with a dangerous weapon. He was expected to be arraigned on the charges next week.
