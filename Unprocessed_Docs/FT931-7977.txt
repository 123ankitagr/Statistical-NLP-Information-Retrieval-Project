LONDON maintained its status as Europe's main financial centre last year
with the number of banks leaving the city equalling those moving in.
A survey by Noel Alexander Associates, a financial statistics consultancy,
shows that 22 banks moved out of the capital last year while the same number
moved in. The number of foreign banks in London totalled 494.
