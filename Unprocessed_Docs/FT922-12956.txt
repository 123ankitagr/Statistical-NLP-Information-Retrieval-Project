CHINA is revising its patent laws to extend the patent protection period and
safeguard of chemicals and pharmaceuticals, two areas of great concern to
the US, the China Daily said, Reuter reports from Beijing.
The newspaper said Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin had told an
international conference that China would further improve its copyright laws
on its accession to 'relevant world copyright conventions.'
The head of the China Patent Office was also quoted as saying the revised
law would offer the same protection given in developed countries. The
legislative process should be completed this year, he added.
