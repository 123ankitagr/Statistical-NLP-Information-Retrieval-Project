The joint military excercise Team Spirit '89 involving 200,000 U.S. and South Korean troops ended Thursday as scheduled, the U.S. military command said. 
The exercise, held every year since 1976, was staged to test and improve the capability of South Korean and U.S. forces. 
The ground forces included about 140,000 South Korean troops and 30,000 U.S. soldiers.
