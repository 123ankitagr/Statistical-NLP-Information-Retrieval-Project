Goin' on fresh snow, 
Snow's been fallin' 
Several days, 
The ground, all is white, 
Sagebrush tops 
Stickin' out of snow; 
Ridin' through snow, it's quiet 
River where it goes. 
Just the trees are black, 
The ground, all is white; 
Where there are pine trees 
It's sorta blue, almost black 
Still farther beyond 
Wolf Teeth Mountains, pine trees are blue, 
There's nothing but the cold wind 
Look sorta like smoke; 
Ash trees, where they're thick 
It is black. 
Gray I'm ridin', 
His breath is white, 
Gray . . . ground he is like this day. 
My song, I'm singin' 
Lookin' around 
Where the sun appears 
Pink, peeps out of blue sky; 
Goin' to get many horses 
Ridin' gray, they won't see me 
In white gray, blue black winter day; 
My song, I'm singin'.
