Japanese banks are expected on Thursday to announce a sharp fall in profits
for the year to March. This follows aggressive write-offs of their bad debts
through the Co-operative Credit Purchasing Company, a bad loan purchasing
organisation set up by the banks last year.
Brokers James Capel in Tokyo predicts that the banks' transfer of bad debts
to the CCPC will total Y2,000bn (Dollars 19bn), with a further Y1,000bn
written off by the banks in straight loan-loss provisions.
