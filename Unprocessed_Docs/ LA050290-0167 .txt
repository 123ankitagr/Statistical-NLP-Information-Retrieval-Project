Sylvia Sidney, recuperating at home from double pneumonia, still plans to attend a New York ceremony that will honor her with a lifetime achievement award. 
The 79-year-old actress, who was released from Danbury Hospital on Monday, is scheduled to appear at Radio City Music Hall on Saturday for NBC's "Night of 100 Stars," where she will be honored along with Katharine Hepburn, Helen Hayes, Liv Ullmann, Sidney Lumet and Joseph L. Mankiewicz. 
"It's to benefit the Actors' Fund, and she's determined to go," said Sidney's spokesman, John Springer. "She told me: 'I may not be able to walk, but other people like Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles went in wheelchairs. I can, too.' "
