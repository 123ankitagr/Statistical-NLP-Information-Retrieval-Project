President Bush, on his visit to Beijing this weekend, will meet with Cambodian resistance leader Prince Norodom Sihanouk on efforts to end the country's decade-old guerrilla war, diplomatic sources said Wednesday. 
Bush, after attending the funeral of Emperor Hirohito in Japan, plans to make a 40-hour visit to China, and then stop for several hours in South Korea on Monday. 
Bush, who arrives Saturday afternoon in Beijing for a hectic series of meetings with Chinese leaders, will stay in a villa at the Diaoyutai state guest house on Beijing's west side. Sihanouk is currently staying at the same guest house in a villa nearby. 
Sihanouk, the former Cambodian leader, heads the three-faction resistance coalition that has fought a guerrilla war against Vietnam since the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in December, 1978, and installed a puppet government in Phnom Penh.
