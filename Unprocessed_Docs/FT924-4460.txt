Her Majesty's offer to pay income tax has had some unexpected knock-on
effects in the outer reaches of her realm. Australia's governor-general Bill
Hayden and his six state governors, for instance, are finding to their
horror they may have to follow her example.
Hayden, who takes home ADollars 95,000 a year, has the use of mansions in
Canberra and Sydney, a fleet of limos, and gets to fly in the government's
VIP aircraft. These are perks which would normally be taxed under
Australia's loathsome fringe benefits tax. But compared with the cost of
running the Queen, Hayden's annual bill of ADollars 8m makes him a bargain.
Oddly, it is the conservatives who want him to pay up. Labor MPs have been
pointing out that there would be little point in taxing Hayden because he
would have to be paid more to compensate.
But there might be some interesting arguments about liability for fringe
benefits tax. The tax is normally paid by employers. But Hayden is
technically the government's employer, which might make him personally
liable for taxation on all those houses, aircraft and cars. Alternatively,
he might argue that the Queen should pay because she employs him to
represent her.
Either way, it looks like further ammunition for Australia's republicans.
