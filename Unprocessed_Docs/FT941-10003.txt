Sir, To add a twist to recent correspondence on GPs' working hours (Letters,
February 5/6), l would like to suggest an improvement to benefit both
doctors and patients. Why not introduce a no-claims bonus system by which
patients who have made fewest calls on the doctor in the previous year are
given a priority on choice of appointment times? Perhaps for busy people, a
special early morning reserved slot could be introduced. Naturally,
night-time calls would lead to rapid loss of bonus points. Genuine
emergencies would be unaffected, provided the doctor agreed with the need
for an emergency call after attending the patient.
Now that most practices are computerised, this system should be relatively
easy to run, with perhaps three priority categories for patients.
