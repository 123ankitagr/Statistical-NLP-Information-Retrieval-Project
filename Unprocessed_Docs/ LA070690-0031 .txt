Former dissident playwright Vaclav Havel became Czechoslovakia's first freely elected president in 55 years Thursday, marking the end of the first phase in the country's move toward democracy. 
"I promise that within the limits of my prerogatives and to the best of my ability . . . I will do everything to help lead this country to a better future," he told thousands of well-wishers thronging the courtyard of Prague's Hradcany Castle, the president's official residence. 
Havel, 53, was elected for a two-year term by a secret ballot of parliamentary deputies, winning the necessary three-fifths majority. He was the only candidate. 
Of the 284 deputies present out of the 300-member Parliament, 234 voted for Havel and 50 against. 
The Parliament itself was voted into office last month, in the country's first democratic elections since 1946. 
Czechoslovakia's last freely elected president was Eduard Benes, elected in 1935, who resigned after the Communist Party seized power in 1948. 
The playwright and long-time dissident was leader of the Civic Forum human rights movement, which spearheaded the toppling of Czechoslovakia's Communist dictatorship in a peaceful popular revolt last November. 
Havel was first elected interim president in December and pledged to guide the country to free elections. After this, the new Parliament, elected for two years, was free to decide who was to lead the country.
