How do actors relax between matinee and evening performances? Tom Oleniacz, who starred as Scrooge in "A Christmas Carol" at the San Diego Repertory Theatre's Lyceum Stage, took time out Christmas Eve to marry the actress next door, Yolanda Lloyd Delgado, who plays the young bride Beatriz in the Rep's "Burning Patience" at the Lyceum Space. The honeymoon commenced with the final performance of "A Christmas Carol." "Burning Patience" returns to the Rep for one week in January.
