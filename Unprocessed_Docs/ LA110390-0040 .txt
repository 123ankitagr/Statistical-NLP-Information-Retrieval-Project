A longtime Van Nuys businessman and philanthropist was given the Fernando Award, the San Fernando Valley's highest honor for volunteerism, at a ceremony Friday night. 
Samuel Greenberg, 81, owner of Sam's U-Drive Rentals, received the award at the Sportsmen's Lodge in Studio City. 
"His accomplishments in the San Fernando Valley have been extraordinary," said Laurie Golden, a spokeswoman for Fernando Award Inc. "It's easy sometimes for some people to give money but he gives his time as well . . . all quietly." 
Greenberg has been a major contributor to the San Fernando Assn. for the Retarded Inc., the New Horizons' project for the disabled and the March of Dimes. 
In addition, he has served on the Los Angeles Human Rights Commission, the Mayor's Committee on Aging, and is the president of the Los Angeles Board of Airport Commissioners. 
Presented since 1959, the award honors outstanding civic accomplishments in the Valley.
