Russell White of Crespi High, the state's all-time leading rusher and scorer, said that he will announce his college choice Tuesday at the Encino school. 
White has whittled his list of college preferences to Cal, USC and Washington. He took the last of his 3 trips last weekend to Washington. He said that the field remains wide open and that he has yet to decide. The first day high school seniors can sign national letters of intent is Wednesday. 
In his 3-year varsity football career at Crespi, White set state records for rushing (5,998), touchdowns (94) and points (568).
