A suspected auto burglar who was fatally shot in a struggle with a campus police officer at Cal State Northridge was identified Wednesday as Jeffrey Dunn, 20, of Van Nuys, Los Angeles police said. 
Dunn, who was not a student at the university, apparently was trying to break into a car parked in Lot K near Halsted Street and Lindley Avenue about 7 p.m. Tuesday when he was confronted by Sgt. Jay McTaggert, said Detective Michael Brandt. 
During a struggle with McTaggert, Dunn tried to grab the officer's .38-caliber revolver and the gun fired, Brandt said. Los Angeles County coroner's reports said the bullet went through Dunn's arm and entered his brain behind the left ear. He died at the scene. 
McTaggert, 33, an 8-year veteran of the campus police force, suffered minor injuries in the struggle. 
Brandt said detectives would continue to investigate the shooting. 
Campus police said auto burglaries have increased at the university in recent months.
