Japan's Emperor Akihito will formally ascend the Chrysanthemum Throne next Monday in an ancient rite to be witnessed by Vice President Dan Quayle and dignitaries from 156 other countries. 
Akihito technically became emperor in January, 1989, upon the death of his father, Hirohito. But Monday's ceremony is part of an ancient set of rites that celebrate the new emperor and the nation following a period of official mourning. 
A second, deeply religious and controversial Shinto rite enthronement ceremony closed to foreigners is to follow on Nov. 22.
