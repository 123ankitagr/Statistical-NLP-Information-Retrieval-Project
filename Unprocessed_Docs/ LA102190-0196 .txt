Andre Waters of the Philadelphia Eagles was fined "a substantial amount," by the NFL for hitting Minnesota quarterback Rich Gannon below the knees after Gannon released a touchdown pass Monday night. 
League spokesman Greg Aiello said the fine was levied by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue after a review of tapes of Monday night's game, won, 32-24, by the Eagles. 
Aiello did not divulge the amount of the fine. It was believed, however, to be about $10,000. 
Waters, Philadelphia's free safety, was blitzing on the play, a 78-yard touchdown pass to Cris Carter, and hit Gannon below the knees -- in violation of a rule enacted in 1989 after Waters did the same to Jim Everett of the Rams in 1988. 
There was no penalty called on Waters for hitting Gannon. 
Waters previously had been fined for late hits and also met with then-commissioner Pete Rozelle in April 1989 to discuss what some considered dirty play. Waters has maintained he plays within the rules.
