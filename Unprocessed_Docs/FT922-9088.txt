Hopes for a quick recovery to the housing market still look far off as
lending for house purchases continues to reveal a steady decline. Quarterly
figures released this week were described by the Council of Mortgage Lenders
as 'very subdued.' They show that net new lending by banks, building
societies and other financial institutions for house purchases dropped in
the last quarter to Pounds 4.6bn compared with Pounds 5.4bn in the last
quarter of 1991. The Halifax house price index, also released this week,
fell by 0.4 per cent last month. The building society said that, 'even
adjusting for seasonality, the trend in house prices also remained weak.' UK
house prices are now 5.5 per cent below this time last year.
