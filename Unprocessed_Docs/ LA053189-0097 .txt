Black recipients of donor kidneys fare as well as whites, a transplant doctor reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of Transplant Physicians in Chicago. His report contradicted other studies that have found blacks tend to do much worse after such surgery. "Even in our program, back in 1982, 1983, 1984, they (blacks) did a little worse. Lately, they don't, and overall they do as well as whites," said Dr. Ingemar Dawidson, associate professor of surgery at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. Dr. Clive O. Callender, head of the Howard University Hospital Transplant Center, said studies encompassing larger pools of patients show kidney transplants are 10% to 20% less successful in blacks than whites.
