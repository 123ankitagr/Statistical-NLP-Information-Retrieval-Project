A ROMANIAN nationalist mayor has banned Hungarian language posters in the
ethnically mixed Transylvanian town of Cluj.
Mr Gheorghe Funar said he had outlawed the posters which advertised a
Hungarian language theatre festival because they refer to 'Kolozsvari', the
Hungarian name for the town.
'I am the mayor of Cluj. There is no such place as Kolozsvari in Romania,'
he said.
A spokesman for the ethnic Hungarian party said the mayor's move was the
latest in a 'deliberately provocative hate campaign' against local ethnic
Hungarians who form nearly a quarter of the 330 inhabitants of the town
which was once capital of Hungarian-ruled Transylvania.
Mr Funar, who ran unsuccessfully against President Ion Iliescu in
presidential elections this year, has imposed several curbs on minority
rights.
This recently prompted Hungarians to demand limited self-rule for their
communities in Transylvania.
Romania has 1.6m ethnic Hungarians, 7 per cent of the country's population,
according to a census this year.
Transylvania, where most of the Hungarian minority live, was ruled by
neighbouring Hungary before 1918.
