The prime ministers of North and South Korea, separated by the Cold War's
last frontier, exchanged documents yesterday ratifying historic agreements
on non-aggression and renouncing nuclear weapons on the divided peninsula,
where 1.5m troops still confront each other across the border, Reuter
reports from Seoul.
But the ceremony was overshadowed by southern suspicions that North Korea
was stalling inspections of its nuclear facilities while continuing to
develop nuclear weapons. Some analysts believe Pyongyang could have a
workable crude device by next year.
