Country singer Naomi Judd announced Wednesday in Nashville that she will retire early next year for health reasons. The announcement signals the end of the Judds, the mother and daughter team that has been one of country music's most successful attractions since 1984. 
Judd, 44, who was found to have hepatitis 10 months ago, said the retirement will come at the end the duo's current "Love Can Build a Bridge" tour. Wynonna, her 26-year-old daughter, plans to continue in country music as a solo artist. 
The Judds, who have had more than a dozen No. 1 country hits, including "Why Not Me" and "Grandpa (Tell Me 'Bout the Good Old Days)," have been honored by the Country Music Assn. as the field's best vocal group/duo for the past six years.
