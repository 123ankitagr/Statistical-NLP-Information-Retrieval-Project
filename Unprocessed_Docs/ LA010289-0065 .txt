In the advertising industry, 1989 may best be described as the year of the poacher. Because most executives are expecting billings growth of only 6% to 7%, there are increasing suspicions that the only sure-fire way to grow larger in 1989 will be to steal the business from someone else. 
Already, a slew of agencies are chasing after all or parts of the $200- million Burger King business that is now up for grabs. And in mid-December, Admarketing, a Los Angeles ad agency, dumped the $15-million HomeClub ad business in order to take away the more lucrative, $25-million Home Depot advertising account from a competitor. 
Also, as advertising giants like Kraft, Pillsbury and RJR Nabisco continue to mix it up in the buyout arena, a number of client conflicts could arise, forcing some ad agencies to make tough decisions on which clients to keep -- and how to keep all clients happy. 
Generally, advertising executives expect that their clients will continue to spend more money on various forms of sales promotion and direct marketing -- and less in more conventional forms of advertising such as network television and radio. BRUCE HOROVITZ
