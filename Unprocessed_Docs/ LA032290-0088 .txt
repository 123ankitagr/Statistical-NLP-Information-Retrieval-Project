Jackson Removes Black Leopard From Act: Singer Janet Jackson says she won't use a black leopard in her act because fans have expressed concern about its welfare. 
Jackson said through her publicist on Tuesday that she removed the leopard from her act in New York, where she performed last week. Some audience members worried the animal could be harmed being carted from location to location on Jackson's current worldwide tour. Jackson, sister of singer Michael Jackson, is a noted animal lover. "I love animals and would never do any harm, or allow anyone to do any harm to one," she said. "I would rather do without the cat."
