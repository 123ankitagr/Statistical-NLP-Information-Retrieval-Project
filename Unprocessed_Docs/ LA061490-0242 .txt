Talk show host Arsenio Hall will welcome a variety of rap music superstars to his television program tonight for the first live performance of the anti-gang song "We're All in the Same Gang." 
The song, coordinated by a former gang member, features performances by rappers Ice-T, Young MC, MC Hammer, Def Jef, N.W.A. and Eazy-E. 
The performance on the syndicated "Arsenio Hall Show" kicks off Peace Weekend, an attempt to appeal to gang members to stop fighting this weekend and beyond. 
Proceeds from the record of "We're All in the Same Gang" will go to three Los Angeles County youth organizations.
