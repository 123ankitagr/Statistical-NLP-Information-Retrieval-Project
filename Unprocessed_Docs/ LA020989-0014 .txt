Thank you, Elie Shneour. As the conservative Supreme Court considers the Missouri case on abortion, I tremble at the thought of a Roe vs. Wade setback. Will the court then listen to a minority faction that insists women and men must not "murder" the egg and sperm every month? No birth control, but undue procreation in an already overpopulated globe? 
It is relatively easy to carry a sign saying "Stop the Murder of Babies" but spending time to help the living survive is another matter. 
As a schoolteacher, I see students every day who are abused in a home environment. This to me is more of a sin than stopping an egg and sperm from developing in the first trimester. 
The Constitution was written with wisdom so that one religious group could not impose its morals on others. So be it!
