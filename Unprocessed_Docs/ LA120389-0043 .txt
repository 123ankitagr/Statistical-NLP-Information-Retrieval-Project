Your article about non-alcoholic beer ("Miller Brewing Rolls Out a New Non-Alcoholic Beer," Oct. 31) erred in not informing your readers that "non-alcoholic" beer is not no-alcohol beer! So-called non-alcoholic beer still may contain up to 0.5% ethyl alcohol under federal law. 
It's high time for the fine print on near-beer labels to be enlarged so that the consumer can be better informed as to the true alcohol content by volume of each beer container. 
No license is required to sell these products, and no identification need be demanded of minors. Recovering alcoholics, pregnant women, minors and those with special medical or health reasons who shouldn't drink alcohol had better beware.
