Western trade officials agreed yesterday to lift security restrictions on
the export of sensitive technology goods to Hungary as soon as Budapest
tightens its own export control procedures, writes Ian Davidson in Paris.
The agreement is the latest in a series of moves to liberalise western
controls on the export of strategically sensitive goods to the ex-Soviet
Union and its former Warsaw Pact allies in eastern Europe. A meeting in
Paris of the Co-ordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls also
agreed to continue to work for the liberation of trade with Poland and
Czechoslovakia.
