THE South Korean government predicted yesterday that its tense relations
with North Korea will ease later this year.
Progress in inter-Korean relations has been blocked for the past year by
Pyongyang's refusal to allow Seoul to make challenge inspections of
suspected nuclear weapon facilities.
South Korea and the US will also resume their suspended annual 'Team Spirit'
military exercise in March in an effort to force Pyongyang to make a
concession. North Korea has responded by breaking off talks on nuclear
inspections and other issues with Seoul.
But senior Seoul officials meeting on the unification issue said yesterday
that North Korea would ease its stance once the exercises were over because
of the need to revive its troubled economy. Seoul estimates that the North
Korean economy contracted by 5 per cent in 1992 due to an oil shortage that
is hampering industrial production.
In spite of the political stalemate between the two Koreas, Mr Kim Dal Hyon,
the North Korean deputy prime minister, met executives of several big South
Korean conglomerates, including Samsung, Daewoo and Lucky-Goldstar, in
Beijing two months ago to discuss investment in North Korea.
North Korea has also recently made attempts to improve relations with Japan
and the US to attract foreign investment.
