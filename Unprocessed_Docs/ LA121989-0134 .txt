Robert E. Page, former publisher of the Chicago Sun-Times, has agreed to purchase the Orange Coast Daily Pilot and four local weekly newspapers from Adams Communications Corp. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. 
Page said the Pilot offices in Costa Mesa would serve as headquarters for a "Southern California publishing company," and that "other transactions are pending." He would not discuss what other papers he may be purchasing, but he reportedly is interested in a group of weekly newspapers in Northern San Diego County that are for sale. 
The Pilot, purchased by Adams Communications from Ingersoll Publications last year, has a circulation of about 23,000 centered in the Costa Mesa-Newport Beach area. The weekly newspapers -- all called the Independent -- serve Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Huntington Beach and Fountain Valley. 
Pilot Publisher Rosemary Churchman has resigned, but Page said other staff changes were not anticipated at this time. 
Page said his deal with Adams was expected to close "within 72 hours."
