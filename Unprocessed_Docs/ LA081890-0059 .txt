Two Redding men on a midnight duck hunt in Marina del Rey were arrested early Friday for firing at birds in a protected wildlife area. 
Sean Burns Jackson, 26, and Richard Theodore Arellano, 20, both of Redding, face charges of firing a gun in a negligent manner, possessing loaded firearms in a vehicle and cruelty to animals, Sheriff's Deputy Gabe Ramirez said. 
A resident called about 2 a.m. deputies, saying two men were shooting at ducks in a pond near the 4100 block of Admiralty Way, Ramirez said. The men drove away in a pickup truck, but were arrested eight blocks away. Deputies found two rifles and a shotgun in their truck and the suspects admitted they had been shooting at ducks, Ramirez said. 
No dead ducks were found in the truck or at the pond, which is in a wetlands area set aside when the marina was built.
