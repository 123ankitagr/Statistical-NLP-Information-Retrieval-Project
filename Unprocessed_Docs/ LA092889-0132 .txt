El Salvador's leftist rebels said they have inflicted more than 200 military casualties in their new offensive, but they still promised to take part in planned peace talks. The rebels' Radio Venceremos said the offensive, begun late Monday in at least nine of El Salvador's 14 provinces, left 228 government troops dead or wounded and nine captured. It said 11 rebels died. The armed forces, however, said that 33 rebels and 24 soldiers died in the offensive, while 38 guerrillas, 19 government troops and seven civilians were wounded. The attacks came less than two weeks after the rebels and the government agreed to monthly peace talks. Rebel commander Joaquin Villalobos said the rebels will participate in the next session, scheduled Oct. 16-17.
