The International Amateur Boxing Assn. Sunday levied two-year suspensions against five judges and referees accused of inefficiency and not officiating in accordance with international rules, and five South Korean boxers and officials involved in a brawl during the 1988 Olympic Games. 
Thirteen other officials, also accused of not officiating in accordance with international rules during the Seoul Games, were suspended from officiating in the world amateur boxing championships at Moscow in September, AIBA president Anwar Chowdhry of Pakistan said at the governing body's meeting at Nairobi, Kenya. 
The five South Koreans were suspended from AIBA events for two years for being involved in a brawl in the ring during an Olympic event. 
They attacked New Zealand referee Keith Walker after a Korean lost a 4-1 decision to a Bulgarian. 
The organization also denied an appeal by the U.S. Amateur Boxing Federation seeking a reversal of a Seoul Olympic gold medal awarded to South Korean Park Si Hun in the light middleweight final against Roy Jones.
