The controversy over 2 Live Crew and the alleged obscene lyrics of its "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" album apparently is fueling their Los Angeles-area popularity. 
Promoters have added a late show to the group's one-night stand at the Country Club in Reseda on Wednesday. The 9 p.m. show is almost sold out, they said. 
Tickets for the 10:30 show go on sale Sunday at the Country Club box office and Ticketmaster outlets. Tickets are $20. 
2 Live Crew is also scheduled to play July 27 at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim.
