Highly recommended: 
"TWISTER"(U.S., 1989; Director: Michael Almereyda; Century Plaza, 4:15 p.m.). A strange and altogether fascinating comedy from writer-director Almereyda, his directorial debut. It's about a screw-loose Kansas family, and the cast is assembled like prize specimens in a zoo. Crispin Glover's performance is one of the great wacko characterizations in film. (P.R.)
