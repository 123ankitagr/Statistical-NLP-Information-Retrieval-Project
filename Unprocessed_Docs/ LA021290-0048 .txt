At least six people were killed, including five children, in a Salvadoran air force bombing raid on a refugee settlement, witnesses said. Fierce ground fighting between guerrillas and government troops preceded the bombing, but the guerrillas had not been inside the settlement, witnesses said. One witness reported 20 injured, in addition to the six dead, who were believed to be from the same family.
