The EC imposed permanent duties of 30.6 per cent on exports of allegedly
under-priced Chinese mountain bikes yesterday, Reuter reports from Brussels.
The duties will be effective from Saturday, according to the EC's official
journal, replacing provisional duties of 34.4 per cent imposed in March.
Local manufacturers complained that the Chinese bikes were undermining their
market. The Commission found that Chinese prices undercut EC prices by a
weighted 59 per cent. The duties will be on all Chinese bicycles, not just
the large-tyre, mountain variety.
