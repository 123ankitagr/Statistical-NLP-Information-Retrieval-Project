Seventy members and associates of three San Diego Crip gangs have been arrested in a yearlong undercover investigation aimed at street-level drug dealers, authorities said. "Operation Blue Rag," a federally funded operation targeting the gang members, swept a number of suspected drug traffickers from neighborhoods with notorious reputations as hangouts for crack cocaine dealing and other criminal activity, the San Diego County district attorney's office said. Eight of the suspects were arrested on federal charges but the majority were booked on state charges involving drug sales and possession of drugs and weapons.
