CHINA Steel's planned Dollars 400m equity offering is likely to be the first
sale of global depositary receipts (GDRs) by a Taiwanese company, opening a
new avenue for international equity investment in the country, writes Simon
London.
GDRs are like the American depositary receipts (ADRs) issued by overseas
companies in the US. Shares underlying the receipts are held by a
depositary, usually a bank, and the GDRs are traded over the counter.
Currently, equity investors in Taiwan must either buy convertible bonds or
invest through one of 16 foreign banks which have been allocated fixed
limits for direct investment by the government.
Both routes have drawbacks. There is no legal mechanism for bonds to be
converted into equity, so buyers are gambling that new regulations allowing
conversion will be introduced before the bonds mature.
Direct investment through approved foreign banks is complex and has not
proved popular. Only Dollars 350m has been invested in this way, against a
total limit of Dollars 750m agreed with the government.
Once the China Steel offering has been launched, other Taiwanese companies
are planning to launch either GDR or convertible bond issues. President
Enterprises, the food company, hopes to make a Dollars 100m GDR issue by the
summer.
