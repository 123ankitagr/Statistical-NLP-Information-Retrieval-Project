A bid to end a damaging monthlong strike at Peugeot, France's biggest private auto maker, appeared to be in jeopardy today after strikers refused to end their occupation of a key foundry. 
Trade union officials said one group of strikers voted to continue a sit-in at the Mulhouse foundry in eastern France. 
The strike by several hundred workers at the Sochaux and Mulhouse plants -- a small minority of the work force -- has cut back production of Peugeot's best-selling 205 model and cast a shadow over the launch of the luxury 605 model. 
First deliveries were made to showrooms Monday morning and a Peugeot spokesman said there were enough cars to meet initial orders. 
A spokesman for the car maker, which employs 145,000 people in France, said Peugeot will withdraw its offer of talks if the strikers failed to leave the foundry by Wednesday.
