A man awaiting a murder trial and who already is serving a 9-year sentence for bilking women he met in bars pleaded guilty Monday to escaping the El Cajon jail. 
Raymond Stone, 41, pleaded guilty on the day that his trial for the Feb. 27 escape was to begin in San Diego County Superior Court. 
He could be sentenced to a maximum of five years, which could run either concurrently or consecutively with his nine-year sentence. 
Stone's escape rope, made of bedsheets, ripped while he was dangling outside the jail, and he suffered back injuries in the fall. 
He is charged with murdering and robbing Anita Dalfoss, 50, of El Cajon, who was last seen March 14, 1989. Her skeletal remains were found near Lake Henshaw last summer. 
Judge William Mudd set July 2 for sentencing Stone on the escape case. The murder trial is scheduled for July 16.
