Chinese household and electrical appliances are showing rapid growth in
production, domestic sales and exports in 1994, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The China Household Electrical Appliances Association reported that rising
consumer confidence had boosted both output and sales of refrigerators,
washing machines and air-conditioners.
Ms Jiang Feng, the association's vice-general secretary, told the China
Daily newspaper that growing demand for smaller electrical appliances, such
as irons, microwave ovens and electric cookers is stimulating producers to
upgrade their products.
In foreign markets, nine-month exports of Chinese appliances were Dollars
1.08bn compared with Dollars 1.35bn for all of 1993, the newspaper said.
Air-conditioners were the fastest growing export item. In the first six
months of 1994, China exported 156,000 units, an increase of 90,000 over the
same period in 1993.
China has more than 100 air-conditioner manufacturers, including 20 large
groups. In the past, imports have cut into domestic sales, resulting in
large stocks of unsold units, the China Daily said. In 1993, China imported
more than 100,000 foreign-made air-conditioners and competition from abroad
had spurred Chinese manufacturers to improve the quality of their
air-conditioners, according to the newspaper. The appliance Association
predicted that Chinese brands would achieve dominance in the domestic
air-conditioner market next year, just as Chinese freezers, refrigerators
and washing machines have become dominant in their respective market
sectors.
In the first nine months of 1994, China produced 8.2m washing machines, a
27.2 per cent increase from the same period in 1993. Washing-machine output
for the full current year is expected to reach 10m units.
