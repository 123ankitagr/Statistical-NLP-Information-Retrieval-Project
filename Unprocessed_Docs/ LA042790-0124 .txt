Joe Montana, who quarterbacked San Francisco to its fourth Super Bowl title in January, said he wants to play at least three more years and help the 49ers win an unprecedented third consecutive championship. 
"I have three years left on my contract," Montana said. "I would like to play at least three (seasons), and year-by-year I would like to see physically and mentally how I am."
