Steven Soderbergh, the young director of the surprise hit "sex, lies, and videotape," has received the first John Cassavetes award given to the individual who has made the greatest contribution to American independent film making this year. The award is in honor of the late director and actor who died in February. Soderbergh, the 26-year-old director whose film won the top prize earlier this year at the Cannes Film Festival, received the award at the opening of the 12th Denver International Film Festival.
