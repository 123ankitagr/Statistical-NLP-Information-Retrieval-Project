Too bad "our" Giants couldn't do what "their" Giants did ("Yomiuri Giants Win the Japan Series," Oct. 30). And they did it the impossible way: They lost three in a row, then won four in a row. 
If our Giants feel bad, they should phone the Kintetsu Buffaloes and hear their story. I'll bet it's a classic, surely a dynasty in the rough.
