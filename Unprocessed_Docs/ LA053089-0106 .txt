A Woodland Hills man was arrested on suspicion of murder after he allegedly caused a fatal accident while driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol, El Monte police said today. 
Antonio Tobar, 25, was being held without bail at the El Monte jail. Detective Richard Williams said Tobar was driving eastbound through El Monte on Garvey Avenue at 9 p.m. Monday when he used a parking lane to speed around several cars stopped at the intersection of Central Avenue. As Tobar tried to drive through the intersection at 60 m.p.h. he crashed into a car driven by Lorenza Bernal, 36, of Asuza, who was turning onto Garvey Avenue, Williams said. 
A passenger in Bernal's car, Hermanino Correa, 30, of El Monte, was killed by the impact of the collision. Police said Bernal, Tobar and Tobar's passenger, Carlos Hernandez, 25, of La Puente, all suffered minor injuries.
