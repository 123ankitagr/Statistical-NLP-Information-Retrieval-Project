BRITAIN'S national newspaper proprietors are investigating the possibility
of advertising less on television and promoting the use of each others'
publications instead.
The press - primarily the tabloids - has sometimes spent nearly Pounds 50m a
year on television advertising, but this has had little long-term effect on
circulations.
Mr Robert Maxwell, the chairman of Mirror Group Newspapers, said yesterday
that the industry was convinced that advertising on television was a mug's
game.
'We intend to spend far less money on television than we have done in the
past,' Mr Maxwell said.
Newspaper industry executives point to the poor impression advertising on
television creates - newspapers try to sell advertising to others and then
go on television to promote their own products.
There have already been preliminary discussions at the Newspaper Publishers
Association. A group under Sir Tim Bell, the advertising industry
specialist, is looking into the issue of the cost and effectiveness of
newspaper advertising. Centralised ways of promoting the concept of
national-newspaper advertising are also being considered.
It is not clear whether the fiercely independent national newspaper owners
would ever collectively agree to abandon television advertising. It might
even be illegal under competition law if they did.
