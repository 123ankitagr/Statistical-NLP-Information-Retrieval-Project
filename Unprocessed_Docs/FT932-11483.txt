Sir, The complexities of price comparisons between the US and UK and between
BT and Mercury are such that even your reporter has been misled.
The article 'Competition on the line' (April 29) actually compared Mercury's
best 'peak' price to the US (8am to 8pm) with BT's 'off-peak' price.
The correct comparison for a three-minute call to the US, taking the best
business price for each company in 'peak' time is 122.15p from Mercury and
123.55p from BT. While Mercury charges for the exact call length, to the
nearest 100th of a second, BT still charges by the unit. This means that the
BT customer has to pay for the unused time left over. Taking this into
account statistically, Mercury's best business price saves customers an
average of 8 per cent in the 'peak' period.
The leading independent expert's comparison (Octagon Telecomms Tariffs 1993)
concludes 'if a customer does have access to the directly connected Mercury
2100 service, there are no grounds from a pricing point of view for using BT
for any outgoing calls'.
In terms of benefit to UK business, it is now cheaper to call the US, or
anywhere in Europe, using Mercury than in the reverse direction.
