Arcane world, the financial futures business. The latest advert for the
French exchange Matif depicts a helmet, accompanied by a truly mystifying
slogan to the effect that 'protecting your assets is not as difficult as you
may think . . . Before grabbing your helmet, give us a call'.
Head suitably naked, Observer rang in search of a translation. Just what did
this particular piece of headgear have to do with a French franc-denominated
option or any other of the market's weird and wonderful wares?
'It is a medieval 'at,' a voice in the communications department explained
patiently. Puzzled silence from London. 'You know what an 'elmet is? I don't
know what your problem is.' Ah well.
