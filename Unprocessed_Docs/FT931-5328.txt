DR PHILIP McGarry, a consultant psychiatrist, is to be the chairman of
Ulster's non-sectarian Alliance Party.
His appointment follows the resignation of Mr Addie Morrow, who said he was
disillusioned with the province's tribal politics.
Mr Morrow, 63, a farmer from Castlereagh, Belfast, was a founder member of
the pro-Union party set up in 1970 with a Protestant and Catholic
membership.
