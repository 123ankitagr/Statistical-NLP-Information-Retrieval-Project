Liverpool and Manchester airports yesterday made applications for expansion.
The airports are less than 30 miles apart and it is expected that only one
plan will be approved.
Manchester wants a second runway to double its capacity of 15m passengers a
year. Liverpool, with fewer than 750,000 passengers a year, wants to expand
to 6m passengers by 2010 and 12m by 2030.
