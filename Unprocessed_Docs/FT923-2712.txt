MR DONALD Bainton, who resigned as president of Continental Can company nine
years ago after a disagreement over the company's strategy, is getting
belated revenge by buying back the name of the largely dismembered group
from its current owner, the diversified Pieter Kiewit group.
Mr Bainton will use Continental Can as the new name for Viatech, a packaging
company with significant European interests which he has built up since the
mid-1980s.
He also announced that Viatech, which is currently quoted on the American
Stock Exchange, would seek a listing under its new name on the larger New
York Stock Exchange.
The company has also signed an agreement to raise from 50 per cent to 100
per cent its stake in Plastic Containers, a joint venture with Mexico's
Zapata packaging family.
Plastic Containers is a vehicle used in 1991 for the Dollars 153m purchase
of Continental Plastic Containers, a US company which is the last remaining
packaging unit of the old Continental Can company.
Mr Bainton, 61, says he is keen to build up Continental into a much larger
packaging company by making further acquisitions.
In 1984 - a year after Mr Bainton resigned from Continental Can - the
company was sold to Peter Kiewit, which has since disposed of many of the
company's subsidiaries.
After leaving Continental Can, Mr Bainton joined Viatech, an engineering
company in which his brother had a significant interest, and moved it into
packaging through the acquisition of Germany's Dixie Union Verpackingen,
Spain's Onena Bolsas de Papel, and France's Ferembal. Mr Bainton and his
brother hold 42 per cent of the stock of Viatech.
