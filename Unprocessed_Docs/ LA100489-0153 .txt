Designer Patrick Kelly, the only American stylist accepted as a member of the French fashion establishment, has pulled out of this month's ready-to-wear collections because of an unspecified illness. 
A press spokeswoman said today the Mississippi-born Kelly is convalescing and would be unable to present the spring and summer collection.
