THE OPERATOR of the trans-Alaska pipeline has agreed to pay the state of
Alaska and the federal government Dollars 32m (Pounds 21m) to settle
outstanding lawsuits related to the 1989 oil spill off the Alaska coast by
the Exxon Valdez, writes Alan Friedman in New York.
Alyeska Pipeline Service Company, a consortium of oil companies formed to
operate the pipeline, had been accused of failing to respond rapidly to the
Valdez spill.
Under the agreed settlement, the money paid out by Alyeska will be used to
build docks and warehouses to store equipment for the clean-up.
US authorities had previously settled their legal actions against Exxon,
which said last year it would pay a record Dollars 1bn fine in connection
with the Valdez disaster.
The state of Alaska is to receive Dollars 900m from Exxon, over 10 years, to
settle civil charges, while Exxon and its Exxon Shipping subsidiary have
agreed to pay a Dollars 150m fine to Alaska to settle criminal charges.
