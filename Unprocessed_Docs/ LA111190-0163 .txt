The San Diego City Council's revocation of the opening of Pomerado Road ("S.D. Council Revokes Plan to Reopen Pomerado Road," Nov. 6) is petty and arrogant. 
Too bad about extra traffic coming through Scripps Ranch. Every community in greater San Diego has the same problem, but they don't fence off public streets. 
The city of San Diego and the council should be ashamed of being so small-minded. I sentence all of them to two hours of nonstop driving on I-15 at rush hour for at least six months.
