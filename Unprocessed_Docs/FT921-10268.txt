A BREAKTHROUGH in the treatment of severe asthma could open up the way for a
new range of anti-asthma drugs.
Doctors at the Royal Brompton National Heart & Lung Hospital and the London
Chest Hospital have found that cyclosporin A, a drug used to suppress organ
rejection after transplant surgery, produced a marked improvement in chronic
asthma sufferers.
At the moment most patients need high doses or oral steroids, which can
produce side effects.
The cyclosporin A drug works by suppressing the T lymphocyte immune cells in
the body. Researchers at the Royal Brompton hospital have suspected for some
time that these white blood cells play an important role in causing
asthmatic symptoms.
The results of their research, published in this week's The Lancet, mean
drugs could be developed in the future which treat asthma effectively but
are less toxic and more selective than today's treatments.
