Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Ira Reiner has announced that evidence derived from genetic fingerprinting will be used to prosecute two suspects in the rape and murder of a Pasadena woman last October. 
This would be the first time the county has used the technique, which involves matching the genetic makeup of a suspect with blood or semen samples. 
Ronald Anthony Jones and George Marvin Trone have been charged with kidnaping 26-year-old Lois Haro at the Plaza Pasadena Mall, raping her and then killing her. 
Tests concluded that the genetic patterns found in semen and blood samples were almost perfect matches for both defendants, officials said. 
DNA, found in all cells, carries each individual's genetic blueprint and determines everything from hair color to gender. Each individual's genetic code is unique, except in the case of identical twins. 
A lawyer for one of the suspects said he will contest introduction of the findings at a preliminary hearing scheduled for March 21. Both suspects have pleaded not guilty.
