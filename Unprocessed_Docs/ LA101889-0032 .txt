Czech playwright Vaclav Havel plans to donate a $13,000 literary award to the West German book trade to help banned Eastern Bloc authors get their works published. Havel, Czechoslovakia's most prominent dissident and a 1989 Nobel Peace Prize nominee, was not allowed to travel to Frankfurt to accept an annual peace prize awarded by the book trade. His acceptance speech announcing his donation was read by Swiss actor Maximilian Schell. STEVE WEINSTEIN
