South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday played down reports that
North Korea had probably developed nuclear bombs, Reuter reports from Seoul.
'North Korea has strong intentions to develop nuclear weapons. But (I)
cannot say North Korea possesses any nuclear arms at the moment,' Yonhap
news agency quoted Mr Kim as saying.
On Sunday, the New York Times said the US Central Intelligence Agency had
advised President Bill Clinton that North Korea had probably built one or
two nuclear bombs.
