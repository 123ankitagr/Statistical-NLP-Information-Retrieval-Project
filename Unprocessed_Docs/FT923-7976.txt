Sir, Considering the usual enlightened approach by the Financial Times
towards age, Observer's continuing obsession with retirement and the age of
directors ('An age old problem', August 10, is the latest instalment) is
puzzling.
Why should the age of directors or the duration of their appointment be of
importance to shareholders? Is there any reliable evidence that younger
directors run better companies than old ones? If age is so important, why
does his or her age, and the duration of his/her appointment, not appear at
the head of Observer's column? The same could apply to all your reporters
and editorial writers.
The continued contribution to the economy of older men and women should be
encouraged rather than criticised.
