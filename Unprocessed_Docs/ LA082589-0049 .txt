Grenada's government suspended Parliament amid opposition threats to bring Prime Minister Herbert Blaize down with a no-confidence vote. Blaize, who lost leadership of his New National Party, has been under intense pressure over what critics call an increasingly authoritarian style. The suspension means Blaize can govern without any parliamentary opposition until as late as February, a month before general elections are due. Opposition leader George Brizan accused Blaize, 71, of treating Parliament with "ridicule and contempt" during the Caribbean island's most serious political crisis since the 1983 revolution and subsequent U.S.-led invasion. Parliament is being suspended for an indefinite period.
