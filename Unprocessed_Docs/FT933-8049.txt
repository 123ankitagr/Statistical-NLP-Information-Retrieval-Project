Alan Jones, 49, has joined Kalon, the paints group, as managing director of
the decorative paints division. Formerly he was managing director of Paul's
Food Group, which is the cereals part of Harrisons & Crosfield, the
chemicals, timber and building supplies, food and agriculture, and
plantations group.
Before that, Jones had been managing director of Adams Foods; indeed Mike
Hennessy, Kalon group managing director, says that he has been a managing
director for 15 years.
Jones takes over the job, which involves the day-to-day running of the
division, from Hennessy himself, who therefore knew the kind of replacement
he was looking for. Hennessy says he had only interviewed about six people
and had been happy to wait until he had found the right candidate.
The appointment will free Hennessy, also 49 and a crucial influence on the
rapid growth of Kalon, to concentrate on his role of developing the group as
a whole. He is keen to push both the group's development in continental
Europe following the acquisition of Novodec in France and the expansion of
the new specialist products division in the UK.
