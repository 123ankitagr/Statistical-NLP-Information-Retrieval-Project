The recent reshuffle at Italy's state holding companies has seen Ernesto
Pascale promoted to the post of managing director of Stet, the
telecommunications holding company which should be privatised within the
next year, writes Andrew Hill.
Only three months ago, Pascale, 59, was named chairman and managing director
of Telecom Italia, the newly formed Stet subsidiary which groups together
all Italy's telecoms operating companies, including Sip, the domestic
operator where he had been chairman for the previous three years.
But then last month, Michele Tedeschi, Stet's managing director, was asked
to take over as chairman of Iri, the state holding company which is Stet's
parent. Pascale (below) has now stepped into Tedeschi's shoes, and will play
an important role - in tandem with Tedeschi - in the co-ordination of what
some analysts refer to as 'the mother of all Italian privatisations'.
Only the timing of Pascale's move was unexpected; otherwise the promotion
was in line with his steady rise through the Italian telecoms sector.
Pascale joined Stet in 1956 straight from university in Rome. He transferred
to Sip in 1977, and also worked for more than seven years as managing
director of Italcable - the telecoms company now part of Telecom Italia.
His combined chairman/managing director job at Telecom Italia has been split
between Umberto Silvestri, who took over as chairman earlier this month, and
Francesco Chirichigno, who has become managing director.
