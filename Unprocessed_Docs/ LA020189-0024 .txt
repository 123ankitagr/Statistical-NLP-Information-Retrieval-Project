Ruby Mae Brown remains in jail because she refused Tuesday to turn over her assault rifle and other guns to authorities after making death threats against officials trying to shut down her animal kennel. 
Brown refused to attend her bail review hearing before San Diego Municipal Judge E. Mac Amos Jr., and waived her presence, which can be done in a misdemeanor case. 
Her attorney, Dawn Beebee, told the court that Brown said her weapons are in storage somewhere and not in her possession. 
Amos said, however, that he wanted her to give up those weapons. He said he would release her on her own recognizance only after she turns over the guns and only if she agrees to not possess any firearms. 
Brown faces trial Feb. 7 on 285 misdemeanor counts of animal abuse, failure to keep a clean kennel and other administrative violations stemming from her operation of Kelly's Pet Hotel on West Morena Boulevard. 
Brown told television and newspaper reporters last week at a county licensing hearing that she would kill if her animal license were taken from her. 
"My life isn't worth it," Brown said. "But I won't take mine alone, that's for sure." 
Deputy City Atty. Fritz Ortlieb said he wants to shut down her kennel. It was raided last week, and many animals were found sick among the feces lying around the shelter. Brown has denied that she mistreated any animal. She is being held without bail.
