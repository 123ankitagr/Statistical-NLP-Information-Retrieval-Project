"THE AGITATORS"(Hungary, 1969; Director: Deszo Magyar; Fairfax, 6:45 p.m.). In this brilliant, hurtling portrayal of the abortive 1919 Hungarian rebellion, Magyar sees the past through a contemporary '60s prism: his young revolutionaries fulminate, rage, scream and slice each other's dialectics to shreds -- caught by a restless camera and slashing, propulsive editing.
