Mayor William Thomson will try to set up a meeting in late March among Southern California city officials opposed to malathion aerial spraying. 
The Pasadena Board of Directors voted Tuesday to organize the meeting as a follow-up to its action last week banning low-altitude flights over Pasadena. City police helicopters were sent out to enforce the ordinance against helicopter pilots spraying malathion. The action prompted a meeting with Gov. George Deukmejian. 
Thomson said he would try to call a meeting March 22 or 23, when more than 300 city officials and staff members are expected to attend a Southern California Assn. of Governments meeting at the Pasadena Hilton Hotel.
