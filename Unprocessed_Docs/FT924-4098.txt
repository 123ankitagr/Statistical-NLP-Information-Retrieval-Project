CITICORP, the leading US bank that is striving to bolster its capital base,
is to sell a 7.9 per cent stake in Fomento Economic Mexicano (Femsa),
Mexico's leading beverage company. Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but
Citibank is expected to receive around Dollars 100m.
The buyer of the Femsa stake is Philip Morris, the tobacco and foods group
that is active in the Mexican beer market and owns Miller Brewing, a leading
US beermaker.
Femsa has a 49 per cent share of the Mexican beer market and is also the
country's leading Coca-Cola bottler and owner of Mexico's largest
convenience store retail chain.
Citicorp originally acquired 15 per cent of Femsa in 1988. It sold a 7.1 per
cent stake early this year.
