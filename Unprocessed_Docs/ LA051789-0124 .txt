A deal that would have created the world's largest gold company collapsed Tuesday after a New York judge refused to lift an order blocking South Africa-controlled Minorco SA from acquiring Consolidated Gold Fields PLC. 
Minorco Chief Executive Sir Michael Edwardes said his company's bid would lapse today after U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey maintained an injunction barring Minorco from buying more Gold Fields shares.
