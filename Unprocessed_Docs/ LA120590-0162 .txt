Baseball owners today gave their labor negotiators approval to make a collusion settlement with the players. 
"In essence, we can consider the collusion agreement concluded," said Chuck O'Connor, general counsel of the Players Relations Committee. "We don't have a definite document yet -- there is still some language to work out -- but we have points of agreement." 
O'Connor said the agreement will be sent to the Players Assn. and a vote is expected at the union's winter meeting in Orlando, Fla., on Thursday. 
If the proposal is approved, as expected, the owners will pay $280 million in collusion damages and 16 players will again become free agents. Among the players involved are Gary Gaetti and Dave Smith.
