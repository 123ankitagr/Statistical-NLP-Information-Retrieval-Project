MARION Merrell Dow, the US pharmaceuticals group, is looking for a
substantial pan-European acquisition, according to senior company
executives.
The aim of any acquisition would be to increase sales in its European
prescription drugs and over-the-counter non-prescription businesses. The
group generates about 30 per cent of its turnover outside the US, and about
23 per cent in Europe.
Marion Merrell Dow would also like to acquire manufacturing capacity, says
Mr Ronald Irwin, chairman and managing director of Marion Merrell Dow's UK
operations.
The group's British production site was acquired by Procter & Gamble, the US
consumer products group, when it bought Richardson-Vicks in 1986. Marion
Merrell Dow now uses contract manufacturers.
Mr Irwin says the group has considerable cash reserves to make an
acquisition. Cash and short-term investments at the end of last year were
Dollars 414m.
However, another route available to the company might be a merger. Merchant
bankers are known to have approached at least one leading British
pharmaceuticals group suggesting such a deal.
Any European acquisition would compliment Marion Merrell Dow's purchase last
year of the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals group Henning.
In 1991, the US group attempted to acquire Nicholas Labs, the European OTC
business of the US company Sara Lee, which was eventually bought by Roche of
Switzerland for Dollars 790m.
The US group needs to drive earnings through acquisitions. US patents for
its two leading products, Cardizem and Seldane, are due to expire within the
next two years.
Sales of Nicoderm, its nicotine patch, together with those of Nicorette
nicotine gum, increased 122 per cent last year. However, they are expected
to slow this year.
