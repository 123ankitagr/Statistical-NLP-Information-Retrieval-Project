Please be advised that Falana speaks as an individual with MS and not as a spokesperson for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. MS is a remarkably complex disease that, unfortunately, still has no cure and only limited treatment. In many cases the disease is progressive; in others, people will suffer severe symptoms and then return to close to their original functioning. 
The factors which contribute to the disease's course are still largely unknown. There are an estimated 250,000 people in the United States with MS and the methods they use to deal with it are as varied as the people themselves. If the disease progresses, it certainly isn't a negative reflection upon their will, faith or desire to heal. 
We hope that the day will soon arrive when we can finally put this disease to rest. 
CARL T. WHITE, Chairman, National Multiple Sclerosis Society
