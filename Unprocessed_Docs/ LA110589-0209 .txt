As strong-armed quarterback Frank Dolce goes, so goes the pass-happy offense at El Camino College. 
Saturday night at Long Beach Veterans Stadium, Dolce cranked up his right arm for 316 yards, and as a result, the El Camino scoring machine, which had been in the doldrums of late, got a jump start as well. Dolce and his fleet of talented receivers led El Camino to a 40-15 victory over host Long Beach. 
Saturday night, Dolce dipped into El Camino's aerial arsenal for these gems: 
* A first-quarter strike over the top of the Long Beach defense that was tipped by cornerback James Brown into the hands of El Camino's Khevin Pratt, who tucked the ball away for a 34-yard touchdown play. 
* A 41-yard bullet to Pratt in the second quarter that set up Louis Perez' 32-yard field goal to give El Camino a 17-7 lead. 
* A tight spiral to flanker David Blakes, who sprinted with the ball to the end zone for a 35-yard TD play with 11 seconds left in the first half. A 41-yard completion to Blakes set up Perez's 22-yarder at the start of the third quarter. 
With the victory, the Warriors improved to 8-0 overall and 7-0 in the Mission Conference. El Camino, ranked first in the state and third in the nation by JC Grid-Wire, They also took another stride toward their hopes of another undefeated season. 
The victory also extended the school's nation-best winning streak to 15 games. 
Dolce completed 21 of his 30 passes. The Warriors held Long Beach (3-5 overall) to 235 yards of total offense, and treated quarterback Damon Fisher roughly. 
Long Beach flanker Oscar Ford scored the Vikings' only two touchdowns -- one on an 84-yard kickoff return in the second quarter, and on a nine-yard pass play from replacement quarterback Steven Jones in the fourth.
