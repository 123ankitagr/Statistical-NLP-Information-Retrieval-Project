SUN Microsystems, a leading supplier of workstation computer systems, has
entered a strategic alliance with Amdahl, a California technology company
specialising in large mainframes, writes Frank McGurty in New York.
By agreeing to sell Sun's servers - used to link workstations into networks -Amdahl will broaden its product range beyond the mainframe market, which
has shown poor growth in recent years. Sun will gain access to Amdahl's
customer base of large companies.
