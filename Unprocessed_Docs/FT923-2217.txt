NON-OIL COMMODITY prices will rise by 10 per cent over the next 12 months as
the world economy slowly improves, according to Goldman Sachs, the US
investment bank.
At present supplies are restricted while demand is expected to increase, Mr
Ravi Bulchandani, the bank's senior international economist, told a
conference on commodities organised by the bank in London yesterday.
This would normally be an explosive mix - but the prospective economic
recovery was below par and would not therefore lead to the 20 or 30 per cent
price rises usually registered in such circumstances.
Commodity prices are cheap, Mr Bulchandani said. Goldman Sachs' production
cost benchmark, designed to identify a floor for commodity prices below
which there would be a tendency for supplies to contract, suggests most
non-oil commodities are being produced unprofitably, including cotton,
aluminium and grains.
