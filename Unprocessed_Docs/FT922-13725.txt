CITROEN, the French car maker, has concluded a deal, backed heavily by
French state guaranteed credits, on the financing of a FFr5.2bn (Pounds
530m) joint venture to make small family cars in the central Chinese
province of Hubei, its most ambitious project outside Europe.
The company, part of the Peugeot group, said assembly of the Citroen ZX
hatchback will begin in Hubei this year.
Initially, the car will be put together from imported French kits, at a
temporary plant in Xiangfan. Output is to rise from 12,000 units in 1993 to
37,500 units by 1997, eventually climbing to 150,000.
The French group's partner is the Dongfeng Company, the leading Chinese
truck maker which will hold 70 per cent of the joint venture. Citroen will
hold 25 per cent, with 4 per cent held by the French bank, Societe Generale,
and 1 per cent by Banque Nationale de Paris.
This is the Peugeot group's second plant in China, where it already has a
factory in the southern city of Guangzhou which produced 17,000 Peugeot
cars.
Of the initial FFr4bn first stage of the project - capacity for 37,500
vehicles annually - low-interest loans guaranteed by the French government
represent FFr1.7bn, with FFr1.2bn of buyer credits from French banks
guaranteed by Coface, the state-owned export credit guarantee agency, and
FFr1.1bn from Chinese banks.
The second stage requires FFr1.2bn of investment, covered by the partners'
contribution to the start-up capital.
