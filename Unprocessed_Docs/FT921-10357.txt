PEUGEOT TALBOT, the carmaker, is likely to introduce changes in working
practices at its Coventry plants today after workers voted by a small
majority for industrial action against them.
Fewer than 1,400 voted in the ballot to sanction industrial action short of
a strike and about 1,200 voted against. Although union leaders can legally
order action if more than half of votes are in favour of it, the likelihood
is that they will not do so at Peugeot because the majority is so narrow.
Peugeot's plans are the latest in a series of moves among carmakers to
improve productivity in the face of growing competition from Japanese
companies setting up or expanding plants in the UK. Peugeot intends to
increase production-line speeds and cut break periods.
Since first announcing its plans in early December it has indicated that the
initial target of cutting 12 minutes a day from workers' breaks will be
eased.
It is still seeking the 4 per cent increase in line speeds that it
originally sought.
The changes are aimed at increasing productivity by about 5.5 per cent,
against the 7 per cent originally envisaged. The new target would increase
weekly output of 2,120 cars by about 115.
Peugeot would not comment yesterday on its plans. In the past, it has said
the changes would not put pressure on the hardest-working employees. Work
would be reorganised at points on the line where pressure was greatest,
although overall the number of workers would not be increased.
The changes will affect about 2,500 of the 3,500 hourly paid Peugeot
workforce. The company employs 6,000, including managers and white-collar
staff.
Peugeot originally planned to introduce the changes at the beginning of this
year. It says that the present 42 minutes each day for tea breaks is
inconsistent with the rest of the motor manufacturing industry. Other
carmakers seeking agreements to change working practices from their
workforces include Rover and Vauxhall.
