Suspense story: a footbridge is hoisted into place across the River Aire in
Leeds. It is the first new river crossing in the city for over 100 years.
The Pounds 400,000 bridge is part of the development of Leeds Waterfront, an
area of former derelict warehouses. It will link the city centre with the
planned Royal Armouries Museum and Tetley brewery museum and stables
