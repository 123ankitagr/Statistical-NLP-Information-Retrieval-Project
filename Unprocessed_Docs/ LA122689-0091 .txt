A fire killed a mother and her three young children, and investigators were trying to determine whether it started in the living room, where the family's Christmas tree stood. 
All died of burns from the Christmas Eve blaze. 
"It was a tragic, tragic situation. The firefighters were carrying the children out with tears in their eyes," Fire Chief Norman Chaput said.
