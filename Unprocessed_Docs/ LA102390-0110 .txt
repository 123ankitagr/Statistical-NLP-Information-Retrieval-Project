Kemper Released From Hospital: Great American Bank Chairman Robert Kemper, who collapsed during a special shareholders meeting Thursday to approve the sale of the ailing thrift's 130 California branches to Wells Fargo, was released from Sharp Memorial Hospital late Friday afternoon, an S&L official said. Kemper underwent a series of "precautionary tests" after admission to the hospital Thursday but the S&L would not discuss what sorts of tests or the reasons for Kemper's collapse.
