Norman Lamont, 51, who lost his job as Britain's chancellor of the exchequer
last May, has picked up his first company chairmanship. He is to head a
small investment trust being set up to invest in the Taiwanese stock market.
Lamont, who worked as a fund manager at merchant bankers N M Rothschild
before entering politics, has been appointed chairman of the Taiwan
Investment Trust which is due to be launched next month by the Jupiter
Tyndall Group. It will be the first closed-end investment company in Europe
investing exclusively in Taiwan and the plan is to raise Pounds 30m.
Lamont, who was appointed a non-executive director of N M Rothschild shortly
after quitting the government, is already on the board of Jupiter Tyndall's
First Philippine Investment Trust.
