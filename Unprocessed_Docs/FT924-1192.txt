THE government yesterday moved to tackle a fraud over student grant
applications. The Department for Education said it was in touch with all
London local education authorities about false claims.
Council leaders called in police after discovering thousands of faked grant
applications in London, with an average claim worth about Pounds 4,000.
Further cases are suspected in the home counties and other cities, including
Manchester.
The department has advised town halls how to stop fraudulent claims and
recover cash paid out. 'We are considering sending out further advice on how
to combat this kind of fraud to all authorities across the country,' it
said.
The London Borough of Brent said police and internal auditors were
investigating up to 200 bogus grant applications, which would have cost
Pounds 2.4m over three years - the equivalent of a Pounds 20 per head
increase in poll tax bills.
Other boroughs in the capital believed to be hit include Waltham Forest,
Kensington and Chelsea, Redbridge, Islington, Westminster and Camden.
