GREENPEACE has started criminal proceedings against ICI, Britain's largest
chemicals company, alleging the company released pollutants into the Irish
Sea without a permit.
Magistrates at Halton, Cheshire, have issued what Greenpeace says is the
first private summons under section 85 of the Water Resources Act 1991.
ICI is alleged to have released organochlorines, a class of chemicals which
include some poisons, from its Hillhouse site near Fleetwood, Lancashire, on
May 15. 'We are currently investigating the matter and consulting our
lawyers,' the company said.
