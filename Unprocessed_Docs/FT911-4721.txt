TT GROUP, the industrial holding company which last year won a five-month
battle for Crystalate, has launched a Pounds 6.8m hostile bid for Magnetic
Materials, the USM-quoted maker of magnetic components.
The 37p per share bid was rejected by Magnetic yesterday as 'derisory,
unsolicited, unwelcome and totally inadequate'.
It was below the market price, which closed down 2p at 41p, and at a
substantial discount to last June's net asset value of 61.8p per share.
More than 40 per cent of Magnetic's shares lie in the hands of Mr Eduard
Michaelis, the non-executive deputy chairman, and his family. Mr Michaelis,
who will be 90 on May 19, was replaced as chairman by Mr George Doust in
January.
The company's pre-tax profit fell to Pounds 220,000 (Pounds 704,000) in the
six months to December 31 on turnover of Pounds 7.3m (Pounds 8.3m). Mr John
Emmanuel, chief executive, said yesterday that things were 'coming right'
and the management was confident about the future.
TT already controls 16.2 per cent of the equity, having bought a 9.4 per
cent stake at 37p on Tuesday, 2p above this year's low point.
Mr Nicholas Shipp, a TT director, described the market price of the shares
as notional because there was so little trade.
He said Magnetic was providing a dismal return on net assets of about Pounds
11m. It had a similar customer base to Crystalate, the maker of electronic
components acquired in a Pounds 34m deal completed last September.
TT, which increased pre-tax profit by 25 per cent to Pounds 10.5m in 1990 on
sales of Pounds 100.3m, had year-end gearing of 40 per cent, which would
rise to 50 per cent if the Magnetic bid went through at the current offer
price.
In November, TT raised Pounds 9.7m in an issue of convertible preference
shares. Its market value at yesterday's closing price of 134p was Pounds
95.2m.
