Sprint, PacBell Offer 800 Service: US Sprint and Pacific Bell said they will join forces, if California regulators approve, to provide national toll-free calling for commercial customers. The deal would enable businesses wishing to establish toll-free service to call either US Sprint or Pacific Bell instead of having to arrange the local and long-distance portion of their network separately.
