FORD is investing Pounds 14m to consolidate all its European sparkplug
production at its Treforest plant in south Wales.
About 100 employees will transfer to Treforest from Ford's engine
manufacturing facility at nearby Bridgend, where about 50 jobs had been
scheduled to be lost as part of a series of cuts throughout all Ford's UK
plants.
The move means the end of sparkplug production at Ford's Enfield plant,
north London, where Pounds 4.5m will be invested in substitute activities.
