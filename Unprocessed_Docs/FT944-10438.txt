Intel, the leading supplier of microprocessors to the personal computer
industry, expects demand for its Pentium chip to increase at an aggressive
rate in 1995, AP-DJ reports from New York.
Mr Gerhard Parker, senior vice-president, general manager, of the technology
and manufacturing group of Intel, said he also expected the PC market to
continue growing.
He said the company expected 486 chip demand to fall off as popularity for
the Pentium increases.
