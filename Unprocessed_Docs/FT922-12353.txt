A HELICOPTER crash on a North Sea oil rig which killed six men in July 1990
was the pilot's fault, an inquiry report ruled yesterday.
The helicopter hit a crane on the Shell oil installation Brent Spar and
plunged into the sea killing the pilot, his co-pilot and four oilmen.
Sheriff Douglas Risk said Captain David Anderton made his approach in such a
way that the tail rotor was pointing towards the crane, which was out of his
sight.
