The $5,000 prize for best jazz song in the first Billboard Song Contest has gone to Ron Robbins of Irvine. Robbins' song, "Montego," was picked by jazz-pop stars George Benson and George Duke, the two judges in the jazz category. 
"Montego" now goes up against the winners in six other categories in the competition for a $25,000 grand prize. Judges will come from a panel that includes David Foster, Roy Clark, Quincy Jones, Julio Iglesias and Tammy Wynette, in addition to Benson and Duke. The winner will be announced next month, said contest spokesman Craig Melone. 
Melone said the 1988 contest, sponsored by Billboard magazine, received thousands of entries in each category. The contest is open to anyone who earns less than an average of $5,000 a year from songwriting.
