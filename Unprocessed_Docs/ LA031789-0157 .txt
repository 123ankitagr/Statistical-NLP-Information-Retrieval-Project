The son of Vincennes commander Capt. Will Rogers III has been moved off campus from his Colgate University dormitory so that Navy bodyguards can protect him from possible terrorist attacks. 
The Vincennes was the Navy cruiser that accidentally downed an Iranian passenger jet in July. Security at the upstate New York university has been heightened in the week since a bomb exploded in a van driven by the captain's wife, Sharon Lee Rogers, in San Diego, said Colgate spokesman James Leach. 
Will Rogers IV, a Colgate sophomore, and Navy officials declined to discuss the security measures. Students at the university said the younger Rogers is accompanied by two to four bodyguards whenever he is on the campus.
