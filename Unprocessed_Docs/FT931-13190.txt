PEUGEOT aims to increase its share of a falling European market this year,
after losing ground in its home base of France in 1992, Mr Jacques Calvet,
president, claimed yesterday.
Mr Calvet said that his company would this year have the new models to
launch under both its Peugeot and Citroen brands that it lacked last year
and that therefore its share of the west European car market should rise to
about 13 per cent from the 12.2 per cent of last year.
He gave no indication of the Peugeot results for 1992, after a first half in
which the company reported profits of FFr2.3bn, (Dollars 420m) down from
FFr2.7bn in the same period of 1991.
However, Mr Calvet estimated that overall west European car sales would be 5
per cent lower this year than last year, following an unpromising start this
month.
He was not as pessimistic as the CEA, the European carmaker association,
which was predicting a 7.5 per cent in European car sales this year.
However, Mr Calvet characteristically predicted that the European Commission
would have great difficulty in reaching agreement with Japan on the latter's
car exports to the community.
