DR Bernard Kouchner, above, the French health and humanitarian affairs
minister, yesterday accused French doctors of writing bogus sick notes for
prison guards, enabling them to continue the strike which has paralysed
French jails, Reuter reports from Paris. 'One doctor filled out 31
certificates and many wrote out a dozen certificates each,' said Dr
Kouchner.
