1985:             North Korea signs nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty                  (NPT) but refuses to sign safeguards pact to allow                  International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) inspection. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1991:             North, under mounting pressure, says it will allow                  inspection as soon as US begins removing nuclear                  weapons from South Korea; South declares there no                  nuclear weapons on its soil;  two Koreas                  agree to ban nuclear weapons and hold talks to                  ensure compliance. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1992:             North signs safeguards agreement; IAEA says after                  visit to Yongbyon complex that North is moving                  ahead with programme that could produce weapons-grade                  plutonium. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, Jan-May:    Talks between two Koreas on mutual inspections                  collapses; North says it will pull out of                  NPT; IAEA rules North has violated nuclear accords;                  UN Security Council calls on North to open                  sites; US and North agree to talk. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1993, June-Nov:   North agrees to suspend withdrawal from NPT and to                  renew talks with IAEA; inspectors report that access                  to two sites still restricted; North says it will                  not yield and is prepared to suffer sanctions or even                  war. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994, Jan-May:    After further talks with US, North agrees to                  inspection of seven declared sites; South says                  North hampering inspectors at Yongbyon and North,                  saying confrontation could lead to war, walks out                  of meeting with South; US decides to deploy Patriot                  missiles to South; North invites inspectors to                  Yongbyon but rejects taking of samples. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
1994, June-Oct:   US says it will seek UN sanctions and sends former                  President Jimmy Carter to negotiate with North's                  President Kim Il-sung; US agrees to talks with                  North in Geneva after Carter receives assurances                  from North; Kim dies but North soon agrees to                  resume talks with US; talks are difficult, but,                  after many weeks, agreement is reached. -----------------------------------------------------------------------
