Sir, Mr J A Nightingale, chairman of the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles
Alliance, calls (Letters, November 30) on developing countries to lift their
barriers to textiles and clothing in exchange for the phasing-out of the
Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA).
The MFA is a legalised derogation from the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, imposed on developing countries as a 'temporary measure' 20 years
ago. Imposing unilateral restrictions and then using them as a bargaining
chip to get access to developing nations' markets amounts to heavy-handed
tactics, not at all conducive to good trading relations.
At Punta del Este, to which Mr Nightingale refers, governments in fact
agreed to ensure that developing countries received 'differential and more
favourable treatment'. Their declaration stated: 'Developed countries do not
expect reciprocity in their reduction of barriers to trade to developing
countries, that is they do not expect developing countries to make
contributions which are inconsistent with the individual development,
financial and trade needs.'
Ending the MFA is one of the few benefits which the Gatt proposal offers
developing countries. Diluting those gains by further extending the MFA or
pressing for yet more reciprocal actions - options which President Clinton
is now exploring - would seriously undermine their economic prospects.
Mr Nightingale is right to call for serious bargaining. But surely, instead
of trying to wring yet more concessions out of poor countries, his industry
would do better to focus on the tariffs ranging from 35 to 60 per cent
imposed on European textiles by South Africa, Australia or the US.
