The amount of tax written off by the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise
has mounted steeply during the recession, according to the National Audit
Office.
The Inland Revenue wrote off Pounds 1.7bn last year, almost double the
figure for 1991. More than three-quarters of the total is accounted for by
insolvency. Customs & Excise wrote off Pounds 825m of value added tax and
customs duties as either remitted or irrecoverable last year, up from Pounds
553m in 1991. Most of this is also because of insolvency.
