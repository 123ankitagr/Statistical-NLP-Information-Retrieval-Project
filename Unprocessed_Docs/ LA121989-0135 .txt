The sponsor of the Proposition 103 insurance initiative today said it would try to put a measure on the November, 1990, ballot that would create a state insurance agency to replace private auto insurers. 
Voter Revolt's proposed California Auto Plan would kick in if industry insurance averages show by Sept. 1, 1991, that rates have not been reduced to 20% below 1987 levels and if more than 15% of motorists are uninsured. 
"Our message to the insurance companies is, 'Obey Prop. 103 or we're going to kick your butts out of the state of California,' " Voter Revolt chief Harvey Rosenfield said at a morning news conference.
