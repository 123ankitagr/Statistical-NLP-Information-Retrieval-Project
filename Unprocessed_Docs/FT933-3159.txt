GENERAL MOTORS, the US carmaker, is looking to acquire one or several
Japanese parts makers to increase sales of components in the Japanese
market.
Mr Philip Austin, vice-president of GM's Automotive Components Group in
Japan, said the company could acquire several small components makers or a
larger company. 'To be a strong player in any market you need a
manufacturing presence and we don't have one in Japan.'
Although acquisitions of Japanese companies by foreign groups have been
rare, Mr Austin said the timing was good as many Japanese car parts
suppliers had suffered from the economic downturn. 'Their investments in the
US have become a burden and they are overcommitted in Japan with borrowings,
so opportunities obviously exist.'
GM's move reflects its growing interest in developing its Asian operations.
The components division, which sells more than 70 per cent of its product to
the parent company, is working to reduce its dependence on the North
American market to 50 per cent of revenues by the year 2000.
US and Japanese negotiators meet in Hawaii next week to discuss encouraging
Japanese purchases of US car and car parts in an effort to reduce Japan's
huge trade surplus. US-made car parts have been more successful in the
Japanese market than US cars.
GM sells more than twice as much in components in Japan than it does in
cars, and Mr Austin said GM expects sales to Japanese carmakers to reach
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.2bn) globally by 1998, compared with Dollars 900m last
year.
