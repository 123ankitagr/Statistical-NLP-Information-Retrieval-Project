Despa Fonds, a German investment institution, has paid Pounds 104m for the
London headquarters building of retail group John Lewis, Andrew Taylor
writes.
The John Lewis headquarters at 171 Victoria Street was acquired from BfG
Bank of Frankfurt.
The purchase was described by Richard Ellis, commercial estate agents, as
'the biggest West End investment deal for many years'.
It is the second large commercial property purchase to be announced by
German institution in less than a week.
Electricity Supply Nominees, the electricity industry pension fund, on
Monday announced that it had sold for Pounds 106m a City of London office to
Deutsche Immobilien Fonds (DIFA).
The John Lewis headquarters building was constructed in 1975 and has an
unexpired lease of 37 years. The original tenant was BP Oil.
