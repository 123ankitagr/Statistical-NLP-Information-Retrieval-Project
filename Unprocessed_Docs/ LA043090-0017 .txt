In response to "Disney Firm Neighbors Are Gumpy and Happy," Metro, April 22: 
Although the Seven Dwarfs imagery employed on the new Walt Disney Co. headquarters building in Burbank does not emulate the graph-paper style of our present day architectural mode, it is charming kitsch and is historically appropriate to Southern California. 
The new Disney building facade is a welcome bas-relief!
