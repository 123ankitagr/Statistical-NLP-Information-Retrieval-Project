An 8-year-old Los Angeles boy who alerted his father to four men who were entering a neighbor's house received a Certificate of Appreciation this week from the Board of Police Commissioners. 
Jason Graisa, whose actions last September resulted in the arrest of the four, was honored in front of family, friends and police officials at a Parker Center ceremony. He is the youngest person to be given the certificate, the highest award for bravery that the commission gives private citizens.
