An Oxnard man who was convicted on rape charges in Pennsylvania was arrested at his apartment Friday. 
Albert Russell Morris, 31, was taken into custody at 5:50 a.m. by FBI agents and Oxnard police and charged with federal unlawful flight to avoid confinement. 
Morris was found guilty last year on one charge each of rape and statutory rape in Allegheny County, Pa., said Gary Auer, FBI supervisory special agent. 
When Morris failed to appear for sentencing, a federal warrant for his arrest was issued, charging him with unlawful flight. 
The FBI learned Morris was in Oxnard after he was arrested Feb. 20 and charged with being under the influence of a controlled substance. 
FBI investigators matched Morris' fingerprints taken during his arrest in Oxnard with those taken in Pennsylvania and traced him to his Oxnard apartment, Auer said. 
Morris is being held at the Ventura County Jail. The federal unlawful flight charges will be dismissed and Morris will be returned to Pennsylvania, where he will face sentencing on the two rape charges, Auer said. KIM KASH
