Manchester United, the quoted football club, has come up with a novel way of
publicising its most valuable collection of intangible assets - its players -without putting such delicate items on its balance sheet.
It has hired accountants Touche Ross to give an independent valuation of its
22-strong first team, plus 15 young professionals. They reckon the squad's
worth Pounds 24m. Looked at another way, investors own 197p of player for
every share held. This is in addition to the conventional net asset backing
of 344p and means that the shares, at 289p, should remain well outside the
penalty box.
Touche's credentials lie in its aptly named Touche Ross Football Industry
Team, captained by Gerry Boon. He says it's illogical for clubs to spend a
lot of money on players - United's first-team squad cost Pounds 17m to put
together, leaving aside the home-grown talent - and not to recognise their
value.
