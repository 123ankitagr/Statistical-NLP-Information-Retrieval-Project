Sir, Diane Summers reports 'Saatchi raps 'sloppy' advertising industry' (May
11), in particular the blandness and misconception of most global
advertising campaigns. This would be valued criticism were it not for the
fact that Saatchi and Saatchi was itself the arch proponent of the global
'one brand one campaign' movement throughout the 1980s. If Maurice Saatchi
really wants to speak in 'simple universally recognised truths', he could
start by acknowledging this error of judgment.
Another part of his speech suggests that advertisers seeking these truths
may yet be hard pushed to discover them. Mr Saatchi bemoans the fact that
advertising is no longer seen as 'part of that virtuous circle, in which the
gift that advertising bestows - a premium price - is asked to provide funds
to re-invest in superior product quality, innovation, product development. .
.'
This is the advertising industry inflating its ego again. The truth is
advertising should reflect company philosophy, not be a substitute for it.
For example, financial services spent nearly Pounds 1bn on advertising over
five years in the 1980s. These advertisers and their agencies conspired to
substitute 'sexy' advertising for basic improvements in service, clarity and
value. They failed. Belatedly, financial institutions are looking to their
product and their service first.
Advertising is simply a communication tool (often a blunt one at that) and
one of a number available to advertisers. The sooner the industry recognises
that the better. Bob Edwards,
