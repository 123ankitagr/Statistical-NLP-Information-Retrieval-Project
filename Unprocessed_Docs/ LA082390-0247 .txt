Actor Sean Connery will receive a rare award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for his "outstanding contribution to world cinema," the academy announced today. 
Connery, who played James Bond in seven films until 1983 before moving on to other roles, will be only the third recipient of the academy's Tribute Award. The previous winners were Dirk Bogarde and Julie Andrews. Princess Anne, the academy's president, will present the award to Connery at a party in London in October. 
Connery, who was born in an Edinburgh tenement, turns 60 Saturday and remains one of the world's top box-office draws. He won the 1988 Oscar for best supporting actor in "The Untouchables"
