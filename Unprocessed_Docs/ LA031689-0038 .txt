Convicted mass murderer Charles Manson was transferred this week from San Quentin to the state's toughest, new maximum-security section at Corcoran State Prison near Tulare, a corrections officer disclosed. Lt. Evelyn Mazon said the 52-year-old Manson is one of 957 high-risk prisoners that have been moved to Corcoran from other prisons since the facility opened early last year. The prisons at Folsom, San Quentin and Tehachapi are closing their maximum-security units.
