A strike planned for Wednesday by British railway signal staff could
severely disrupt train services for the third time in as many weeks. The
staff are staging weekly one day strikes over a complex pay and productivity
deal. Railtrack, which operates the rail infrastructure has been able to run
only limited services during both of the previous one day strikes.
