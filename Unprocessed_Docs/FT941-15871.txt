A sharp fall in energy costs - reflecting lower world oil prices - led to a
decline in US producer prices for finished goods last month, the third fall
in the past six months, the Commerce Department reported yesterday.
The 'core' producer price index, which excludes the volatile components of
food and energy, rose 0.2 per cent between November and December, indicating
that underlying inflationary pressures remain moderate at the wholesale
level.
For 1993 as a whole, producer prices rose 0.2 per cent, against 1.6 per cent
in 1992. Core producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last year, the smallest
increase since the index was first calculated in 1974.
The index for 'intermediate' goods, which gives advance warning of likely
trends in prices for finished goods, was also subdued, falling 0.2 per cent
last month and rising by 1 per cent during 1993.
Most analysts expect inflationary pressures to remain modest this year.
Merrill Lynch, the New York investment house, yesterday predicted producer
prices would rise by about 1 per cent this year.
However JP Morgan, the New York bank, struck a cautious note, warning that
'idle capacity is close to levels associated with rising inflation in the
past.'
