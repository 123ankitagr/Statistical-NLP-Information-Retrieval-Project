A campaign to introduce legislation to cut the amount of road traffic was
launched yesterday by Friends of the Earth, the Green party and Plaid Cymru.
The organisations are seeking all-party support for a Traffic Reduction Bill
to stabilise road traffic volumes at 1990 levels by 2000 and to reduce them
by 10 per cent 2010.
They plan to put down an early-day motion later this week to build support
both locally and nationally and hope to persuade an MP successful in the
private members' ballot to put forward a bill later in the year.
