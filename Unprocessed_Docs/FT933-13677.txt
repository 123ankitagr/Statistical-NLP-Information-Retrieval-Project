Rothschild Asset Management has changed the name of its New Court unit
trusts and restructured the charges. Since July 15, the New Court name has
been replaced by Five Arrows, a name derived from the Rothschild crest. The
name has been in use in other parts of the world for some time. The initial
charge for unit trusts was reduced from 6 per cent to 5.25 per cent on July
15, and the annual charge will be increased from 1.25 per cent to 1.5 per
cent from October 14.
