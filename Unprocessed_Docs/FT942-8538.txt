Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing, speaking at an international business
conference in Singapore, described his country as growing fast but still a
low-income land at least two generations away from the medium level of
development, Reuter reports from Singapore. He said China lagged behind
because of the huge population, weak economic base, uneven development and
disparity between urban and rural areas.
As China sticks to reform and opens up, he said, 'the enormous potential for
attracting foreign capital into China will be tapped more quickly and
effectively, making available tremendous opportunities for foreign business
people.'
