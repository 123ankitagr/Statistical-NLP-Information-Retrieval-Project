Is there a possibility of violence in your boomers versus busters scenario? The very names are charged and explosive: "boomer," "buster," "buster," "boomer." Can civil war be very far off? 
How much time will pass before it is parents against child, brother against older brother (grandparents being the first casualties because they either insist upon neutrality or else can't get out of the line of fire fast enough)?
