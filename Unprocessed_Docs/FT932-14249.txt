SENIOR partners in Swiss law firms are the best paid commercial lawyers in
Europe, earning an average of Dollars 490,000, according to a survey by the
International Financial Law Review. Partners in German firms are the next
best paid, earning on average Dollars 465,000, followed by senior partners
in UK firms earning an average of Dollars 440,000. Ignoring averages and
looking for the highest paid lawyers overall, the IFLR says partners in
German commercial law firms come top. Senior partners in Frankfurt firms are
reputed to earn about Dollars 840,000 a year, it says, with the highest paid
partners earning as much as Dollars 1.2m.
The highest paid partners in top City firms are said to earn up to Dollars
825,000. Over the past few years partners have seen their profits stagnate
and salary rises for associate solicitors have been minimal, one managing
partner of a City firm told IFLR. Bringing up the rear are Portugal and
Greece where partners earn on average Dollars 165,000 and Dollars 125,000
respectively.
