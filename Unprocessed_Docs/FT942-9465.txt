The Department of Trade and Industry will today announce the results of a
consultation exercise which examined how the government should deal with the
issue of supermarket 'lookalike' products.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, the junior minister responsible for technology, has
been asking brand manufacturers if they believe protection for brand names
against lookalikes should be offered in amendments to the trademarks bill,
or whether new legislation on fair trading would be more appropriate.
The British Producers and Brand Owners Group, whose members include
Coca-Cola, Colgate Palmolive, Gillette, Mars, Nestle and Procter & Gamble,
has persuaded Mr Hugh Bayley, Labour MP for York, to put down an amendment
to the trademarks bill which would offer brand names extra protection.
As the bill now stands, trademarks are defined primarily by name and logo.
The amendment clarifies the definition of trademarks to include the shape,
design and overall packaging of a brand.
The bill will go to committee stage tomorrow. Mr Bayley said he did not
'realistically expect the amendment to get into the bill', but hoped it
would encourage government debate of the issue.
