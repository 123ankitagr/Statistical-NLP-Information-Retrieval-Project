THE OSLO bourse, struggling to recoup trading volume lost to foreign stock
markets, is to extend its trading session by one hour to 4pm.
The extension, which takes effect from May 3, will initially apply to shares
and share derivatives.
The aim is to strengthen Oslo's competitive position in relation to trade in
Norwegian shares, the bourse said.
In recent years, London has become the alternative market for Norwegian
shares. London member-firms reported composite trading in Norwegian shares
worth Pounds 4.94bn (Dollars 7.08m) for 1992, compared with NKr63bn (Dollars
8.88m) in Oslo.
On London's Seaq exchange, turnover reached Pounds 4.1bn last year on 22
Norwegian shares, against NKr30.1bn in Oslo.
