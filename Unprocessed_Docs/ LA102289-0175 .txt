Southern Californians donated so much blood in the days after Tuesday's earthquake in Northern California that Los Angeles area Red Cross officials are asking people to delay further donations until later in the year, when shortages often occur. 
"I am really so proud of Southern California. They responded in such a fantastic way," said Barbara Wilks, a Red Cross spokeswoman. 
By Friday, donations from Southern California had doubly replenished supplies of some blood types the Red Cross had sent to the San Francisco area, Wilks said. She said the Red Cross never turns away potential donors, but said that with supplies of blood for the earthquake crisis under control, donors would be better off helping the local supply later in the year. 
San Francisco area hospitals had anticipated a huge demand for blood after the quake, but actual injuries were fewer than expected.
