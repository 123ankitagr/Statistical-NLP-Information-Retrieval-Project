Cerritos 
Councilwoman Ann B. Joynt, who led the balloting in City Council elections two weeks ago, is the city's new mayor. 
Joynt, 50, who is beginning her second council term, was elected unanimously as mayor Wednesday night at the council's reorganization meeting. 
Joynt, a former high school teacher, is executive director of the U.S. Academic Decathlon, which has headquarters in Cerritos. 
The council selected Paul W. Bowlen as vice mayor. Bowlen, 49, a teacher at Cerritos High School, was elected to the council two years ago. 
As mayor, Joynt replaces Diana Needham, who was prohibited from seeking reelection this year by a 1987 City Charter amendment limiting council members to two consecutive terms. Veteran Councilman Barry Rabbitt was also barred from seeking reelection. 
Two newly elected council members -- John Crawley and Sherman Kappe -- were sworn in at the meeting. Crawley, 47, is a financial analyst with Atlantic Richfield Corp. Kappe, 45, is a former planning commissioner. He is a residential property owner and manager. 
La Mirada 
In Tuesday night's meeting, the City Council selected Lou Piltz to succeed Art Leslie as mayor. The mayor pro tem will be Bob Chotiner. 
Piltz, a retired maintenance manager for Lucky supermarkets, joined the council in 1978. He has been mayor twice previously during his four terms in office. 
Council elections were called off when no one opposed the incumbents. As a result, Piltz, Wayne Rew and Art Leslie will begin new four-year terms.
