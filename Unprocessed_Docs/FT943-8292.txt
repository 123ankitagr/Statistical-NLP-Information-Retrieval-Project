A property developer who cheated building societies out of almost Pounds 2m
to achieve his boyhood dream of owning a set of commercial buildings in his
home town of Basingstoke was jailed for two years yesterday.
Mr Montague Alexander, 50, built up The Warren complex, Winchester Crown
Court heard. He ran up large debts, however, and tricked building societies
into handing over money.
Mr Alexander admitted eight offences of obtaining money by deception from
four building societies. He asked for 18 similar offences to be considered.
