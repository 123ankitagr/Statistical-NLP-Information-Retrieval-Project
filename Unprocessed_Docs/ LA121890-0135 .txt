Snarled traffic and a few fender-benders accompanied the sellout crowd at Anaheim Stadium for the Los Angeles Rams' Monday night football game against the San Francisco 49ers. 
"It was extremely congested for a long time," said Anaheim Police Lt. Ray Welch. 
"There were a lot of late arrivals because of the traffic." 
Welch said the stadium parking filled to capacity, along with several nearby lots, forcing many spectators to park "a greater distance away" than during most Rams games. He said there were several vehicle mishaps, but no major accidents. 
Six additional officers were stationed in the stadium area to contend with the football traffic and rush-hour gridlock. 
Police Sgt. Richard Zschache said the extra officers were on duty to keep traffic moving. They were stationed at entry and exit points of the stadium. 
"When the stadium lots fill up, we get a lot of people trying to make turns from the middle lane of traffic when they see a parking space," Zschache said. "We are prepared for that." 
Earlier in the day, police were advising motorists to steer clear of the stadium-area freeways and streets before game time if travel wasn't necessary. Traffic began to build up about 3:30 p.m. 
"It's just like other Monday night games," Zschache said. "There are more cars on the road because people are leaving work to come to the game and don't have time to go home and pick up their friends."
