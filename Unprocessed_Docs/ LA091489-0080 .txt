The football teams at Azusa Pacific University and Occidental entered the season with high expectations. 
But both teams will enter their Saturday non-conference match-up at 1:30 p.m. in Azusa still looking for their first win of the season. 
Azusa Pacific, which had been ranked No. 22 in the first National Assn. of Intercollegiate Athletics Division II poll, suffered a 24-6 defeat to the University of San Diego last week and Occidental lost to Menlo, 16-14. 
In its loss to San Diego, Azusa struggled on offense with only 133 total yards and coach Jim Milhon said the Cougars were hurt by mental mistakes on defense. However, two players who turned in outstanding games on defense were linebackers Jeff Gustin and Phil Heppner. 
Occidental was led on offense against Menlo by running back Steve McClaskey, a former player for Azusa Pacific who rushed for 109 yards and one touchdown. Another leader for Occidental is quarterback Tony Werbelow, who played at Arcadia High.
