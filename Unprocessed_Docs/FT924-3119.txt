London COCOA took a sudden dive on what traders said was fund liquidation.
After ending the morning with moderate losses, the market plunged after the
New York March contract breached first Dollars 1,000 and then Dollars 980 in
early trading. 'A significant trend line was broken in London, precipitating
the sell off here,' said a commission house trader. 'The fall was
exaggerated by sell stops because there is no fundamental news out today.' A
London trader said that people had got 'rather complacent really. We're
going to need something quite new to shake up some buying.' New York arabica
COFFEE prices were lower at midsession, but holding support after a rise in
warehouse stocks. London's March robusta contract fell back below Dollars
1,000 a tonne. 'Both London and New York are looking to consolidate but
London is running into more origin selling,' one dealer said. Three-month
NICKEL advanced further on the LME, but profit taking and chart selling were
evident above Dollars 6,000.
