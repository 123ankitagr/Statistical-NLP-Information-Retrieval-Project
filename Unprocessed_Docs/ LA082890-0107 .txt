Fidelity Federal Buys Two Thrifts: Citadel Holding Corp. in Glendale said its subsidiary, Fidelity Federal Bank, acquired from the Resolution Trust Corp. the deposits and some assets of two troubled thrifts, including Los Angeles-based Westwood S&L, whose failure is being probed by the FBI. 
Fidelity Federal acquired about $350 million of Westwood's deposits and $220 million in deposits of Investment Federal S&L, which was based in Chatsworth. The RTC said that after the sale and the disposition of the thrift's remaining assets, bailing out Westwood will cost the taxpayer-funded agency $259.5 million. Investment Federal's bailout will cost the RTC $10.4 million.
