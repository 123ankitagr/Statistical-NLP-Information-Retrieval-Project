The Campaign for Rent Reform, which wants to see the reform of commercial
leases, is aiming to collect at least 5,000 letters of protest from
businesses struggling because of current rent levels.
The letters, which will be sent to MPs, will call for the end of 'upward
only' rent reviews.
Camforr is also campaigning for a change in the law so that previous tenants
are no longer liable for the rent if a future tenant goes out of business.
