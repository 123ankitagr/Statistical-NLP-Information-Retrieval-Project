EC Farm Ministers to Lift Beef Bans: European Community agriculture ministers reached agreement on tighter measures to curb "mad cow" disease and France, West Germany and Italy agreed to lift their bans on British beef imports. After an all-night emergency meeting, British minister John Gummer told reporters the bans, imposed because of concern that the cattle brain disease affects human health, would be lifted. Diplomats said the agreement, in classic Community style, would allow all sides to claim victory.
