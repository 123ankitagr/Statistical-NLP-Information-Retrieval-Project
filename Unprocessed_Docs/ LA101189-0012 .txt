About 12,000 gallons of sewage spilled into San Diego Bay on Tuesday when rocks and debris blocked a sewer main, causing sewage to overflow a manhole on Georgia Street near the Imperial Beach-San Diego boundary. 
The 11 a.m. spill continued for two hours, according to the county Department of Health Services. 
The sewage flowed into a storm drain and emptied into the southern tip of San Diego Bay. About 200 feet of shore was contaminated, and the area has been posted as hazardous while water samples are taken.
