THE US and North Korea have agreed to reopen high-level talks in Geneva on
July 14 on nuclear and other issues, according to South Korean officials, AP
reports from Seoul.
This would follow a visit by President Bill Clinton to Seoul on July 10-11.
The Geneva talks have been called to follow up on earlier high-level contact
during which Pyongyang reversed an earlier decision and agreed to remain a
signatory to the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty.
The North did not say anything then, however, about reopening its facilities
to international inspections. The North allowed four inspections in 1992 but
refused to accommodate a demand to inspect two facilities suspected of being
nuclear waste dumps.
Mr Han Sung-joo, South Korean foreign minister, said on Sunday the North's
nuclear issues would top the agenda in the talks between Mr Clinton and
South Korean President Kim Young-sam.
North Korea, a hard-line Marxist state, is suspected of developing nuclear
weapons, despite its denials.
