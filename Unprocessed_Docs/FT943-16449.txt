The current strength of the D-Mark points to investors' confidence in the
Bundesbank monetary policy, Mr Otmar Issing, the German central bank's chief
economist and member of its policy-making council, said yesterday. Mr Issing
blamed the explosion in the growth of M3 money supply since last year on
'special factors' such as tax changes and market turmoil. Following the cut
in the German discount rate in May, circumstances were such that there would
probably be a gradual reduction in the 'liquidity blockage' which had given
rise to the high M3 growth, he said. His comments suggest that the
Bundesbank is not likely to change its reliance on M3 at its July 21 review
of monetary developments, although some economists have cast doubt on the
credibility of the central bank's monetary policy as it has cut interest
rates at a time when M3 growth is running at more than twice its 4-6 per
cent target rate for the year. In May M3 grew at an annualised, seasonally
adjusted rate of 13.7 per cent.
