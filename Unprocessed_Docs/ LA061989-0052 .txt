Tony Lopez knocked down Tyrone Jackson three times in the eighth round at Stateline, Nev., to retain his International Boxing Federation junior lightweight title. 
Referee Carlos Padilla stopped the fight with 14 seconds left in the round after Lopez (33-1, 23 knockouts) dropped Jackson (30-2) with a body shot following a flurry of unanswered punches. 
Lopez, who was ahead on all cards, rocked Jackson at the final bell in the seventh round, then had the challenger in almost immediate trouble in the eighth.
