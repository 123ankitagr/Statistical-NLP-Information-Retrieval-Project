FORD Motor Company has agreed to set up a Dollars 90m joint venture with
Shanghai's Yafeng Accessories Factory to produce plastic car parts for
China's fast-growing automotive industry.
Ford is contributing half the investment for the plant, which will be built
in Pudong, Shanghai's new development zone on the east bank of the city's
Huangpu river. China has more than 4,000 auto parts plants, mostly
inefficient and resource-consuming.
'The joint project is still at its preliminary stage,' said Mr John Emmert
of Ford's Beijing office, 'but this market certainly looks encouraging.'
Ford's investment in Shanghai reflects intense and growing interest among
foreign carmakers in the China market.
Last year, China's car output reached a record 1.8m vehicles - roughly the
monthly output of General Motors. China aims to produce 3m vehicles a year,
65 per cent of which would be sedan cars, Mr Cai Shiqing, general manager of
China National Automotive Industry Corporation, was quoted as saying this
week by the official New China News Agency.
Mr Li Peng, China's premier, listed car manufacture as one of the four
pillar industries in his report to the National People's Congress, or
parliament.
