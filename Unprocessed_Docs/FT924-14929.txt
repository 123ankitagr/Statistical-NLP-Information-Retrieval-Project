Sir, Mr Fisher (Letters, October 6) seems to have rosy memories of
travelling on the continent in the 1950s. I am old enough to remember that,
while Germans, French and Italians seemed poor, we British tourists seemed
even poorer. We were free then to spend only (I think) about Pounds 30 a
year abroad, our travel allowance under British exchange controls. I still
have my original passport, recording all money exchanged into foreign
currency and any changed back. Although Pounds 30 was worth a lot more then,
it did not go all that far. Brian Reading,
