US OFFICIALS have assured Mr Don Russell, Australia's ambassador to the US,
that they will act consistently with President Bill Clinton's undertaking to
protect Australia from any negative effects of the Export Enhancement
Programme.
Last week, Australia protested that the US had allocated 100,000 tonnes of
subsidised malting barley to China under the EEP for 1993-94. China, which
was not previously included in EEP barley allocations, represents the most
important malting barley export market for Australian growers.
Mr Tony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, told Mr Russell
that the US recognised that China was a sensitive and major market for
Australian exports of malting barley. However, he also pointed to unfair EC
marketing in China, an Australian Embassy statement issued in Washington
said.
