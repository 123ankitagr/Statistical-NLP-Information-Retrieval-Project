What did tailback Bo Jackson do with the 10 days he had between the end of baseball season and last Saturday, when he reported to the Raiders? 
"I did some hunting," Jackson said. "We went to Georgia and hunted wild boar with a bow and arrow." 
Did Jackson get one? 
"I got one, but I couldn't find it," he said. "He went off with my arrow. And a swamp isn't the place you want to be at 9 at night." 
The Raiders released tight end Rich Bartelewski and linebacker Joe Cormier from the practice squad to make room for defensive end Howie Long and tackle Bruce Wilkerson. CHRIS BAKER
