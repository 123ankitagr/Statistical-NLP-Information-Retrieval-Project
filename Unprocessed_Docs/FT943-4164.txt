Approved Taiwanese investment in China fell sharply during the first eight
months of the year to Dollars 652.1m, down 31 per cent from the same period
in 1993, according to government figures published yesterday. For 1993,
Taiwanese commitments in China totalled Dollars 3.17bn. Taiwan's overseas
investments to August, apart from those in China, climbed 15 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 1.15bn. The government's Investment Commission
attributed the rise to increased funds flowing into the British Virgin
Islands, through which Taiwanese companies may invest in Europe without
paying tax. Such investments jumped 137 per cent to Dollars 821.4m, making
the islands the largest investment destination so far this year. China's
mishandling of a murderous attack on 24 Taiwanese tourists in China's
Zhejiang province in late March dealt a blow to investor confidence. For the
three months before this, approvals had been up 139 per cent on the year.
