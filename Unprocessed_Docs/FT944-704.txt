Christmas television is going to be launched in cyberspace for the first
time on Christmas day with the Queen's broadcast leading the way.
In what is claimed to be the first rudimentary television schedule to be
transmitted on the Internet global computer network, a London consultancy
called Intervid is offering three hours of programmes.
After the midday launch fanfare, the Christmas schedule will get under way
with Xmas With the First Family - breakfast with Mr and Mrs Clinton courtesy
of the White House pages of the Internet World Wide Web.
Then it is Herbie Hancock live from Japan via a feed from NHK, the Japanese
broadcaster. The Queen will be broadcast later - one minute after the real
thing.
Internet users with special software - CU-SeeMe - will be able to see the
schedule with the majority of viewers likely to be in California and Japan.
University College London has helped by making bandwidth available to the
service.
