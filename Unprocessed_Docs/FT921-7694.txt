North and South Korea wound up two days of high-level talks yesterday after
putting two historic peace accords into effect, but failed to resolve a
nuclear dispute, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
The rival Koreas hailed the agreements as an historical step to eventual
unification. But the failure to resolve concerns over North Korean nuclear
weapons development was seen as a serious rift.
North Korean leader Kim Il Sung called for mutual arms reductions and for
withdrawal of all US troops.
