MRS DEBORAH MILLER, a former Royal Air Force servicewoman, has received a
record Pounds 33,000 award from an industrial tribunal as compensation for
being dismissed by the Ministry of Defence when she became pregnant.
The award means the ministry may have to pay up to Pounds 100m in
compensation to 4,500 women who have been dismissed from the services since
1970 as a result of pregnancy.
