AUTOMOBILES Peugeot sold 2.4 per cent fewer new cars in Europe in 1992 as a
disappointing showing in its domestic market overwhelmed a slight rise in
other sales, Reuter reports from Paris.
The French company, the largest of two vehicle-making units within PSA
Peugeot Citroen, said it sold 994,800 cars in 17 European countries in 1992,
down from 1,018,800 in 1991.
