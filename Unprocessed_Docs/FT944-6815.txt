All rather odd. Sir Donald Gosling, founder and major shareholder of
National Car Parks and the venture capitalists who had planned to buy his
company, are off to lunch at the Savoy on Friday to celebrate the collapse
of their Pounds 650m deal.
The occasion is the Saints and Sinners charity lunch. Is this a sly dig at
venture capitalist Prudential Venture Managers following its unwillingness
to put up the last Pounds 50m? Alternatively, maybe it is a belated
recognition by Gosling that NCP's second largest institutional shareholder
is probably worth keeping happy. Interesting to see who picks up the
champagne bill.
