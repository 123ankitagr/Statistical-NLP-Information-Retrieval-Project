Barings, the merchant bank and securities house, has signed the largest
letting in the City of London for three years, taking 235,000 sq ft of
office space at an average rent of Pounds 32.50 per sq ft.
The deal sets a new benchmark for prime City office rents.
Barings has signed a 22-year lease from Scottish Widows, which developed the
site at 60 London Wall, with an 18-month rent-free period but no break
clause, committing Barings to paying the rent until the end of the lease.
It will pay annual rent of Pounds 7.75m, equivalent to Pounds 35 per sq ft
for the best space but less for lower floors.
In a separate transaction, Scottish Widows is taking over the lease on
offices at America Square now occupied by Baring Securities.
Rent due under this lease is Pounds 3m, with a two-year rent free period to
find a tenant.
In spite of the complex nature of the deal, agents said that rents for the
best office space in the City had clearly risen from the Pounds 30 per sq ft
which prevailed earlier in the year.
