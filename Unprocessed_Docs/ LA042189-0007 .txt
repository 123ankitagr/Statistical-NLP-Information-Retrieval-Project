The poor are not the only group with health insurance problems. Those people with pre-existing conditions cannot obtain health insurance today in California. Even if one is in very good health and willing to pay, health insurance is not available. 
The Legislature should require that the health insurance industry accept everyone who applies and is willing to pay. Those with pre-existing conditions could be in an "assigned-risk" category and pay higher premiums.
