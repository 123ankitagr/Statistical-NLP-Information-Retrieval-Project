A federal judge yesterday delayed until January 5 the Iran-Contra trial of
former US defence secretary Caspar Weinberger, who faces five criminal
charges, stemming from the Reagan-era scandal, Reuter reports from
Washington. The trial had been set for November 2, one day before
presidential elections.
