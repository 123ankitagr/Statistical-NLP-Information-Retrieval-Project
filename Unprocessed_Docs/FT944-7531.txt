Vicky Sleddon, 27, who has been managing Kleinwort Benson's new Pounds 500m
European Privatisation Trust, has been poached by Mercury Asset Management
to help manage its Pounds 575m European Privatisation Trust. The two firms
set up their new trusts within a few weeks of each other and to date Mercury
has performed slightly better.
