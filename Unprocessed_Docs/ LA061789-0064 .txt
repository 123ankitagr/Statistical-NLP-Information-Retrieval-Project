U.S. Atty. Robert Bonner, the region's chief federal prosecutor, was sworn in Friday as the district's newest federal judge. 
Bonner, 46, was appointed to the U.S. District Court post by President Bush on May 22, four days after his confirmation by the U.S. Senate. 
In a courtroom packed with his colleagues, friends and family members, Bonner took his oath for the lifetime post from U.S. District Judge Albert L. Stephens. 
Gary A. Feess, chief assistant U.S. attorney, was named to take over for Bonner on an interim basis and oversee the 141-lawyer office until a replacement is nominated by Bush and confirmed by the U.S. Senate. 
Bonner replaces U.S. District Judge Pamela Rymer, who was confirmed for a seat on the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.
