What hope is there for London City Airport? To make sure that it's getting
information about the airport and its destinations to the right people it is
engaging in what it calls some 'simple lifestyle research'. Regular
travellers are being asked which magazines they usually read. Males are
requested to tick the following boxes, Economist, Investors Chronicle,
Director and GQ. Females are limited to Executive PA, Office Secretary,
Marie-Claire and Cosmopolitan . . .
