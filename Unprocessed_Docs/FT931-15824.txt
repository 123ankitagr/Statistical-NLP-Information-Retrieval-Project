MS LIZ FORGAN, director of programmes at Channel 4, will be named today as
managing director of BBC Radio in succession to Mr David Hatch.
Ms Forgan, 48, has worked on national newspapers, but has no experience in
radio. It had been assumed that Ms Forgan, who has a reputation as an
independent-minded defender of broadcasting freedom, would become managing
director of BBC Television in succession to Mr Will Wyatt.
Mr Bob Phillis, chief executive of Independent Television News, will be
confirmed today as the new deputy director-general of the BBC.
Mr Phillis, a former managing director of Central Independent Television and
former group managing director of Carlton Communications, is the most
important of the new BBC appointments to be announced by Mr John Birt, who
took over as director-general on January 4.
The new deputy director-general, who is 47, will have the title of managing
director of resources.
He will have control over the entire operational and financial structure of
the BBC and will be responsible for overseeing, at least for some time, the
corporation's international activities, including BBC World Service and
World Service Television.
The managerial changes do not imply a big structural re-organisation at the
BBC, at least not immediately. Mr Phillis, who introduced tighter financial
controls at ITN, will have the task of improving financial disciplines at
the much larger BBC.
