Video games carry only a small chance of triggering epileptic fits, a study
ordered by the Department of Trade and Industry's Consumer Safety Unit said
yesterday.
People who suffer a first fit while playing games usually have an
unrecognised sensitivity to flashing light, said the report. Watching games
would 'very rarely' spark an epileptic seizure in people without a history
of the condition.
