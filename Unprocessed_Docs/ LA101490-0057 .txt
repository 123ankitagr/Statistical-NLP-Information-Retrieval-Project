Wish You Were Here (CBS Friday at 9 p.m.) introduces us to teen-age actress Emily Lloyd, whose performance as a cheeky 15-year-old in a staid English town is one of those extraordinary fusions of actress and role that defy you to pry them apart. 
The Saturday night lineup of oldies but goodies should tempt anyone to stay home: King's Row (KTLA at 8 p.m.) -- the former president's best; Hud (KCOP at 8 p.m.), Laura (KCET at 9 p.m.) and, best of all, Detour (KCETat 10:30 p.m.), Edgar Ulmer's fast and furious film noir classic.
