Sir, Joe Rogaly's suggestion that we should be thinking of raising rather
than lowering the pension age ('Age of the old buffer', April 20) has an
attractive logic given the recent Carnegie inquiry projections of 31 per
cent of the UK population in the age group 50-74 by 2021, compared with 24
per cent now. But what are we going to do to enable older people to work
more years if they wish to? (Mr Rogaly quotes statistics which show a
declining percentage of men aged over 55 as being 'economically active'.)
One way would be for the EC to follow the US and bar age discrimination in
employment. I regret that it is unlikely to do so, however, since the
Commission, the Council of Ministers and the European parliament all
practice age discrimination in recruitment with the full approbation of EC
staff unions]
