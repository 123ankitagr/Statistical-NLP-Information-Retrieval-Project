First City-Santee Town Center, a joint venture, has purchased 22.5 acres at the corner of Mission Gorge and Town Center Drive in Santee from The Hahn Co. 
The developers, First City-California II and Santee Town Center Associates, a limited partnership with La Jolla Pacific Development Group, are planning to build a $23-million, 235,000-square-foot shopping center on the site. 
Construction of Santee Town Center, which will emulate the old- fashioned town squares of the 1800's settlements, will begin in May with an estimated project completion in early 1990.
