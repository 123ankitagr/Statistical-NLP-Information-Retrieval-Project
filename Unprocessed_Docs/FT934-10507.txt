The US and South Korea yesterday postponed a decision on whether to hold the
joint Team Spirit military exercise next year in an attempt to persuade
North Korea to resume international nuclear inspections, John Burton reports
from Seoul.
Pyongyang had demanded the suspension of Team Spirit as a condition for
permitting renewed nuclear inspections by the International Atomic Energy
Agency (IAEA).
Mr Les Aspin, the US defence secretary, indicated after a meeting in Seoul
with South Korean officials that Team Spirit would be suspended if North
Korea allows IAEA inspectors access to its nuclear facilities and holds
substantive talks with South Korea on the nuclear issue.
'Our patience is not unlimited,' said Mr Aspin, but he added that 'we are
not prepared to set deadlines at this particular juncture' for a North
Korean response.
