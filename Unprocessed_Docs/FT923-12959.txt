JUPITER Tyndall Merlin, the fund management group, yesterday announced it
was in discussions with an investment trust over the possibility of an offer
being made for Pacific Horizon Investment Trust.
The announcement provoked another round of controversy in the long-running
attempt to restructure the trust.
Last month, Jupiter Tyndall blocked a bid by Martin Currie Pacific Trust for
Pacific Horizon, whose funds it manages. The directors of Pacific Horizon
had unanimously recommended the Martin Currie bid.
Jupiter Tyndall has also announced plans to restructure Pacific Horizon.
Yesterday it said its discussions with the investment trust involved 'an
offer being made for the whole of the share capital and outstanding warrants
in Pacific Horizon on terms which would be significantly better than those
which were available under the offer from Martin Currie Pacific.'
The announcement provoked an angry response from the board of Pacific
Horizon, which said it was extremely concerned that, 'a proposal of this
kind should be notified to it by way of public announcement and that the
Jupiter Group did not notify the board of its discussions in advance'.
It said it was not aware of the proposals' terms or of the identity of the
offerer.
The directors also invited the offerer to come forward and make itself known
to them.
Jupiter Tyndall is requisitioning an extraordinary meeting of Pacific
Horizon to appoint new directors and consider restructuring proposals.
Pacific Horizon directors said they had written to Jupiter Tyndall
requesting it to withdraw its requisition until it was clear whether an
offer had been made.
They said that it would be a 'flagrant waste of Pacific Horizon's funds' to
convene and hold a meeting while the possibility of a new offer existed.
