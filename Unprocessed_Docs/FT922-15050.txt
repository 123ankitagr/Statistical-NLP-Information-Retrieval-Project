Sir, Vanessa Houlder refers to new towns showing their age (The Property
Market, March 27). I would like to point out that the infrastructure of a
town is as important as the design of the buildings, if not more so.
The first new towns were chosen in strategic locations with excellent road
and rail communications and good access to London. They were well planned
with good road systems, ample car parking, shopping and leisure facilities
in the right position within the town together with quality modern housing.
Stevenage, for example, continues to attract investment from major
multinational companies. Over the past three years more than Pounds 1bn has
been invested in the town by such companies as Glaxo, Provident Mutual,
Confederation Life and British Aerospace. Is it a coincidence that Stevenage
has only one set of traffic lights?
