The founder of Mexico's largest brokerage has declared his innocence on charges of illegal trading and criminal fraud following his arraignment at a Mexico City prison. "I hope there will be justice. I'm innocent. I believe in the Mexican laws," said Eduardo Legoretta, chairman and a founder of Operadora de Bolsa, said after being arraigned at the city's Eastern Penitentiary. Legoretta and three other top brokerage officials were arrested Monday and later charged with illegal trading related to the October, 1987, Mexican stock market crash.
