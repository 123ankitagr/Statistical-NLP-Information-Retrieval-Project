Three Orange County ad agencies were among those carting off honors in the recent 43rd annual competition sponsored by Los Angeles Advertising Women. 
Among the local entrants, Roberts/Mealer, Emerson Marketing/Communications received the most awards. Staffers at the Costa Mesa agency won three Lulu statuettes -- the organization's most coveted award -- and an award for excellence for their direct marketing and sales promotion brochures. 
Those at Roberts/Mealer who won were Lynda Lawrence, Bruce Mayo, Pat Holohan, Chuck Roberts, Jill Stone and Rob Wagner. 
Another Lulu in the "It's a Rough Business" category went to Anne K. Morris of Morris Advertising & Design in Costa Mesa -- for a print ad that never went public. 
Morris won a Lulu for two ads in a three-part ad campaign designed for a new housing development. The ads became eligible for the award when the development sold out after only the first ad was used. 
An excellence award for logo/trademark design went to Andrew Skiver and Stu Vandermuelen of Newport Beach's InterCommunications Inc. 
In all, 15 Orange County agencies entered the competition. The awards recognize excellence by individuals in advertising and public relations.
