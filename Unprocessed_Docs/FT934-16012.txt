Terrified of spiders, water or work? Fear no more, help is at hand via the
DTI whose enterprising officials have handed out Pounds 45,000 towards a
guide on how to overcome just such phobias.
According to Stuart Toole, managing director of software house CASW, which
is crafting a computer program to help sufferers combat their fears, phobias
constitute one important reason behind rising absenteeism from work.
Sadly the DTI declined to explain how this initiative would help those
afflicted with that common phobia - of computers.
