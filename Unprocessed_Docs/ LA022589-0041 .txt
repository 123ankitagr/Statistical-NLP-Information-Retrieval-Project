If Michael Jackson is truly disenchanted because "Bad" did not outsell "Thriller," he should look at his unrealistic expectations rather than at Frank Dileo ("Pop Star Jackson Fires His Manager," by Patrick Goldstein, Feb. 15). 
He might also look at quality. Although "Bad" is a solid album, one of the best of the last few years, it certainly is no "Thriller." One listen to "Billie Jean" or "Beat It" should remind him of that. 
If Jackson were to talk with Prince, Fleetwood Mac, or Peter Frampton, he would be overjoyed with "Bad's" sales and ability to stand on its own. After all it could have gone the way of the follow-ups to their mega-selling albums. Does anybody remember "I'm in You?"
