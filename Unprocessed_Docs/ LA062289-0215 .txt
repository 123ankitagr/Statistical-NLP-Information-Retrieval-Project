House Democrats today elected Rep. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento), a member of the Ethics Committee, to a post in their leadership. 
Fazio was elected vice chairman of the House Democratic Caucus on the second ballot of a four-way race. 
Fazio, 46, bested his nearest rival, Rep. Martin Frost (D-Tex.), by a 2-1 margin in the race to fill the last vacancy remaining from the party shake-up triggered by the resignation of House Speaker Jim Wright. Reps. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) and Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) finished far back.
