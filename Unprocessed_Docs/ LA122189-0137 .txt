A Louisiana processor is voluntarily recalling about 1,000 pounds of a frozen pork and rice product because it might be contaminated with a food-poisoning organism, Listeria monocytogenes, the Agriculture Department reported Wednesday. 
Bodin Foods Inc. of New Iberia, La., sells the product through small distributors in Arizona, California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas. 
It is sold frozen in vacuum-sealed plastic packages with the name "Boo Dan (Boudin Link) Traditional Cajun Pudding" on the label and "Est. 8214" printed inside the USDA inspection seal. Each 10-ounce package sold in groceries contains two links and is shipped 12 to a carton. 
Listeriosis was described as "a rare but potentially serious" disease. Most vulnerable are those with weakened immune systems, including infants, the elderly and the chronically ill. 
Symptoms include the sudden onset of flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, headache, respiratory distress, backache, loss of appetite and sometimes abdominal pain and diarrhea.
