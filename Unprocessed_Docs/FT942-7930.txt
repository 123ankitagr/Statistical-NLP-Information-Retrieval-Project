Investors are likely to return from today's public holiday to be confronted
with the figures for German M3 money supply growth in April. Due early this
week, the data could unsettle the market.
Expectations had been that the annualised, seasonally adjusted rate of
growth would sink to 13 per cent in April after 15.4 per cent in the
previous month.
But an article in last Friday's Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper suggested
that the figure may prove to be above the March outcome.
If this proves to be the case, the Bundesbank's chances of hitting its 4 to
6 per cent target for monetary growth for the year as a whole will recede
still further. And the Bundesbank's new policy - introduced this month with
the half percentage point cut in the discount and Lombard rates - of using
interest rate cuts to reduce M3 growth will look more of a gamble than ever,
although of course these cuts were too late to influence the April data.
If the M3 data dampens investors' enthusiasm for bunds, this may be revived
by a good inflation figure for May.
Due to be announced at the end of the week, the figure could be down to an
annual rate of below 3 per cent at last. Coupled with a strong D-Mark, this
could revive hopes of further rate cuts.
