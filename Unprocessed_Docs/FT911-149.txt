TEA Demand was fair but selective, reports the Tea Brokers' Association.
Bright liquoring teas and many of the better mediums were 3-5p easier.
Central Africans met good competition at firm to dearer rates. Plain
descriptions were generally neglected and 1-3p lower where sold. Ceylons
were well supported with brighter teas dearer and the balance tending
easier. Offshore teas sold readily but prices for the brightest kinds were
lower. Quotations: quality 210p (240p) medium 110p (114p), low medium 72p
(74p).
