EGYPT'S parliament has approved the establishment of an export credit
organisation with capital of EPounds 100m (Pounds 17m) to help promote
exports.
Dr Hazem Beblawi, chairman of the Export Development Bank of Egypt who will
also head the new Export Credit Guarantee Company of Egypt (EGCE), said
credit support would put Egyptian exporters on the 'same footing' as their
competitors. EGCE is expected to begin operations before the end of this
year, and its establishment coincides with heightened efforts by Egypt to
improve its trading performance. The World Bank, which helped fund studies
into requirements for a credit agency, has been pressing Egypt to expand
non-traditional exports.
