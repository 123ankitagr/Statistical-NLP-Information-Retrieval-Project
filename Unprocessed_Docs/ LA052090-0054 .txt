Regarding Howard Rosenberg's May 13 article about Kirstie Wilde, the former Los Angeles news anchor: I am curious as to why Wilde underscored the crazed heinousness of John Gacy's crimes by noting he was not just a garden-variety mass murderer but a "homosexual mass murderer!!" So, mass murder committed by heterosexual persons is more indicative of a healthy personality?
