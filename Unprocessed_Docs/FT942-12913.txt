Citizen, the Japanese watch and information equipment maker, has agreed to
manufacture mobile computers for Digital Equipment, the US computer maker.
Citizen said the deal covered notebook and sub-notebook computers but not
personal digital assistants. The products manufactured by Citizen would be
marketed and sold exclusively by Digital and its authorised channels, the
companies said.
The Japanese company will bring to the partnership its expertise in
miniaturisation and component technologies. Its tie-up with Digital would
provide it with opportunities to market the computer peripherals that
Citizen manufactures, the company said.
