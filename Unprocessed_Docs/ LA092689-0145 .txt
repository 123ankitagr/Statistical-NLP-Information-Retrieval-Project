Forty-eight hours of tapes secretly recorded by former President Richard M. Nixon will be released in April unless Nixon or others involved in the recordings object, National Archives officials said today. 
The new tapes are among more than 4,000 hours of recordings made on a secret White House monitoring system between 1971 and 1973, at a time when abuses of power were being committed that led to Nixon's political downfall and the jailing of many of his aides. 
Nixon resigned the presidency in August, 1974, under threat of impeachment in the Watergate scandal.
