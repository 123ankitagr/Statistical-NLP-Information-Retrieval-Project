Chuck Faucette, who played nine games at inside linebacker for the Chargers in the 1987 and '88 seasons, has been named football coach of Crawford High, replacing Dan Armstrong, who accepted a position at Colton High in San Bernardino County. 
Faucette, 26, played one game for the Chargers during the 1987 strike before being sidelined with a knee injury. After eight starts in 1988, his season was ended by a neck injury. He was released before training camp last season after failing the team physical. 
Roger Engle, Crawford's athletic director, said Faucette was selected from six candidates.
