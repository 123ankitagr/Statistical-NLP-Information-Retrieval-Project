Sir, We write to complain about the highly offensive tone of your piece in
Observer: 'Difficulties with a girl' (May 18). The piece is a reference to a
planned meeting between President Clinton and the leader of the Labour
party.
The diarist writes on the assumption that 'the girl' that is the subject of
his piece, the Rt Hon Mrs Margaret Beckett MP, 'will not get the job' of
Labour leader. On what is this assessment based? As we understand the
constitutional position, Mrs Beckett is already in post as leader of the
Labour party. Nominations and the election for the post of a new leader have
not yet been opened.
Mrs Beckett has announced that as our leader she will fight for victory in
the European election campaign before declaring her position. We have every
confidence that she will lead us to victory, and that, should she choose to
stand in the forthcoming election, she will make a formidable contender for
the post.
The person who wrote your piece displays a misogyny common in Fleet Street
and the corridors of Westminster. We regret this, as we look to the FT for
adult comment and analysis on political affairs.
