In response to "Leningrad Welcomes L.A. as Sister City and Mentor," (Metro, Oct. 25): 
You gotta be kidding! Send our city workers to Leningrad? Mayor Tom Bradley sure got carried away this time. 
When all we hear is needing more funds for the homeless, overtime for the police, cutting jobs due to budget, we sure don't need to extend our charity overseas. The Soviet government is responsible for the condition of its streets and city government, not us. 
City Council, beware. If this is what comes from the mayor's and council's excursions, we don't need any more.
