the convention on biological diversity agreed at the recent earth summit in rio de janeiro could have the unintended effect of impeding the breeding of new plant species plant geneticists fear the problem arises from uncertainty over the convention's implications for the legal ownership of plant resources held at 17 major international agricultural research centres maintaining biodiversity that is a wide range and assortment of plants helps to provide protection against pests and diseases and is vital for the breeding of improved crop varieties it is considered essential for food supplies in both northern and southern hemispheres in rio more than 150 countries signed the convention the stated objectives of which are the conservation of biological diversity the sustainable use of its components and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising out of the utilisation of genetic resources it will come into force once it has been ratified by 30 countries probably by early next year the research centres which make up the consultative group on international agricultural research network store about 600,000 plant samples in their geno-plasmic' banks these amount to some 35 per cent of the world's genetic plant material including major collections of crops such as rice wheat maize and other important cereals most of the centres are located in developing countries as the north is poor in genetic materials one of the centres the international rice research institute in the philippines for example has about 85,000 cultivated and wild rices in store many of the wild varieties have been collected from fields forests riverbanks and remote areas according to the un food and agriculture organisation since the beginning of the century about three-quarters of the world's genetic plant material has been lost and some 50,000 more species disappear every year reducing the pool of material that is available for breeding new varieties over-harvesting pollution and the disappearance of tropical forest cover are largely responsible for this loss the current decline in biodiversity is largely the result of human activity and represents a serious threat says the agenda 21 plan of action agreed at the rio summit the biodiversity convention is designed to halt this loss of plant life and will also mean that a country from which a plant originates can claim rent if it is used in the development of a commercial crop variety for some countries this could mean sizeable increases in foreign earnings it is this question of property rights for the countries of origin that could impede distribution of plant material from the 17 research centres a year to crop-breeding programmes throughout the world at present they send out about 100,000 samples a year one interpretation of the convention is that a research centre would have to get permission from the countries of origin before it distributes materials says mr geoffrey hawtin director of one of the centres the rome-based international board for plants genetic resources some crop varieties he points out may have 20 different parents meaning that plants from 20 countries have been used in their development the status of this material is unclear believes mr hawtin depending on how the convention is interpreted they are either covered by or excluded from its provisions if crop samples in the cgir network are covered then centres would need the expressed permission of the countries of origin of all their materials before they would be able to distribute them he says such a bureaucratic nightmare could seriously slow down the distribution of crop samples it could hinder the development of new varieties and have repercussions for food supplies says mr hawtin but it is clearly the convention's intention to facilitate the movement of materials rather than impede them he believes that it is necessary for the countries that sign the convention expected to be all except the us to clear up the confusion at an early stage and agree on a protocol or similar legal mechanism to guarantee the free exchange of genetic material mr hawtin expects the overall effect of the convention to be positive it calls for more attention to be paid to genetic diversity for more scientific research to underpin the efforts and will help raise consciousness of the issues the convention requires countries to establish a system of protected areas where special measures need to be taken to conserve biological diversity it stresses the importance of management of resources and the rehabilitation of degraded areas it also states that industrial countries will provide new and additional financial resources for the preservation of genetic materials funds for this are at present insufficient believes mr hawtin and efforts are being made to obtain dollars 300 m a year for maintaining biodiversity about three times more than the present level of funding however if the confusion over the status of genetic material is not cleared up before the biodiversity convention takes effect the world-wide distribution of crop samples from the cgiar centres could slow down dramatically causing serious delays in the development of new varieties
