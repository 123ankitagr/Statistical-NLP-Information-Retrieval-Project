i always thought hollywood would provide me with a living what i hadn't expected was that it would also provide me with a subject i'm trying to write about the daily life of hollywood in a way that's more realistic than not most fiction about the movies falls into two categories angry screeds about the unfairness of the business written mostly by disaffected screenwriters or supercharged fantasies that try to be about glamour mostly who wears what and who sleeps with whom my intention is to reflect what actually goes on and that certainly includes anger and glamour but i hope what i write reveals something of the way the business and the people in it really operate
