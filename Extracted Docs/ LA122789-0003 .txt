That 's Italian : A low-budget TV show where men and women throw off their clothes to win prizes is gaining popularity in Italy , despite condemnation by critics , and might be coming to America . On the `` Hit It Big '' ( Colpo Grosso ) game show , contestants strip down to their underwear , accumulating points as they peel off layers of clothing to the rhythm of pop music . When the show first aired three years ago , it was criticized by the Roman Catholic Church , the press and politicians . But producer Umberto Smaila has sold the show in Germany and says he is negotiating with American cable television . `` Italians have shown they 're very mature . Beyond seeing it as just about naked breasts and bottoms , they 've understood it 's just fun , like the Paris Lido , '' Smaila said . Claudia Puig
