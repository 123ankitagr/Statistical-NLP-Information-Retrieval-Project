it is always an accolade for a family of plants to have a book devoted entirely to it this has just happened with hemerocallis day lilies the simple title of walter erhardts new book published by batsford pounds 1799 such specialist books can prosper only when there is a considerable body of interest in the plants and although the sale of day lilies in britain must still be minute compared with the us many people do grow them with the introduction of new colours and better performance that number is likely to increase for day lilies are easy to manage the main thing holding back expansion in the uk is the reluctance of the big commercial producers of hardy herbaceous perennials to grow more than a few mostly old varieties for almost anything new you must search among the small specialist nurseries of which there are a dozen or so for day lilies the existence of the plant finder has made this task much easier there are also three national collections of hemerocallis which are spaced out nicely one is in the southwest at antony house tor point cornwall a national trust property two others are in public parks one at east court house ewell surrey and the other under the control of leeds city councils department of leisure services 19 wellington street leeds west yorkshire perhaps most useful of all is the excellent permanent trial of day lilies in the royal horticultural societys garden at wisley surrey where awards are given for garden excellence and the naming is very good it is no surprise to learn that day lilies have been grown for centuries in chinese gardens for they originate in asia and chinese gardeners always have been quick to pick up good plants but day lilies have been grown in the uk since the 16th century so britons have had time to get used to them the trouble is that the wild species are not themselves particularly exciting it is the increasingly complex hybrids made from them largely in america that are most attractive there is now a bewildering array of varieties which must be whittled down to manageable proportions by trials such as those at wisley and by individual growers it is easy to get the wrong ideas about day lilies for example that their flowers last for only a single day which is what the popular name implies erhardt distinguishes three distinct types of flowering which he calls day blooming night blooming and extended blooming clearly the night flowering kinds are not wanted for gardens although they might have some use in breeding programmes if they have some desirable quality most of the species and also the older garden varieties are day blooming somewhat chillingly erhardt says that as a rule the flowers of these last long enough to allow you to form an opinion about their worth even if you are out at work during the day however since many of these species are not really plants for evening gardeners the extended flowering types are being sought with increasing eagerness with these erhardt says the flowers may last from one morning until the next or from one evening to the next which might not be quite so attractive best of all and quite possible to obtain are varieties that open in the morning and persist until the evening of the second day i can imagine a time when all day lilies that are expected to win awards will have to measure up to this category garden varieties of day lilies now vary enormously in size and shape of flower height and habit of growth and colour in this last respect it is astonishing what has been coaxed out of a family which in the wild produces only yellow and tawny orange glowers now we take for granted true reds and crimsons many lovely shades of pink apricot peach and orange yellows of all kinds and even nearwhites although as yet these are not very satisfactory there are many varieties with two or more colours marked and patterned in various ways there are even purple varieties which some gardeners find very exciting but seem to me to be rather dull one valuable quality of day lilies is their ability to drop faded flowers so that the plants look smart without the need for daily deadheading unlike true lilies day lilies do not make any bulbs and so are planted like any other hardy herbaceous perennials in spring or autumn if moved from the open ground or at any time if in containers they are not fussy about soil and do not object to lime
