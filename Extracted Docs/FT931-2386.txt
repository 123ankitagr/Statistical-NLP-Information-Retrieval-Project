JUSTICE Byron White yesterday announced his retirement from the Supreme Court , thus handing President Bill Clinton a first and early opportunity to begin reshaping the highest court . Justice White , who is 75 , said that after 31 years 'someone else should be permitted to have a like experience . ' Appointed by President Kennedy in 1962 , he is the only nominee of a Democratic president now sitting on the court . Not since 1967 , when President Johnson elevated the late Justice Thurgood Marshall , has a vacancy occurred during a Democrat presidency . At least one other member of the court , Justice Harry Blackmun , has recently spoken openly about retiring . Though appointed by President Nixon , he has emerged as one of the most liberal members , whereas Justice White has become more conservative . Two names most frequently mentioned as likely Clinton nominations are governor Mario Cuomo of New York and Mrs Marian Wright Edelman , guiding light behind the Children 's Defence Fund and a close friend of the president and his wife .
