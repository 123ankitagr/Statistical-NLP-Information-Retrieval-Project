do you believe that the more you diet the harder it is to lose weight because your body adapts and turns down your rate of burning calories your metabolism this belief is extremely popular but wrong according to new us department of agriculture research by dr william rumpler who used a specially built roomsize livein calorimeter to assess calories burned researchers measured calories burned during 24hour periods before and after 28 men went on a caloriereduced diet considering lower caloric intake the men did not burn fewer calories than they did prior to the diet their metabolism rate did not decrease says dr paul moe head of the usda lab this is good news for dieters because they can now be confident that if they stay on a reducedcalorie diet they will lose weight insists moe he says a main reason dieters have so much trouble continuing to lose weight is because they dont take in fewer calories for their reduced body size if you were once 130 pounds and you get down to 110 he explains you must eat like a person who weighs 110 not someone who still weighs 130 if you fear developing pancreatic cancer eat more beans lentils peas legumes and dried fruits ditto for prostate cancer to ward off colon cancer eat more betacarotene foods such as carrots spinach and other green leafy vegetables and cut back on meat to inhibit lung and stomach cancer eat more fruit those are the implications from the latest findings of a longterm study of 34000 seventh day adventists those eating the most of such foods were least likely to develop such cancers what about heart disease surprisingly after accounting for such factors as smoking obesity and high blood pressure one food stood out as protective against heart attacks nuts says dr gary fraser director of the study and a professor at loma linda university school of medicine people who ate nuts four times a week had about half the chances of a fatal or nonfatal heart attack as those who ate nuts less than once a week what kind of nuts thats what fraser wants to know too hes planning tests to feed men various nuts and then check their blood pressure blood fats and bloodclotting factors is fiber the reason highfiber foods seem to discourage various diseases including cancer heart disease and diabetes maybe not or maybe fiber is only part of the reason thats what dr lilian thompson university of toronto among others is discovering in trying to sort out what makes highfiber high complex carbohydrate foods healthful she found that a compound previously thought harmful may in fact be beneficial its phytate also called phytic acid it is highly concentrated in highfiber foods notably dried beans and lentils such legumes are wellestablished reducers of blood cholesterol and blood sugar but when thompson removed phytate from navy bean flour it no longer stopped sharp surges of blood sugar in human volunteers only beans with phytate did that regardless of their fiber content that makes thompson speculate that socalled antinutrients like phytate are mostly responsible for the benefits of highfiber foods phytates may also be one reason legumelovers have less cancer of certain types university of maryland researchers found that cancerexposed rats given phytate in their drinking water had 35 fewer cancers than rats not given phytate
