After years of debate , official China has bowed to one more once-taboo capitalist practice -- tipping . A fast-food restaurant run by American and Chinese managers in reformist city Tianjin has gotten the go-ahead to test out tipping . The official Beijing Review magazine said Saturday that servers who once recoiled in shock at being given a tip now take the money `` as a matter of course . '' There are indications , the magazine said , of a more flexible official policy . But as foreigners in China have learned , taxi-drivers and other tourism workers made their policy decision a long time ago .
