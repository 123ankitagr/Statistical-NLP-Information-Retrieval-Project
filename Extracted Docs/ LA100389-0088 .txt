Davey Johnson says he is convinced he is out as manager of the New York Mets , according to a published report . `` They 're not bringing me back , '' Johnson is quoted as saying in Tuesday 's editions of the New York Times . `` They have n't told me that , but they should have . They 're probably waiting so they can confirm my replacement . And there is somebody available in the organization : Bud Harrelson , who 's popular in New York . '' The newspaper said Joe McIlvaine , the Mets ' vice president for baseball operations , denied that a decision had been made and that one is not expected to be reached until the end of the week or later .
