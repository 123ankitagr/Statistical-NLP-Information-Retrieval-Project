with one member absent tuesday night the compton city council decided to put off a decision on whether to raise residential trash collection rates mayor walker r tucker has been ill and unable to attend council meetings this month the citys trash hauler murcole inc is seeking a rate increase of 1716 that would push the current monthly rate from $ 1132 per residence to $ 1326 the city staff told the council in a memo that the request is excessive because the consumer price index has risen only 49 and dumping fees at landfills have not gone up enough to justify such a high rate hike the city staff is recommending that the rate be raised to $ 1194 which would be a 55 increase the council is scheduled to take up the issue again at its meeting next tuesday
