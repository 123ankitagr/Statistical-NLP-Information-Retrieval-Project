A Torrance foundry , which closed temporarily last week because of excessive emissions of airborne lead , has reopened after a judge 's decision to relax an earlier court restriction on its release of pollutants . The Martin Brass Foundry , at 2341 Jefferson St. , started up Tuesday after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge John Zebrowski ordered it to keep its lead emissions below 3 micrograms per liter of air . The federal standard for lead particles in ambient air is 1.5 micrograms per liter . But foundry attorney Charles Ivie successfully argued in a court hearing Tuesday that the threshold is meant to gauge airborne lead levels in large geographical areas , not at individual plants . On Aug. 16 , Zebrowski ordered Martin Brass to keep its lead emissions within the 1.5-microgram range , after the South Coast Air Quality Management District detected airborne lead concentrations near the plant of up to 20 times the federal standard . The foundry has shut down twice in the last month to repair the vacuum system it uses to control lead dust . The most recent AQMD samples , taken Aug. 21 , showed that the plant was emitting airborne lead in concentrations of 3 micrograms per liter , officials with the air quality agency say .
