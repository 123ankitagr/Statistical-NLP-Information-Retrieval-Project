i have been reading one of those gloomy essays on the corrosive effects of television in the winter issue of the journal daedalus professor john condry of cornell university argues that dross on the box is stunting the development of american children television he claims is contributing to increased youth violence including rising rates of suicide to physical and mental disorders and to a secular decline in educational performance children once learned about society and their place in it from school and by directly observing adults in their local communities today says mr condry television is swamping these influences on average american children spend an incredible 40 hours a week watching the box or playing video games more than a third of their total waking hours school including time spent travelling and doing homework absorbs another 40 hours all other interactions with family and peers which are potentially far more productive than tv have to be crammed into just 32 waking hours a fraction of the time enjoyed by past generations as well as robbing children of precious time tv distorts their sense of reality because it is designed primarily to sell things it has to put a premium on gaining and keeping peoples attention the easiest way to do this is by projecting violence according to mr condry the average hour of childrens programming contains 25 acts of violence far more than adult tv television distorts in other more insidious ways it depicts wealth as the key to happiness but rarely shows people working hard because this would be dull viewing tv thus leads children to seek quick fixes to want things but not to see they must work for them it also presents a dangerously simplistic moral code typically dividing the world into heroes who can do no wrong and villains who can do no right mr condrys indictment has to be taken seriously if children spend more than a third of their waking hours watching tv their characters must be moulded by it yet his criticisms do not apply to all commercially successful programming the producers of the popular series star trek to take one example appear quite responsible back in the late 1960s the starship enterprise was run almost exclusively by white males there was a token black female communications officer and an asian helmsman and toured the universe seemingly looking for trouble in nearly every episode captain james kirk proved his manhood by fighting with some unpleasant alien species surrogates for the evil soviet empire and falling in love with a beautiful blonde guest star star trek the next generation the 1980s relaunch of the series shows distinct signs of progress the cerebral captain jeanluc picard has superseded toughguy kirk a blind black has a responsible post on the bridge women play a more active role and are no longer treated as mere sex objects the ships doctor and security officer for example are both female as in the first series the enterprise is subject to the prime directive essentially a code of noninterference this year a third series star trek deep space nine has hit the nations screens perhaps reflecting the more reactive stance of us foreign policy in the 1990s it is set on a stationary space station rather than a roving starship waiting rather than looking for trouble is the station commander ben sisko impressively played by mr avery brooks a black single parent his deputy is a feisty female the station is packed with aliens of all shapes and sizes many of whom dislike and misunderstand each other a metaphor for the friction endemic to americas multiracial society pushing back social frontiers one leading character the demure lieutenant jadzia dax is a fusion of two lifeforms she has the body of a 28yearold woman but the memories and partly mind of a combative old man and former mentor to commander sisko this could provide scope for a sensitive exploration of gender and sexual identity deep space nine is not exactly great art as in previous incarnations of star trek each episode includes plenty of sanitised violence but by reserving the best roles for minorities and women and by spending as much time on social problems as on warfare it at least sends some useful signals to children commander sisko could become quite an important role model for young black boys but even though some commercial tv may do more good than harm mr condry is right to argue that the us has paid far too little attention to the social impact of this greedy institution it seems pointless endlessly to debate ways of improving school education when so few restraints are placed on childrens tv curriculum ways could surely be found to reduce the number of childhood hours lost to the box to increase the proportion of educational programmes and to limit the portrayal of violence one act of violence every two minutes seems excessive even for the us after all few parents would thinkingly consign their offspring for 40 hours a week to an institution as emptyheaded and violent as commercial television thief of time unfaithful servant television and the american child daedalus winter 1993
