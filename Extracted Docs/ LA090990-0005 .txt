with its peeling wallpaper yellowed curtains smoke-stained fireplaces and maze of upstairs bedrooms bearing the strewn-about belongings of a half-dozen student tenants the hawkins house fits its motto a dream in the making while others may see just a worn 99-year-old house the altadena town hall board of directors sees a future it looks pretty awful but i think we can do a lot with it said board president geri gauthier as she stood inside the hawkins house last week and enthusiastically pointed at empty rooms as she talked visions formed of offices a community theater meeting rooms heritage and historical museums and a chamber of commerce headquarters office for the last two months gauthier and her 15-member board have promoted that vision raising 100,000 toward relocating and converting the victorian home into a town hall the fund raising has been done mainly on a one-on-one basis gauthier said because the unincorporated community of 42,000 lacks an official focal point or town center this is what the town hall will do unify the community gauthier said but the group faces an oct 31 deadline by which they must raise an additional 200,000 and move the house the developer nottingham ltd of west covina which donated the 6,000 square-foot structure to the altadena community needs to give away the house by that date in order to take advantage of tax breaks said jonathan webb a nottingham official nottingham plans to build seven condominiums and a commercial building on the 1.47 acre lot now occupied by the house construction on the condominiums is expected to begin this winter webb said the developer has pledged 20,000 toward the fund-raising effort but 100,000 that was expected from developers cantwell anderson builders of the unrelated la vina housing project has been in limbo ever since la vina opponents succeeded in stopping that project by filing a lawsuit we were almost there on our original fund-raising plan but because of the litigation we don't know what will happen said patricia bunin town hall board member with the 100,000 raised so far the town hall group has enough money to pay for moving the house and placing it on blocks at the new site a mile away on el molino avenue between the county sheriff and fire stations there under a low-cost lease from the county it will be refurbished by volunteer efforts gauthier said but the town hall group wants to ensure that the house is functional after the move the 200,000 would be used for a foundation at the new site needed to convert the house's basement into a 250-person capacity ground-floor theater and change the house from two stories to three architect george fulks said the new foundation would also take care of much of the earthquake safety work needed on the structure he said in addition the money would fund electric and water connections the town hall group hopes to raise the money by the deadline by finding founders willing to donate 1,000 each and by holding a public event to gather smaller donations we're optimistic bunin said for fotos
