Two brothers accused of killing two men and wounding a third in a Glendale tavern last November have been ordered to stand trial on murder and conspiracy charges . After four days of testimony by a dozen witnesses , including a victim of the Nov. 24 incident , Glendale Municipal Judge Charles Horan ruled Monday there was sufficient evidence to bring Rodolfo Marquez , 21 , and Manuel Marquez , 25 , to trial . The two brothers from Atwater are each charged with two counts of murder , one count of attempted murder and one count of conspiracy to attempt murder for a shooting at the Rustic Inn on San Fernando Road . If convicted , they could be sentenced to death or life in prison without parole , said Deputy Dist . Atty . Patty Shrader . The death penalty may be invoked for a murder conviction if more than one person is killed . A third man , Constancio Villagrana , 25 , of Bell , faces one count of conspiracy to commit murder . He could be sentenced to 25 years to life in prison if convicted , Shrader said . The three will be arraigned Feb. 6 in Pasadena Superior Court . Prosecutors said they believe the men left the tavern after being in a fistfight , then returned about 30 minutes later . They say Rodolfo Marquez , accompanied by Villagrana and armed with a gun Manuel Marquez had given him , entered the bar and began shooting , while Manuel Marquez waited in a getaway truck outside . Oscar Lemus , 34 , of Los Angeles and Jose Davila , 33 , of Glendale were killed , and Javier Maldonado , 48 , of Los Angeles , was wounded .
