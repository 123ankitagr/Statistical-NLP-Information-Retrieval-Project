Those are pretty wild statistics quoted by Los Angeles Councilman Marvin Braude : `` 425,000 die from tobacco each year . . . . Smoking costs this country $ 65 billion a year '' ( Commentary , July 21 ) . How can anyone obtain these precise figures ? Has each smoker got a nicotine meter attached to his body ? How about people who die from caffeine in coffee and tea ? Why is n't this drug taxed ? Because all politicians drink it ? Smokers contribute $ 10 billion a year in taxes . Who would make up this loss and how many would be unemployed if tobacco were banned ? How about the smokers who 've lived to a ripe old age ? Does do-gooder Braude know about the study showing that kids , by the age of 10 , have damaged lungs from smog , not tobacco . All of us have to breathe this foul toxic air that is killing all of us , yet Braude and other politicians condemn smokers as more dangerous ! Have smokers no rights ? Where is the ACLU in this matter ? When will these picayune politicians concern themselves with the real problems destroying our society , like pornography and obscenity , and stop harassing taxpaying smokers ? I am going on 80 , and have been smoking for 60 years . If the Braude bunch intends to prohibit tobacco , somebody better tell them what Prohibition did to this country . SIDNEY REED Hawthorne
