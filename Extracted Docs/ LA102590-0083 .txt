Postmaster Jennifer Willis wears a blue smock of her own choosing . Because rural postal employees do n't get a uniform allowance , they can pick their own work clothes , within reason . Her glasses are held together with a paper clip . She does n't use much makeup , and she wears her brown hair long and straight . By noon , roughly a dozen people have visited the single window in the small cube of a building that serves as Palomar Mountain 's post office . Willis , 47 , knows every one of them . She has lived and worked on the mountain 22 years . After years as a clerk , she was made postmaster 10 years ago . There 's no home mail delivery on Palomar Mountain . Willis ' postal branch has 228 post office boxes , two-thirds of which are rented . Palomar Mountain is n't a place for people who need to be entertained . There is no movie theater , although the local store rents videos . The only restaurant is a vegetarian place owned by the Spiritual World Society . The nearest pizza joint is 30 miles away . There 's no cable television . `` They just use our mountain to bounce their signals off of , '' Willis said . And there 's no newspaper delivery . `` My idea of a perfect day off is to spend the day at home , '' Willis said . `` Sundays , I generally catch up on my sleep . '' Peace and quiet are the primary attractions here . Her job occasionally stretches to include tasks unknown to an urban postmaster , like the time she weighed a newborn baby on her postal scale . `` I 'll probably stay until I get too old to gather firewood , '' said Willis .
