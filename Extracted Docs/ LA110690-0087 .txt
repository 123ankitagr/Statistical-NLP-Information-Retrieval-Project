Former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt arrived in this capital Monday night on a personal mission to win the release of hundreds of Iraqi-held hostages . Brandt traveled in a chartered Lufthansa Airbus that can carry about 250 people , bearing flowers and letters from relatives of the estimated 400 German hostages . Also on board were four aides and two tons of medicine for Iraq donated by German companies . The British , Belgian and Dutch governments have criticized the journey , and Brandt has been unable to stir up much support outside Germany for the trip . The German government said it backs the journey even though the 12-nation European Community last week stated there should be no negotiations with Baghdad on hostages . The Netherlands has asked Italy to call an EC foreign ministers ' meeting out of concern that missions such as Brandt 's undermine Western resolve against Iraq . Brandt , honorary head of the opposition Social Democrats in Germany and a Nobel Peace Prize winner , says his trip is a private mission and that he is not going to Baghdad as a representative of Chancellor Helmut Kohl 's government .
