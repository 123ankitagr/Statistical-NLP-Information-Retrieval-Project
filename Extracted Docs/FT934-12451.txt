the suggestion by mr henning christophersen the european communitys economic affairs commissioner of 2 per cent growth in the ec next year was branded as overoptimistic by private sector economists yesterday amid signs that it is incompatible with the latest internal ec commission forecasts on monday mr christophersen told journalists at the ec finance ministers meeting in luxembourg that ecwide growth could be between 15 per cent and 2 per cent next year if the latest german growth forecasts turned out to be accurate however it emerged while mr christophersen was making his prediction that commission forecasters in brussels were starting a twoday meeting with colleagues from ec member states armed with internal commission forecasts pointing to less than 1 per cent ecwide growth in 1994 mr christophersen appeared to base his remarks on projections by five of germanys six leading economic research institutes forecasting 15 per cent growth in germany next year such a growth rate would boost ecwide economic growth by about 045 per cent but according to ec officials the commissioner seemed not to take into account internal commission forecasts that have downgraded 1994 growth from 125 per cent published in june to less than 1 per cent while this weeks forecasters meeting might lead to an upgrading of the commission forecast past experience suggests that any change would be small and typically around 02 percentage points mr christophersens suggestion that growth could reach 2 per cent surprised ec finance ministries yesterday because he had not mentioned it during mondays meeting private sector economists also doubted whether his upbeat forecast was soundly based mr george magnus international economist of s g warburg securities in london said mr christophersens forecast was wishful thinking and that 1 per cent ec growth was just about achievable mr martin hufner chief economist of bayerische vereinsbank in munich said 2 per cent growth looked very optimistic the german growth forecasts on which mr christophersen based his remarks are contentious they were rejected by one of the six german institutes and criticised by the association of german private banks as being too optimistic
