Thomas J. McDermott , a co-founder of Four Star Television Inc. , which once had 11 shows in prime time each week , has died of a heart attack at his Santa Monica home . Jim Mahoney , a longtime friend , said the onetime advertising executive whose agency , Benton & Bowles Inc. , bought more than $ 5 billion worth of television time , was 65 when he died Saturday . Creator and/or producer of shows ranging from `` Father Knows Best '' to the daytime serials `` The Edge of Night '' and `` As the World Turns , '' McDermott once was responsible for all network programming for Procter & Gamble and General Foods Corp. , two of the largest sponsors in broadcasting history . In 1959 , he left advertising and with Dick Powell , Charles Boyer and David Niven formed Four Star Television , an outgrowth of the old Four Star Playhouse . ( Ida Lupino had been the fourth member of the Playhouse entertainment team , but when the company turned to production the title was retained , although there were only three `` stars '' remaining . ) McDermott , who became president after Powell 's death in 1963 , helped create or produce `` Wanted : Dead or Alive , '' `` Zane Grey Theatre , '' `` The Rifleman , '' `` The Rogues , '' `` Dante '' and `` The Big Valley . '' After Four Star was sold in 1970 he joined RCA . He left six years later to form a production partnership with Jack Wrather for movies and TV films . After Wrather 's death in 1985 he bought out the Wrather library , which included the `` Lassie '' and `` Lone Ranger '' series and formed Southbrook Entertainment Corp . It was sold in 1987 for $ 40 million . Survivors include his wife , Anne , a daughter and two sons , who ask donations in his name to St. Jude 's Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tenn .
