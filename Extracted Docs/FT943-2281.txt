On the heels of Apple Computer 's decision to license its proprietary Macintosh personal computer operating system software to other PC companies , a California appeals court has thrown out Apple 's charges that Microsoft's competing Windows PC operating system , and related software from Hewlett-Packard , infringe Apple copyrights . The copyright infringement suit , filed six years ago , was part of Apple's efforts in the past to protect the 'look and feel ' of the Macintosh software which - until the introduction of Microsoft 's Windows in 1987 - gave Apple a competitive advantage over IBM and other PC makers . That advantage has long since been lost , with Microsoft 's Windows now the standard operating system for all IBM-compatible PCs . However , by licensing its software to other PC manufacturers , Apple hopes to regain lost ground . Initially , Apple will license its core Mac OS and elements of its PowerPC hardware design which until now have been unique to its own products , to companies that are not direct competitors in markets where Apple has limited distribution and in specialised market segments . The company said 'over time ' it aims to license its technology more broadly . Already 'about six companies ' have signed licensing agreements , Apple said , but refused to identify the licensees other than to say that they are equally divided among the US , Europe and Asia . The first Macintosh-style products from third parties are expected to be introduced by late 1995 .
