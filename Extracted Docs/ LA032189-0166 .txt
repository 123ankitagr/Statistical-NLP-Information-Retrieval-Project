Calgary Flames right wing Mark Hunter was suspended for three games without pay today for hitting New York Rangers defense man Michel Petit with his stick in a game March 13 , the NHL announced . League Executive Vice President Brian O'Neill said Hunter `` deliberately swung his stick at the back of his opponent and with sufficient force to cause him to fall to the ice . `` Even though the blow did not result in serious injury , the player must be responsible for his actions . '' The suspension would take effect March 28 but can begin immediately if the Flames agree to waive the seven-day period in which an appeal may be filed . Hunter , 26 , has 22 goals and eight assists in 62 games with Calgary this season .
