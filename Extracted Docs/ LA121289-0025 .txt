After months of protests by the NAACP that blacks are not represented in top administrative posts in Carson city government , City Administrator Jack Smith has chosen a black woman , Lorraine A. Oten , as finance director . Smith said Oten , whose salary range in her new job is $ 60,000 to $ 77,000 , `` was selected solely on her experience and skills . '' But he added that he is pleased that Oten , who is leaving a position as finance director of Lynwood , will add balance to Carson 's administrative team . `` It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out for more representation , '' he said . In Carson city government , four white men and an Asian man are the other appointed department heads . Smith is white and the deputy city administrator is an Asian man . The elected city clerk is an Asian woman , and the elected city treasurer is a white woman .
