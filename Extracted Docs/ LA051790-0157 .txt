Southern Pacific May Leave San Francisco : Southern Pacific Transportation Co. may sell its downtown headquarters and transfer some or all of its 1,800 workers out of San Francisco , spokesman Jim Loveland said . The sale could help relieve the company 's burden of about $ 500 million in acquisition debt . But Loveland said offers for the building triggered the company 's review of a possible sale . `` We 're going to analyze the process by which we might sell the building and move to less expensive headquarters -- possibly in the Bay Area or possibly outside , '' Loveland said .
