eight years ago when political tensions were high and chinas economic reforms scarcely under way the special economic zone of xiamen booked 10 telephone calls a month to taiwan 200km away today calls are averaging 60000 a month and rising in 1987 when taiwan lifted martial law and eased some restrictions on dealings with china fewer than 7000 taiwanese visited the mainland bilateral trade which can legally be conducted only through third countries was about usdollars 15bn pounds 877m this year with rules on investment in china slowly being relaxed more than 1m taiwanese are expected to visit bilateral trade through hong kong alone is likely to exceed dollars 6bn while the total including smuggling will be closer to dollars 10bn taiwanese light industrial and processing companies faced with rising wages and costs at home have probably invested more than dollars 3bn in china in the last five years about a third has gone into the city of xiamen and fujian province and about the same is invested in guangdong and shenzhen chinas most advanced special economic zone across kowloon bay from hong kong this explosion of economic activity has helped lift average wages in xiamen 10 per cent per year since 1987 taiwanese electronics toy and garment factories are springing up in and around xiamen and along the fujian coast in some areas more than a quarter of workers are employed by taiwan companies xiamen now resembles shenzhen five years ago similar problems such as gambling prostitution and corruption are also emerging but most xiamen residents seem to welcome home their taiwanese tongbao or compatriots who share language and often kinship ties each morning chinese peasants often brought to xiamen from poorer inland provinces file through the gates of the xinglin taiwanese investors zone takamisawa electric taiwan which started trial production of magnetic components earlier this year employs about 70 young chinese women on a production line with machinery mostly imported from japan mr lay chuanlin who moved to xiamen from taiwan to manage the factory says labour costs are about a tenth of those in taiwan and productivity is surprisingly high by next year the company intends to add another three production lines and employ 1000 workers although taiwans growing involvement in fujian mirrors hong kongs development of guangdong since the early 1980s taiwanese companies face different problems china still regards taiwan as a renegade province it refuses to recognise taiwans government and has not renounced its threat to use military force to reunify taiwan especially if the island declares independence these political concerns pose a host of problems and suggest moves towards closer economic integration will be erratic at best for example neither side recognises the others legal system so no investment protection guarantees are in place bans on direct shipping and air links and restrictions on direct investment and banking also add to businesses costs these are acceptable risks for lowcost manufacturers who may face going out of business if they stay in taiwan their average investment is less than dollars 10m and some are also speculating on rising land prices machinery which has sometimes already been fully depreciated can be moved to china where low wage and land costs allow healthy margins even after the extra costs of political restrictions but for capital intensive industries the risks of investing in china are significant investment guarantees can be secured via overseas subsidiaries but companies face legal and political problems while hong kong companies rush to build power stations and roads in guangdong taiwanese investors have so far shunned longterm infrastructure projects some heavy industries such as petrochemicals will invest if offered sufficient incentives by china but progress is likely to be slow chinas renewed commitment to coastal economic reform this year means it has become even keener on attracting taiwanese investment to provide jobs and technology defence experts in hong kong and taiwan suspect chinas policy of attacking the us while largely ignoring taiwan over the recent f16 fighter jet sale shows beijing does not want to risk upseting taiwanese investors at this stage but growing chinese links are worrying taiwans government with 7 per cent of the islands exports now officially destined for the mainland the government fears china is gaining a significant indirect influence over its economy changes in chinas economic policies and its trade disputes with the us will now affect taiwan for the first time taiwans ruling kuomintang party has tried to stop largescale investments in china by reviewing them on a case by case basis defence industries will not be allowed to leave and strategic industries such as petrochemicals and cement are being encouraged to invest in special preferential zones in taiwan whatever our businessmen do on the mainland their roots should remain in taiwan said kuomintang spokesman mr james chu so far the government has had mixed success it claims it persuaded formosa plastics taiwans largest private company to cancel plans to invest in xiamen in fact formosa probably delayed because china had not agreed to its conditions other large companies such as food manufacturer president are investing throughout china and government officials admit privately they can not stop businessmen for long taiwan is meant to be a free country one said the taiwanese government therefore seems to have decided its ban on direct shipping air and postal links is its best chance of limiting investment china wants the ban lifted to increase investment and push reunification one step closer but taiwan wants to keep maintain the ban which is perhaps its only hope of squeezing concessions from china in the future meanwhile china seems unwilling to play its own trump card removing the threat of force mr chen kongli director of taiwan research at xiamen university said taiwan had to make concessions before the threat would be lifted chinas government also sees the threat as a way to suppress taiwans independence movement he said taiwans straits exchange foundation set up to discuss issues such as document verification and trade disputes with the chinese complains that each time progress on improving the relationship between the two sides has been close china has raised unacceptable demands on sovereignty by claiming there is only one china thereby negating taiwans existence the problem became urgent earlier this year when three taiwanese managers were arrested by chinese police following a fight at their factory they were later released without charge legal protection of taiwanese people and property remains very tenuous said mr chen rongjye secretarygeneral of the sef
