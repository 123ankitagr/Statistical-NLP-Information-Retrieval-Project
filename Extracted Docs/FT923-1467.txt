A FRESH European Community effort is under way to find a name under which the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia can be given international recognition without offending Greece . Mr Robin O'Neill , a British diplomat , is holding talks today in Skopje , the Macedonian capital , after meeting Greek officials in Athens last week . Mr Kiro Gligorev , the Macedonian president , has so far ruled out a name change after the refusal of the EC , under pressure from Greece , to recognise the republic under the name of Macedonia . Nevertheless , other EC members remain sceptical of the Greek argument that Macedonia 's choice of an ancient Greek name amounts to a territorial claim on the modern Greek province of Macedonia . Mr Gligorev will probably be asked to compromise on a double name : Macedonia would be recognised abroad under a different name , while at home it could still call itself Macedonia .
