A senior Russian general who supports military dictatorship and backs a muscular role for the Russian army in the former Soviet republics is set to lose his job , military officials said yesterday . The predicted removal of Gen Alexander Lebed , commander of Russian forces in the break-away Transdnestr region of Moldova , suggests the Kremlin is seeking to remove hardliners from the military . However , other Russian military officers denied Gen Lebed was being forced out . Relations between Gen Lebed , who has said he will not stay in the military if he is removed from his post , and the Kremlin reached a nadir last month after the general told Izvestia , the Russian daily newspaper , that Russia invited attack through its military weakness and described all Russian politicians , including President Boris Yeltsin , as 'minuses ' .
