A reader has an alternative theory , though , as to why John Paul Getty II should have rushed so willingly to the damsels ' side . Was the anglophile cricketing enthusiast , who promised to fork out Pounds 1m to keep the work in the UK , fondly reminded of that other troika of Graces , William Gilbert , and his brothers , Edward Mills and George Frederick ? While the exploits of WG , the 19th century 's greatest cricketer , are well known , his elder brother Edward preceded him as England 's best batsman . Moreover , in 1880 , all three Graces assembled at The Oval to face Australia in what was the first test played in England . Sadly , there is no evidence that the family possessed any special literary or artistic bent . WG was well ahead of his time in employing the services of a ghost writer to help compile his history of the sport .
