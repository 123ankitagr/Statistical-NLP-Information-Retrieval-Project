what's in a name the answer is a touch more than dollars 31.2 bn pounds 16.30 bn if it happens to be marlboro the philip morris-owned cigarette brand is the most valuable in the world according to a new assessment of brand values to be published next month by financial world the us business magazine coca-cola occupies the number two slot at dollars 24.4 bn it is worth more than twice as much as its rival pepsi-cola which is ranked fourth at dollars 9.6 bn the list is published just as controversy has flared again in the uk over the question of brand values terry smith head of research at ubs phillips drew the securities house was suspended from his job last week after his criticism of a number of legal accounting practices which he claims could give a misleading impression of a company's financial position the practices include that of capitalising brands as intangible assets in the balance sheet accountants finance directors and marketing directors have been at odds over the issue since the nestle bid for rowntree in 1988 raised questions about the market valuation of such rowntree brands as kitkat and quality street since then a number of leading uk companies including grand metropolitan guinness ranks hovis mcdougall and united biscuits have put at least some of their brands in the balance sheet guinness for instance does not capitalise its beer brand valued at dollars 2.28 bn and ranked 17 th in the world by the us survey the drinks group recognises only acquired brands such as johnnie walker and bell's scotch whiskies gordon's gin and asbach brandy which have a clear benchmark for valuation identifiable earnings and could be sold separately ian duncan guinness's managing director finance and administration says i have no doubt that our practice of recognising acquired brands in our balance sheet is correct and i believe it is becoming widely accepted that brands like ours with a wide international consumer franchise are real substantial and highly valuable assets just as much as and indeed sometimes more so than property and plant which can be subject to more risk of obsolescence much of the criticism of brand valuation has focused on the judgements used in calculating values and one or two oddities emerge from the financial world estimates the magazine bases its approach on methods devised by interbrand the uk consultancy to find marlboro's brand value for example it first estimated the brand's annual operating profit dollars 3.4 bn based on sales of pounds 15.4 bn and a profit margin of 22 per cent it then calculated that a non-branded cigarette employing the same capital as marlboro would have made profits of only dollars 462 m this amount was deducted from marlboro's dollars 3.4 bn operating profits leaving dollars 2.9 bn after a 43 per cent provision for taxes the final figure of dollars 1.7 bn was deemed to be the net brand-related profits the dollars 1.7 bn was then multiplied by a factor of brand strength dependent on market position overall market prospects degree of internationalism and marketing support the marlboro multiple picked from a range of 12-20 was 19, giving a brand value of dollars 31.6 bn using these methods the survey ranks guinness's johnnie walker red label the world's best-selling scotch 14 th in its list of brands with a value of dollars 2.54 bn pounds 1.32 bn and gordon's gin in 28 th place at dollars 1.1 bn pounds 578 m the total value of the two brands is far above the pounds 1.39 bn balance sheet value that guinness puts on all its spirits such disparities illustrate the problems attached to brand accounting with which the accountancy profession is still wrestling but the problems need not detract from the use of brand valuation as an aid to management the debate on brand values in the us has centred not on their place in corporate financial reporting but on their use as a counter to undue emphasis on short-term financial performance the feeling persists among marketing managers that profit-based performance measures encourage actions such as over-pricing or extensive sales promotions that produce quick profits but erode long-term brand values
