to see charles dickens's a christmas carol onstage is to know again with a frisson of joy how theatrical its author's instincts were what i wonder would he have made of the coup de theatre with which the royal shakespeare company's new version of a christmas carol opens the panoramic view of london in dark silhouette dominated by the dome of st paul's lifts yards into the sky and from the blackness beneath there emerge people also in black in bible black indeed for marley's funeral i hope dickens would have marvelled at all this and at much that follows in ian judge's staging of john mortimer's new adaptation this christmas carol following the haunting rsc precedent of trevor nunn's nicholas nickleby proceeds on three main levels as a series of stage pictures as a stage elucidation of dickens's text and as a collage of victorian christmas music sometimes the three come thrillingly together as when scrooge snuffs out the spirit of christmas past we see the conical snuffing-cap pushing the spirit down into and through the ground we follow scrooge's exhausting travail much as dickens described it and meanwhile the scene is watched by a chorus of victorians in black who sing hark the herald angels sing with warning fierceness the melodramatic excitement the psychological intensity the sense of christmas as a jubilantly lyrical experience that is being threatened by scrooge all these are there together visually the production is consistently excellent thanks in particular to john gunter's set deirdre clancy's costumes and nigel levings's lighting verbally mortimer's text is first-rate he is plainly in love with dickens as both sound and sense and so are most of judge's rsc actors most of them playing several roles each a pity that he lets them make too little of some lines scrooge carried his own low temperature always about with him and some episodes belle breaking off her engagement to a younger scrooge but where the production is more frequently flawed is with nigel hess's music most of the onstage singing is weak but the taped music and orchestrations are worse the difference a few live instruments and less amplification would make as an arranger he could have struck more gold from his material but since his material is mainly the classic christmas carols we all know the perfect dickensian fusion of generosity and sentiment is achieved now and then clive francis is a first-rate scrooge an antique crustacean who manages to glow friskily once he learns to drop his shell paul greenwood and polly james do good work as the tender cratchit parents as do philip quast and sara weymouth as scrooge's laughing nephew and his wife cherry morris and peter warnock as the bubbling old fezziwigs the spirit of christmas present john kane is too bombastic and christmas past stephen jean too mild they should be virgil to scrooge's dante marley's ghost so plainly modelled on hamlet's papa is over-miked and under-chained but the 18-foot christmas yet to come hooded and cloaked like a grim reaper with only two skeletal claws visible is splendid the party scenes are all infectious and the finale with snow falling through the hovering christmas trees and rooftops onto the cast whose black attire is now illumined by scarlet winter scarves is ideal barbican theatre ec2
