the bundesbank has fuelled expectations of a further cut in interest rates by softening the emphasis it places on one of its key indicators in the growth of money supply german economists say the german central bank is drawing back from its earlier insistence that the m3 measure of money supply which includes cash in circulation current accounts and short-term deposits should be regarded as the most important indicator of domestic monetary stability it is undoubtedly a change in the bundesbank tone said mr wolfgang scheremet of the diw economic research institute in berlin they are preparing a change in direction we expect the bank to cut its rates but we are not sure when once they have changed direction they usually move fairly swiftly in the same direction with a series of decisions in a relatively short space of time the central bank's tough interest-rate policy has been based largely on its concern that m3 growth at 9 per cent was well outside its target range of 3.5 5.5 per cent german economists however say bundesbank statements this week on special factors affecting m3 growth and a clear policy by the bank in recent days to keep very short-term interest rates below 9 per cent are possible precursors to further cuts in the lombard and discount rates the latest indications have come in policy statements from mr hans tietmeyer vice-president of the bundesbank and from mr otmar issing a fellow director and leading monetary hawk on the ruling council they follow a rising tide of criticism from german economists at the bank's excessively rigid adherence to the m3 measure of money supply on the ground that it has been distorted by the processes of unification mr tietmeyer said that the bundesbank was very conscious that the discussion about the measurement of the growth in money supply is influenced by some special considerations they include not only the expansion of credit in east germany and the definition of a money supply target after reunification but also the quality of the m3 measure of money supply as an indicator given an inverse interest-rate structure and the effects of currency inflows the inverse interest rate structure refers to the fact that the bank's high interest rate policy has kept short-term rates above long-term rates encouraging investors to switch to short-term deposits which are themselves part of the m3 measure m3 is and remains for us naturally one important measure for monetary policy he confirmed but he added we know that there are currently a series of other factors which must be taken into account and watched closely
