of greed and excess but as puritans moralists and rightthinking people exclaimed in disgust some remained silent many women could understand imelda after all some knew that their own closets were crammed with shoes given imeldas illgotten resources who is to say that they too would not have managed to accumulate a similar number some women have a shoe thing it is not really a guilty secret it

imperative or as the shoe designer manolo blahnik puts it a fine shoe is an essential part of fashionable dress it can provide an accent to an outfit whether witty solemn provocative or simply elegant dress designers know that the right shoes are a crucial ingredient to a successful look and the wrong shoes can wreck an outfit as fashion changes its proportions every element of dress changes the woman in the wine bar was wearing a tight mini skirt and a jacket with square shoulders she had decided to pass on long skirts and the soft slender outline of 1993 the look which demands clumpy shoes and looks frumpy with spikeheeled court shoes so she was right about her needs few of us are so impervious to fashions swings most of us have clambered aboard a pair of platforms so to a certain

is a phallic symbol there is also the way high heels affect the wearers gait and posture emphasising the hips and buttocks arching the back thrusting the bosom forward lengthening the leg tightening the calf muscle and focusing attention on the ankle fragile ankles and small feet are feminine and in terms of dress anything which reinforces gender differences is sexy unfortunately nowadays most
