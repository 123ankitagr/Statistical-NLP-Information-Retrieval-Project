Inglewood officials are hoping the `` All-America City Award '' that the city won recently along with nine other municipalities nationwide will go a long way toward polishing the city 's image . City officials say they will use the honor to publicize Inglewood as a middle-class , multi-ethnic city where residents and officials have joined to reduce crime and beat back drug dealers . The city will advertise the award by adding the `` All-America '' designation to everything from official city stationery to street signs and the prominent `` Welcome to Inglewood '' sign that greets visitors at the city 's Manchester Boulevard entrance . `` You 'll definitely know you 're in an All-America city , '' said Mayor Edward Vincent . `` We 're going to have it on our driveways , our storefronts -- we 're going to have it everywhere that we 're an All-America city . '' Inglewood was the only city in California to receive the honor , given annually by the National Civic League , after a two-day competition with 109 other applicants in Chicago .
