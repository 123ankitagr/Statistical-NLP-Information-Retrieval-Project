investigations into the tanker exxon valdez disaster in alaskas prince william sound on march 24 will continue for months but the angry comment of one fishing boat captain on april 12 helps to explain a major part of the problem we are out here working our hearts out without accomplishing anything because theres no one in charge and thats the real problem that was nearly three weeks after the grounding of the exxon valdez on bligh reef on the next day admiral paul a yost the commandant of the us coast guard arrived in valdez to take charge of the federal governments role in the cleanup of the 240000barrel oil spill at last someone could be seen actually giving some orders still yost was only in charge of the federal governments role in the cleanup not in charge period president bush had declined and continues to decline to take full control of the situation up until yosts arrival exxon still had not issued any comprehensive cleanup plan in fact the giant oil firm did not do so until last weekend after yost had demanded one even then both yost and alaskan state officials questioned the sufficiency of the plan to clean crude oil from beaches only in prince william sound by this week the slick had spread well beyond the sound as far as 250 miles from valdez and had lapped onto the shores of two national parks theres no one in charge that seems to have been a critical problem from the moment that the exxon valdez ran onto the reef a little less than three hours after leaving valdez the terminal of the transalaska pipeline system with 126 million barrels of oil aboard bound for long beach at the outset alyeska pipeline service co the consortium of seven oil companies that operates the pipeline and oil terminal was responsible for responding to an oilspill emergency the consortiums prepared contingency plan had offered assurance that any spill in the sound would be contained within five hours it was clear that a speedy response was critical but alyeskas standby emergency oil team was abolished in the early 1980s to save money the coast guard log of the oil spill tells the rest of the story more than seven hours after the accident at 727 am on march 24 an alyeska helicopter reported observing a slick 1000 feet wide and 4to5 miles long at 950 am the coast guard noted that alyeska boats were under way with estimated arrival at the exxon valdez at 1 pm the first alyeska equipment actually arrived at 230 pm and the ship was not finally surrounded by a containment boom until 11 am on saturday march 25 or 35 hours after the accident had any such spill occurred in san pedro bay as the exxon valdez navigated into the port of long beach the coast guard would have been immediately and fully in charge this is what should have occurred in valdez on march 24 nearly one month afterward this is still what should occur
