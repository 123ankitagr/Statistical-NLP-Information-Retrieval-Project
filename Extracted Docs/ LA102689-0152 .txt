columbia savings loan the beverly hills thrift that has bet heavily on highyield highrisk junk bonds to produce profits disclosed a $ 2263million quarterly loss wednesday stemming from the recent hammering of the junk bond market combined with the effect of new federal thrift regulations in taking the loss for the third quarter ended sept 30 columbia is devaluing its junk bonds and other investments by $ 357 million a reflection of the sagging prices that the bonds are fetching in the market columbia executives said the thrifts junk bond portfolio is now valued at $ 375 billion or about 30 of columbias $ 127 billion in total assets under normal circumstances columbia would not have to devalue the bonds to their market values and suffer a loss provided that it could make a case that it planned to hold the junk bonds until they mature instead of selling them to investors but columbia is prohibited from holding most of its bonds to maturity by the new thrift legislation signed into law by president bush in august that law requires columbia and other thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds before july 1 1994 about 85 of columbias junk bonds mature after that date junk bond prices have suffered in recent weeks from a number of developments a major one being problems surfacing at highprofile junk bondfinanced concerns such as robert campeaus allied stores and merv griffins resorts international investors also are growing reluctant to buy junk bonds because of economic uncertainty and the recent stock market turmoil which tends to chase investors away from riskier investments into safer ones columbia under the leadership of chief executive thomas spiegel has forged close ties to drexel burnham lambert and its junk bond division riding the boom in junk bonds earlier this decade to huge profits columbia for several years has been one of the nations most profitable thrifts earning $ 1935 million in 1986 alone specifically columbia is pumping $ 2273 million into its reserves for losses that it expects on its holdings beyond that columbia is marking down the value of its overall junk bond portfolio by an additional $ 1302 million the $ 2263million quarterly loss a record for columbia contrasts with a profit of $ 163 million earned a year earlier in the nine months ended sept 30 columbia lost $ 212 million in contrast with a profit of $ 487 million in the yearearlier period columbia is not the only thrift to write down its junk bonds imperial corp of america the san diegobased parent of imperial savings earlier disclosed its aftertax losses from its junk bond holdings will total $ 889 million for the quarter some 200 thrifts nationwide own junk bonds although none hold anywhere near the amount owned by columbia analysts have estimated that thrifts may write down as much as $ 1 billion in their portfolios they might as well step up to the line and take it said donald h livingstone a partner in los angeles with the arthur andersen co accounting firm columbia said there was no pressure from regulators to increase reserves for the junkbond holdings executives added that they chose to devalue its entire portfolio including those bonds that mature before 1994 to give it flexibility in selling them despite the loss columbia executives said the thrifts capital position remains strong well in excess of federal standards required under the new thrift bailout as of sept 30 columbias tangible equity as a percentage of its assets stood at 36 meaning that the thrift has about $ 360 of its own money invested for every $ 100 in assets that number however is down from 52 before the accounting adjustments were made columbia said it believes that after it makes it accounting adjustments it will rank third in its percentage of equity to capital among california thrifts behind great western and home federal in addition columbia executives said the thrift holds valuable assets in the form of warrants options and other securities issued in corporate buyouts and restructurings they said those securities cost $ 90 million but are expected to ultimately produce gains of $ 200 million to $ 300 million columbia executives said they wrote off about $ 356 million in junk bond investments in the quarter the amount of which was taken out of the reserve columbias reserves against junk bond losses which act as a cushion now total $ 300 million or nearly 7 of its junk bond portfolio columbia executives said they believe that amount is more than adequate accountants and analysts said it is difficult to determine whether the amount is enough because columbias operation is so different from those of other thrifts due to its junk bond activity and the fact its bond holdings are a closely guarded secret
