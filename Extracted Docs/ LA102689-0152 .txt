columbia savings loan the beverly hills thrift that has bet heavily on high-yield high-risk junk bonds to produce profits disclosed a 226.3 million quarterly loss wednesday stemming from the recent hammering of the junk bond market combined with the effect of new federal thrift regulations in taking the loss for the third quarter ended sept 30, columbia is devaluing its junk bonds and other investments by 357 million a reflection of the sagging prices that the bonds are fetching in the market columbia executives said the thrift's junk bond portfolio is now valued at 3.75 billion or about 30 of columbia's 12.7 billion in total assets under normal circumstances columbia would not have to devalue the bonds to their market values and suffer a loss provided that it could make a case that it planned to hold the junk bonds until they mature instead of selling them to investors but columbia is prohibited from holding most of its bonds to maturity by the new thrift legislation signed into law by president bush in august that law requires columbia and other thrifts to divest themselves of junk bonds before july 1, 1994 about 85 of columbia's junk bonds mature after that date junk bond prices have suffered in recent weeks from a number of developments a major one being problems surfacing at high-profile junk bond-financed concerns such as robert campeau's allied stores and merv griffin's resorts international investors also are growing reluctant to buy junk bonds because of economic uncertainty and the recent stock market turmoil which tends to chase investors away from riskier investments into safer ones columbia under the leadership of chief executive thomas spiegel has forged close ties to drexel burnham lambert and its junk bond division riding the boom in junk bonds earlier this decade to huge profits columbia for several years has been one of the nation's most profitable thrifts earning 193.5 million in 1986 alone specifically columbia is pumping 227.3 million into its reserves for losses that it expects on its holdings beyond that columbia is marking down the value of its overall junk bond portfolio by an additional 130.2 million the 226.3 million quarterly loss a record for columbia contrasts with a profit of 16.3 million earned a year earlier in the nine months ended sept 30, columbia lost 212 million in contrast with a profit of 48.7 million in the year-earlier period columbia is not the only thrift to write down its junk bonds imperial corp of america the san diego-based parent of imperial savings earlier disclosed its after-tax losses from its junk bond holdings will total 88.9 million for the quarter some 200 thrifts nationwide own junk bonds although none hold anywhere near the amount owned by columbia analysts have estimated that thrifts may write down as much as 1 billion in their portfolios they might as well step up to the line and take it said donald h livingstone a partner in los angeles with the arthur andersen co accounting firm columbia said there was no pressure from regulators to increase reserves for the junk-bond holdings executives added that they chose to devalue its entire portfolio including those bonds that mature before 1994, to give it flexibility in selling them despite the loss columbia executives said the thrift's capital position remains strong well in excess of federal standards required under the new thrift bailout as of sept 30, columbia's tangible equity as a percentage of its assets stood at 3.6 meaning that the thrift has about 3.60 of its own money invested for every 100 in assets that number however is down from 5.2 before the accounting adjustments were made columbia said it believes that after it makes it accounting adjustments it will rank third in its percentage of equity to capital among california thrifts behind great western and home federal in addition columbia executives said the thrift holds valuable assets in the form of warrants options and other securities issued in corporate buyouts and restructurings they said those securities cost 90 million but are expected to ultimately produce gains of 200 million to 300 million columbia executives said they wrote off about 35.6 million in junk bond investments in the quarter the amount of which was taken out of the reserve columbia's reserves against junk bond losses which act as a cushion now total 300 million or nearly 7 of its junk bond portfolio columbia executives said they believe that amount is more than adequate accountants and analysts said it is difficult to determine whether the amount is enough because columbia's operation is so different from those of other thrifts due to its junk bond activity and the fact its bond holdings are a closely guarded secret columbia
