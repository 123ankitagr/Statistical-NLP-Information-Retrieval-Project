China Expected to Resume GAAT Talks : China is expected to resume efforts soon to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , GATT 's director-general said . Arthur Dunkel of Switzerland said that officials from China , whose application for GATT membership was temporarily shelved after the bloody crackdown on student-led protests in June , plan to hold discussions with GATT members about reviving talks on membership . China applied in 1986 to join GATT , a 96-nation market-oriented group whose members pledge to bring their policies in line with its free-trade rules .
