in 1967 a 13yearold actor named craig hundley was cast as captain kirks nephew in an episode of televisions star trek at that time he was plunging into dual careers as a tv actor he won roles in kung fu the flying nun and bewitched and as a prodigy pianist many years later he returned to the star trek saga in a very different role now a successful composer in the electronic music field he supplied some of the eerie sounds in the klingon sequence of the film star trek the motion picture he also worked on the synthesizer programming for parts of star trek ii and was involved with the movie series through star trek v today the onetime teenage whiz now 35 is at the center of his own musical and electronic empire now known as craig huxley he wanted to identify with the family of philosophers he owns a $ 3million recording studio in burbank named what else enterprise he records his own music and the music of countless others who use his studios he produces and performs during many of the sessions often using instruments he invented in some cases he releases the results on his own new age label sonic atmospheres or on his recently launched pop label sling shot records during his teen years hundleyhuxley was identified with jazz he even had a young trio that played at shellys manne hole but at around age 20 he says i got out of jazz because i couldnt stand what fusion was doing to it i found myself more interested in philosophy and in electronics and new age and the avantgarde then i began inventing and building instruments one of his more celebrated inventions heard during those weird interludes in star trek movies is the blaster beam its sounding board resonator along with magnets strings and an 18foot aluminum beam can create some of the strangest sounds ever heard some of them says huxley can be felt rather than heard as they go a whole octave lower than any note on the piano though he still occasionally plays piano huxleys world today is populated by synclaviers yamaha tx816s roland super jupiters a flexitonal clavichord and of course the blaster beam all of which can be heard in quantum mechanix a recent album in which he took part as leader composer arranger producer and engineer one of the participants in quantum mechanix is hyman katz who like huxley has become as much a businessman as a musician he is now general manager of sonic atmospheres he and huxley jammed together as children katz is the son of noted cellist fred katz who played in the original chico hamilton quintet here and there in this curious and intriguing cd along with effects that sometimes suggest a latterday toneddown counterpart of weather report are brief reminders of huxleys past associations saxophonists bud shank and bob sheppard are heard on several tracks for the most part though its spacemaster huxley whos clearly in charge more typical of huxleys catalogue which now includes 22 albums all available on cd are two contributions by don harriss considered one of the masters of new age pop whose elevations accorded good airplay and respectable sales was followed by vanishing points which has earned impassioned praise from the likes of john sebastian who programs for the radio station ktwv the wave harriss is a virtual oneman band with his steinway grand synclavier yamaha and macintosh computer and with engineer gary chase organizing the synclavier programming for such harriss pieces as sunlight samples and the rajahs tea party with people like don harriss michael stearns and l subramaniam says huxley we have a great line of albums what we have to contend with is the confusion about categories whether this or that album should be classified as adult contemporary aor albumoriented rock or whatever after four years of running the company we have a better product the only real hangup is distribution which seems to be a harder problem than ever but huxley has enough other irons in the fire to minimize any need to worry about the evolution of his label his studios are in constant use by other companies answering a phone call the other day he said ill have to call you back were busy in all four studios at the moment we have the doobie brothers in one room melissa manchester in a second tom jones in another and the flutist steve kujala is making an album in the fourth before the dream of building his own studios and record companies became a reality huxley had a long run as a performer and composer in tv and movies working on countless sessions with quincy jones michael jackson james ingram and other pop biggies for the movie dreamscape he produced the entire sound track working with the composer maurice jarre and programming the synthesizers he released the dreamscape sound track album on sonic atmospheres shortly afterward mgm hired him to coproduce the score for 2010 for which he collaborated with composer david shire on a predominantly electronic score despite the pressures of his multiple operations huxley continues to keep his hand in as a composer i still do knots landing about once a month with jerry immel as cocomposer and i collaborated with leon ware on writing and producing undercover which was the title number for leons album on sling shot records at present the sling shot label is more or less dormant but huxley and katz have come up with a third company sonic edge we want to use this for material that is so to speak on the cutting edge of todays developments says katz a surprising statement since it would hardly seem possible for anything to be more contemporary than what can already be found in the sonic atmosphere lists with his studios his record companies the composing and arranging and inventing and constant search for expansion and innovation huxley has succeeded in areas far beyond anything that was predicted for him during his years as a teenage piano prodigy and parttime actor today he is a successful businessman a husband father of a 2yearold daughter and at heart a musician who has never forgotten the old values you know he said i still play bill evans tapes in my car
