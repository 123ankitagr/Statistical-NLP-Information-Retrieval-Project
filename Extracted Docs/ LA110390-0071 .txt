a marine biologist diving near santa catalina island was startled to find an unfamiliar offwhitecolored starfish usually indigenous to the tropical waters of south america near point loma in san diego the waters are providing a unique harvest of such exotic species as yellowfin tuna and dorado prompting commercial fisherman lance withee to say he has never seen the ocean like this before and for surfers at newport beach swimming trunks often replace the fullbody wet suit normally de rigueur as southern california moves into the winter warmerthanaverage ocean temperatures off southern california as much as 10 degrees above normal on a given day are intriguing scientists fascinating fishermen and delighting surfers from santa barbara to mexico researchers at the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla say monthly average temperatures since june have topped normal temperatures by as much as five degrees the highest readings occurred in july were really excited about it said orange coast college marine biologist dennis kelly who has heard reports of unusual sea turtles and other warmwater creatures as close as four miles to newport pier it opens up a lot of doors for us for research no one is quite sure why the tropicallike waters have pushed ocean temperatures up and scientists are less willing to predict what the trend could mean for the future its a big ocean out there said biological oceanographer john mcgowan a member of the scripps climate research division there is so much going on that we just cant see some specialists suggest a shift in wind patterns may be the cause others point to a change in an ocean current still others are concerned that the warm water may be a harbinger of el nino a pacific ocean weather pattern that causes severe drought in some areas of the pacific rim and devastating storms in others southern california has experienced a slackening of strong westerly winds which normally blow across the ocean and churn the deeper colder water the resulting upwelling cools the shallower warm water without the wind the upper layer of ocean water becomes tepid an explanation offered by newport beach marine safety officer gordon c reed weve had little wind to speak of this year he said but others suggest that the warming is the result of an errant current that is also dragging to the southern california coastline an array of exotic marine life marine biologist jeff landsman with the cabrillo marine museum in san pedro said that he and other researchers have noted unusual ocean life that seems to be associated with the warm water thousands of south american humboldt squid were beached near san onofre in the summer he said another striking example was the discovery of the starfish a tamaria obstipa off catalina by landsmans colleague lloyd ellis the creature is native to coastal waters off peru finds like that have prompted landsman and other scientists to conclude that the warmerthannormal water might be the result of an offseason flow of the davidson countercurrent which pushes water northward from baja california in february theres too much out there to believe that its just the lack of winds landsman said i dont believe that its upwelling that is causing this whatever the reason the tropicallike waters have been a boon to such beachgoers as 19yearold jason smith an avid newport beach surfer on a recent day his wet suit lay unused nearby you dont even need the suit said his 18yearold friend rip arenz yeah the water is really warm i dont know why and sportfishermen are enjoying the bounty withee who owns and operates the vagabond an 80foot sportfishing boat out of point loma said he has caught tropical fish without having to travel hundreds of miles south its never before been like this withee said weve had a long bite of exotic species out there withee and other fishermen say that dorado are normally caught during a twoweek period in august but since may they have been bringing on board hundreds of the iridescent blueandgreen fish each day fishermen also report higher than normal concentrations of yellowtail tuna zeke grader executive director for the sausalitobased pacific coast federation of fishermens associations said the catches are helping the $ 15billion commercial fishing industry as well as sports fishermen but grader said that if the unseasonably warm temperatures continue important colderwater fish may be driven away for example experts say a small squid that spawns off santa catalina island in the winter would be threatened by the warmer water its hard to say whether we are looking at something unusual grader said but were watching very carefully the water conditions grader said that the last time warm water hurt the fishing industry was in 198283 when a strong el nino the worst such weather system in the century devastated the salmon harvest scripps researchers said that fears of an impending el nino are illplaced nick graham part of a team studying the phenomenon said the earliest an el nino could form would be next year scripps mcgowan also said the warm waters do not appear to be a sign that an el nino is beginning absent are other signs of the phenomenon called the el ninosouthern oscillation or enso which are found in the equatorial and eastern pacific regions for an el nino to take place graham said barometric pressure in the area of darwin australia must rise and pressure over tahiti must fall neither condition has occurred in addition el nino is associated with increased rainfall in the central equatorial pacific elevated sea surface temperatures from south america to the international date line and weaker easterly winds along the equator graham said we dont have all the other danger signals yet mcgowan said they are just not all in place
