members of europes leading nongovernmental organisations ngos last night met european environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest convention reports christina lamb in rio de janeiro forests are one of the most contentious issues of the summit and there has been little progress on bridging the northsouth divide on the subject with only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will be any agreement on deforestation which is continuing at a rate of 17m hectares a year mr andrew lees from friends of the earth said there was a danger the summit was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being negotiated simultaneously in rio forest devastation was continuing unhindered in the meantime a convention had to be dropped long before the summit and replaced by a nonbinding declaration of forest principles which says little other than that forests should be conserved and managed sustainably even this is causing controversy at the conference with developing countries led by malaysia seeing it as an infringement of their sovereignty ngos argue that the declaration is so weak as to be almost worthless particularly as it includes no firm commitment to halt deforestation the ngo demands presented to ministers last night include a commitment to follow up the principles with a legally binding instrument and to allow signatories to set up national policies against trade in unsustainable forest products
