i take serious objection to the oped article by paul craig roberts aug 15 which attacks stanford university i am a graduate of stanford undergraduate economics and a member of the board of overseers of the hoover institution i am a lifelong republican having served as a hoover overseer for four years i would characterize the mood of our board as extremely hopeful and positive looking forward while acknowledging that serious errors of tact and judgment have been committed by both hoover and stanford in recent years hoover director glenn campbell will always be a hero at hoover it is also in keeping with the philosophy of those other great members of the stanford family john gardner and ernie arbuckle to acknowledge that periodic change is healthy both institutionally and individually with respect to the reagan library it was accepted unanimously by the stanford trustees while there was considerable debate the faculty senate did not turn down the reagan library i would suggest that glenn campbells heroic impatience had as much to do with its demise at stanford as any other single entity labeling the stanford faculty leftist there was no place for moderates or reason either you hated america or were a war criminal is more revealing of the character of paul craig roberts than of the stanford faculty michael boskin hoover fellow senior faculty in economics and currently chairman of president bushs council of economic advisors as well as david brady hoover fellow senior faculty in political science and stanford business school are but two examples of the caliber of faculty slurred by roberts comments roberts goes on to criticize stanfords budgeting process deficits are planned for in the current university budget in order to absorb the extraordinary expense of raising $ 11 billion in the centennial campaign without curtailing the ongoing educational and research programs as to the centennial campaign roberts asserts stanfords fundraising efforts were running behind the weak performance of last year last years weak performance $ 1819 million was no 1 among private universities in the united states and well ahead of harvard for first place nationally it was the first billiondollar campaign ever announced by a university it has survived the stock market crash higher capital gains rates and even paul craig roberts hoover and stanford are two institutions which have contributed greatly to the west and to the world at large they will each contribute greatly in the future and they are worthy of our support what such worthy institutions need and deserve are individuals who are willing to live with their imperfections and work to make them better roberts laundry list of hackneyed provocative and unproven charges represents hidebound negative conservatism at its worst bowen h buzz mc coy los angeles
