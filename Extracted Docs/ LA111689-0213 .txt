Disease Detection International of Irvine has been given approval to sell test kits in Sweden that , according to the company , indicate in just seven minutes whether someone is infected with the AIDS virus . So far , the speediest test for acquired immune deficiency syndrome to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is one that takes about 90 minutes . Disease Detection said it intends to apply for FDA approval for its seven-minute kit early next year . Each kit is about the size of a credit card . To use it , a drop of blood is placed on the surface , to which a clinician adds several chemicals . Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) is indicated by a blue dot . Disease Detection President and Chief Executive H. Thad Morris said these kits are not intended for home use . The reason , Morris said , is the prevailing belief that HIV diagnoses should be made in settings where professional guidance is available . `` Our tests should only be used in the hands of professionals , '' Morris said .
