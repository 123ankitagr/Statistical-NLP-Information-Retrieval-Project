wildlife officials are proud of their work at the grizzly island wildlife area their herd of tule elk has grown to more than 100 since seven from the owens valley were introduced to the area in 1977 and the herd is still prospering river otters still swim playfully in the meandering waterways home also to giant white sturgeon and striped bass eagles and hawks soar over sprawling wetlands that support millions of giantsized jack rabbits all wideeyed and alert to the dangers of the territory natures ways are evident but mans are becoming increasingly evident too which concerns officials they say rampant development results in overcrowding and pollution furthermore the growing inability of hunters and fishermen to provide adequate funding for wildlife management and land acquisition makes it more difficult to protect the fragile areas we have 28 million people in california going to 40 million by the year 2010 director pete bontadelli said clearly the pressures on wildlife are greater than anything weve seen before given these projections bontadelli said the states ability to manage existing wildlands and the opportunity to make future land acquisitions is becoming more restricted in short revenue isnt keeping up with the rising costs of wildlife management the grizzly bear californias proud symbol of strength is long gone and officials fear more species native to the state might also become extinct the kit fox bald eagle and peregrine falcon to name a few are endangered fortunately through bond issues over the years californians have helped the state set aside about 400000 acres of precious wildlife habitat which bontadelli said supports many of these endangered and threatened species he claims however that such land is becoming more difficult to maintain another problem dfg officials might have to address in the near future involves a proposed cap on federal aid to the various states for wildlife management if the proposal included in the reagan administration budget for fiscal 1990 is passed by congress there would be $ 100million caps on both the dingelljohnson and pittmanrobertson funds federally relegated funds that support the states wildlife agencies the fund which began in 1937 raises money through taxes on sporting firearms and ammunition in the last fiscal year it raised $ 119 million for state agencies involved with wildlife restoration and hunter safety the pittmanrobertson fund is credited with creating modern game management agencies in the states the dingelljohnson program which began in 1950 and was expanded in 1984 under the wallopbreaux act raises money by taxing fishing tackle and boats it raised $ 1795 million last year among other things the money is used to acquire and improve habitat and restock species wiped out by excessive hunting or poor landmanagement practices the comebacks of the whitetail deer wild turkey and wood duck as well as the native brook trout and the cutthroat trout can be traced to the two programs in a statement released by the white house president bush said he would recommend to congress that the funds be used for the purposes intended said bontadelli were hopeful that congress will not allow the cap to take affect at this point its in congress hands in any case bontadelli emphasized that the department needs more money to assure the quality of wildlife for future generations some help has come through the california wildlands program it was dedicated at grizzly island feb 13 under the slogan save our wild places and is expected to be in full operation by april 1 aimed at increasing the states revenue by charging visitors not just hunters and fishermen to nine major wildlife areas the program is being hailed by conservation groups habitat loss is the greatest overall threat to californias wildlife said richard spotts california representative of defenders of wildlife traditional hunting and fishing revenues have not kept pace with the mounting conservation challenges tim egan president of the california waterfowl assn said were hoping that with this new program and others like it the rest of the public is going to make their contribution or else were going to lose a lot of resources we dont want to lose egan said only about 290000 acres of wetlands are left in california down from millions years ago suisun marsh which surrounds the dfgmanaged grizzly island has shrunk through erosion reclamation and agricultural and industrial development from 750000 acres to 85000 through the north american waterfowl management plan a joint united statescanada effort were trying to reestablish wetlands area in california and north america egan said now theyve got a money stream thats going to help us create more wetlands most of the support however will come from sales of annual and daily wildlife passes at $ 10 and $ 2 respectively and native species stamps which can be bought at dfg offices and sporting goods stores the passes will enable visitors at any of these wildlife areas to see firsthand enjoy watch and photograph such wildlife as tule elk bald eagles river otters white pelicans and flocks of waterfowl in a natural setting as george gamble of the california trappers assn put it its time for nonconsumptive users to lend their support wildlife interpreters as well as photography blinds nature trails and posted descriptions of wildlife are included in the price the eight other reserves are the lake earl wildlife area in del norte county ash creek wildlife area on the modoclassen county line gray lodge wildlife area in sutter and butte counties los banos wildlife area in merced county elkhorn slough ecological reserve on the monterey peninsula san jacinto wildlife area in riverside county upper newport bay ecological reserve in orange county and the imperialwister wildlife area in imperial county the grizzly island wildlife area lies in the heart of suisun marsh named years ago by the patwin indians who used to hunt and fish here the land of the west wind as it is appropriately called is home to 200 species of birds 45 species of mammals and 36 types of reptiles and amphibians the sprawling tidal wetlands are one of the countrys most important as much as 25 of the states wintering waterfowl might be concentrated here at one time shorteared owls ringnecked pheasants and ducks of all varieties there are 150 private hunting clubs in the area are part of the scenery as are numerous birds of prey including the majestic golden eagle the tule elk one of 20 herds in the state graze on prickly lettuce and grasses and being excellent swimmers can at times be seen crossing with grace the many sloughs and waterways that wind through the wetlands during mating season the bulls put on an impressive display of bugling and knocking horns in competition for their prospective harems though prospering now these animals serve as a reminder of how reckless disregard for wildlife can lead to the inadvertent extermination of a species tule elk are native to this area but were wiped out during the gold rush by the 49ers who according to wildlife supervisor dennis becker took away their habitat and used the animals for hides and food the present herd is but one example of how with proper management a species can be saved from extinction and managed effectively the question now however is whether the wildlands program will gain acceptance among the public and provide the necessary funds we are very comfortable that in the first 18 months we can generate at least $ 56 million bontadelli said to do that the department must sell 200000 outdoor passes and 100000 native species stamps a goal bontadelli believes is realistic in the long term i think thats where we need to be he said it will also provide a funding base for the marine mammal program threatened and endangered species programs fisheries management and much of our nongame program in wildlife management so this is critical for our wide variety of species needs and management objectives for the department
