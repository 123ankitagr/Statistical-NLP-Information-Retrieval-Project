TWO NEW warrant issues reflect increasing activity in emerging market debt derivatives , writes Tracy Corrigan . Societe Generale launched an innovative issue of 400 'down-and-out ' call warrants on Vnesheconombank 's US dollar-denominated syndicated loans . The warrants expire if the value of the loans falls below a pre-determined level on or before the exercise date of July 22 1994 , which is also the expiry date . Salomon Bros issued 1,200 call warrants on a basket of emerging market debt comprising Republic of Argentina collateralised fixed-rate bonds due 2023 , Republic of Brazil IDU bonds due 2001 , Republic of Nigeria par bonds due 2020 and Republic of Venezuela collateralised fixed-rate bonds due 2020 .
