for the past eight months the automatic driverless trains of londons docklands light railway have been shuttling along a new fivemile extension to the suburb of beckton the trains have been operating without passengers as software and signalling systems controlling the railway have been tested problems in constructing the beckton extension and installing the systems have delayed the opening for 18 months mr malcolm hutchinson dlr managing director is determined to avoid the breakdowns and delays which followed the opening of the first 7 12 miles of the railway in 1987 it is important that the dlr gets this launch right it has never really recovered from the poor reputation it acquired in its early years this was partly because it was designed when docklands was still planned as an area of housing and light industry and before the building of canary wharf turned it into a highrise office centre the beckton extension will bring a large part of east london within easy reach of the line and take the railway within a few hundred yards of the city airport in a hangover from the poor transport planning which has bedevilled docklands development there will still be no station in the airport terminal the beckton extension which starts east from poplar is only one of several developments under way mr hutchinson and his team of managers recruited in november 1991 from the procurement department of the ministry of defence believe they will bring about a rehabilitation of the railways image and a period of rapid expansion the second significant improvement should come in the summer when painstaking work to modernise signalling will be completed and the railway will be open in the evenings and at weekends making it much more attractive to local workers and accessible for tourists original signalling is being replaced with a system incorporating improved safety systems and allowing greater flexibility in train timetables by the end of this year the dlr expects to choose a private consortium to carry out a pounds 100m extension of the railway across the thames this will take it south into greenwich and lewisham more than doubling potential revenues and traffic volumes at present the dlr costs pounds 20m a year to run but takes only pounds 4m in ticket revenues once the line is completed the dlr is expected to lease it from the consortium for between 15 and 20 years before assuming final ownership original plans were for five new stations south of the river and for the present island gardens terminus on the north bank to be moved underground but this would have pushed up costs to nearly pounds 150m and made the project uneconomic so the present plan to resite island gardens below ground will be dropped and proposals to build the cutty sark station in greenwich town centre will be shelved although this decision has prompted criticism that the line would then bypass the most attractive location for travellers hopes of a sustained recovery of the uk economy and indications that the canary wharf development is starting to attract more tenants make improvements to the dlr particularly timely the lewisham spur is due to be completed by 1997 the year before the pounds 19bn jubilee line extension provides a direct underground link between docklands and the west end of london the jubilee line extension will increase the attractions of docklands for office developers but will at the same time steal many of the dlrs customers who now come out from the city an interchange station between the two lines will be built at canary wharf the lewisham line it is hoped will provide a new source of income and narrow the gap between operating costs and ticket revenues but by the time this happens the dlr could well be in preparation for private ownership
