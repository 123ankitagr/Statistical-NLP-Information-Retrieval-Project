MR Percival Patterson , a 57-year-old , London-trained lawyer , will be sworn in today as prime minister of Jamaica , succeeding Mr Michael Manley , who retired on Saturday because of ill health . Mr Manley 's retirement took effect soon after the ruling People 's National party elected Mr Patterson as its president , giving him a margin of four votes to every one in support of the only other contender , Miss Portia Simpson , the labour and welfare minister . Miss Simpson had support in the rural and inner-city areas , with Mr Patterson being backed by the parliamentary party and the island 's business community . After his victory became clear , Miss Simpson claimed there had been irregularities in the voting , but said she would respect the result 'in the interest of the party and the country ' . In accepting his election to the presidency of the PNP , Mr Patterson invited supporters of both factions to unite under his leadership . The impact of the row on the unity of the government will be reflected in the composition of the cabinet Mr Patterson names this week . Mr Hugh Small , finance minister , who supported Miss Simpson 's candidature , said he doubted he would be appointed .
