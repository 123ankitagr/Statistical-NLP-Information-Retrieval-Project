the santa monica rent control board last week rescinded a rule that automatically allowed rent increases if the board failed to act on a landlords rent increase petition within 120 days of filing board member wayne bauer said that the rule which was adopted a decade ago when rent control was adopted was too drastic and that it created undue stress on staff and the board to process petitions quickly rent board administrator mary ann yurkonis who said the deadline was missed only once or twice in the last 10 years said the deadline also forced the board to often deny continuances for tenants who needed more time to present their cases landlords have criticized the decision saying it will allow the board to drag out processing petitions
