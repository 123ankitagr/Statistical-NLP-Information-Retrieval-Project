The Santa Monica Rent Control Board last week rescinded a rule that automatically allowed rent increases if the board failed to act on a landlord 's rent increase petition within 120 days of filing . Board member Wayne Bauer said that the rule -- which was adopted a decade ago when rent control was adopted -- was too drastic , and that it created undue stress on staff and the board to process petitions quickly . Rent board administrator Mary Ann Yurkonis , who said the deadline was missed only once or twice in the last 10 years , said the deadline also forced the board to often deny continuances for tenants who needed more time to present their cases . Landlords have criticized the decision , saying it will allow the board to drag out processing petitions .
