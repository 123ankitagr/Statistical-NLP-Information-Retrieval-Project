Country singer Willie Nelson wo n't have to put his land on the auction block this month , but the IRS has n't forgotten about him . A Dec. 27 auction at the Travis County Courthouse wo n't take place as advertised , Internal Revenue Service spokeswoman Jamie Stewart said Tuesday . The IRS last month seized Nelson 's properties in several states to ensure payment of $ 16.7 million in taxes it says the Grammy award-winning singer owes . Nelson says his tax problems were caused by poor handling of his finances by a previous business manager . Officials are continuing to compile a list of Nelson 's holdings , Stewart said . Once that accounting is completed , probably around the first of the year , an auction or auctions can be set for all his property . Fund-raising efforts have been undertaken for Nelson and donations have been received from several states , organizers say .
