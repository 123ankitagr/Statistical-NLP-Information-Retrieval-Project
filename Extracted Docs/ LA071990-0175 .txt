policy record much criticism of nixon reagan said was based on nothing at all but henry a kissinger nixons secretary of state at the time of his resignation disputed that statement wednesday saying that while his former boss deserves enormous credit for his administrations foreign policy successes nixon and his staff also blundered badly in handling the watergate scandal i think there were definite huge errors kissinger said during a 40minute interview at a beverly hills hotel i have always believed that he was punished much too severely but i think there were huge mistakes made with some scholars questioning the nixon librarys value as a research institution kissinger also called on the former president to compile a complete set of presidential papers and administer them according to national archives access policies nixon library executive director hugh hewitt had said that certain people would likely be excluded from the library a statement he later retracted and kissinger suggested that nixon issue a statement announcing his intention to have the library administered identically to other presidential libraries while the museum with its exhibits on nixons career opens friday the library portion of more interest to scholars is not expected to open until next year hewitt said the watergate exhibits in the museum still were not ready and might not be finished friday the postal service set up a booth outside the building for a special library postmark across the street facing the building was a handlettered sign watch out george hes tan rested and ready nixon 1992 hours before the nixons visited the library simon who served as treasury secretary under nixon and one of the main moneyraisers for the facility hosted a luncheon at the building for

help resume the library project described his first tour of the facility wednesday as breathtaking i didnt see anybody who was with nixon in the white house who didnt come out without tears in his

included american political leaders reaching back nearly half a century they say vice president dan quayle is young nixon was 39 when he was vice president khachigian noted there are people here who
