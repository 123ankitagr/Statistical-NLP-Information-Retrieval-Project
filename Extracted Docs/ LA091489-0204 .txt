Los Angeles County health officials said Wednesday that last month 's hospitalization of a Lancaster-area man with St. Louis encephalitis was the first confirmed human case of the illness in the county in three years . The 65-year-old man has since been released from a hospital , said Toby Staheli , spokeswoman for the county Department of Health Services . Officials also reported Wednesday that mosquitoes carrying the disease have been caught in traps in the City of Industry and Whittier . Abatement programs are under way in those areas , she said . Staheli said the ill man told officials that he had not traveled outside the Lancaster area before becoming sick , but no mosquitoes carrying the disease have been caught in that area . The disease , which causes inflammation of the brain and spinal cord , is usually mild in humans . Symptoms usually include fever , severe headache and nausea . In rare cases , it causes confusion , tremors , paralysis , coma and death . Health officials in May detected the virus in pigeons in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area in Encino . Between 1983 and 1986 , 21 people living in the county became ill and one person died of the disease , officials said . In humans , the disease is caused by bites from infected mosquitoes . Officials urged residents to eliminate stagnant water that might be mosquito-breeding areas .
