Conditions Set for Spielberg : Venezuela has granted Steven Spielberg the rights to film in a fragile ecosystem but set conditions that Venezuelan officials say the Hollywood producer may not accept . Spielberg is trying to win the rights to film 30 days worth of scenes in a projected Walt Disney film entitled `` Aracniphobia '' in the restricted and fragile Gran Sabana area of southern Venezuela . It is home to dozens of plant and animal species that occur nowhere else on the planet , said environment ministry spokesman Luis Gonzalez . Although approving the film shoot , environment ministry officials set the following conditions : Certain scenes must be filmed from the air only ; only a limited amount of personnel and equipment will be allowed into the area ; overnight stays in the area are prohibited , and the film company must hand over an audio-visual record of their activities to the environment ministry . No date has been set for the projected shoot , and `` so far there is no word whether the film company will accept the restrictions , '' Gonzalez said . SHAUNA SNOW
