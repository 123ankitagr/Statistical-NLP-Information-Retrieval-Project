sir around easter 1991 i received an unexpected and welcome piece of news it came from the liquidator of baku consolidated oilfields ltd it transpired my grandfather had been a shareholder in this company which had lost all its assets in the 1917 russian revolution now that the soviet union had made amends and paid compensation we could anticipate around christmas a distribution to original contributories or their heirs on christmas eve i received a further letter from the liquidator informing me that the inland revenue proposed to skim off 35 per cent of our money by way of corporation tax after 74 years of zero return our payment is to be further delayed and substantially reduced i wonder on what proper grounds of equity and tax law this mean-minded side-swipe could be based is this policy being adopted by the government in all similar compensation cases john noble ardkinglas estate cairndow argyll pa26 8 bh
