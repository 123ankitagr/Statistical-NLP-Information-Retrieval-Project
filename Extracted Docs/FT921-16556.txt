Sir , around Easter 1991 I received an unexpected and welcome piece of news . It came from the liquidator of Baku Consolidated Oilfields Ltd . It transpired my grandfather had been a shareholder in this company , which had lost all its assets in the 1917 Russian revolution . Now that the Soviet Union had made amends and paid compensation , we could anticipate around Christmas a distribution to original contributories or their heirs . On Christmas Eve I received a further letter from the liquidator , informing me that the Inland Revenue proposed to skim off 35 per cent of our money by way of 'corporation tax ' . After 74 years of zero return , our payment is to be further delayed and substantially reduced . I wonder on what proper grounds of equity and tax law this mean-minded side-swipe could be based ? Is this policy being adopted by the government in all similar compensation cases ? John Noble , Ardkinglas Estate , Cairndow , Argyll PA26 8BH
