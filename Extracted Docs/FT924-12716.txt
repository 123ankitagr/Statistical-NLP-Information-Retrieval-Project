frances three car makers peugeot citroen and stateowned renault have made big strides in productivity as they prepare to face the japanese challenge in a liberalised european community market they have done so in the nick of time for frances bilateral import quota on japanese cars which has limited their penetration to around 3 per cent of the domestic market for years is due to go by the end of this year already the japanese share of the french car market has been allowed to creep up in anticipation from 33 per cent of new registrations in 1990 to 41 per cent last year according to the comite des constructeurs francais dautomobiles by 1998 japanese imports to france could rise from last years 82440 vehicles to around 317000 or 111 per cent of the market according to the european commission the french government appears resigned to opening the floodgates made inevitable by the 1990 ecjapan car import agreement under which the community market is to be fully liberalised over a sevenyear transition period to the end of 1999 mr jacques calvet the chairman of peugeot has condemned the deal as an example of how europe has unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange yet despite mr calvets complaints incidentally not echoed by his counterparts at renault the government is preparing for a controlled arrival of japanese competition one sign of this is its readiness to allow nissan to buy out its french dealership earlier this year ending 10 years of resistance to the deal other japanese producers are on the move fuji heavy industries was planning to export legacy saloons and estate cars to france at the end of september and expects authorisation soon to import subaru cars subaru france hopes to sell 1000 fuji cars in the year to march 1993 from 25 new outlets in june suzuki made its first french export sales though on a very small scale while daihatsu is studying the possibility of exporting its charade models to france only 10 years ago it was unthinkable that peugeot and renault could face japanese competition headon they were both on the brink of bankruptcy at the time today they have come through the recession leaner and more efficient and made big improvements in quality last year for example the peugeot group which includes citroen maintains it produced the highest net margins of any car maker in the world even after having suffered a 40 per cent decline in net earnings renault reported well over doubled net profits last year followed by a fivefold rise in earnings in the first half of 1992 and is proceeding so successfully with its alliance with volvo that both partners talk of a possible merger their payroll costs have fallen dramatically renault has cut its workforce by 25 per cent over the past five years while peugeot less overmannned than its public sector rival has managed a 5 per cent reduction over the same period the two groups have also successfully introduced just in time stock control japanese style production teams in place of the old line management system reorganised their design departments and modernised most of their product ranges peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per cent over the past five years while renault says it has improved its productivity by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per year over the same period both aim at least to repeat that improvement by the end of the decade tighter stock control has saved financial charges for both of them yet the extent to which just in time stock control depends on japanese style labour stability was sharply underlined by a strike at renaults main engine and gearbox plant last year which took only 10 days to halt the groups entire french and belgian car production starved of vital components the progress has come in the following main areas where the french industry has not hesitated to adapt techniques from the japanese competition quality control peugeot has abandoned the old style of quality control whereby faults are identified and corrected in an enormous car park at the end of the production line now the lines are divided into sections each managed by an autonomous team responsible for correcting its own faults as the vehicle moves through as a result peugeot has over the past five years closed all its refinishing shops renault is moving over to the same system and aims to close all its refinishing departments within four years components renault and peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming primarily designers and assemblers this is another way of cutting costs to the bone but also reflects the fact that neither wants to get involved in the increasing electronic and specialised components found in modern cars as a result the proportion of boughtin components has risen steeply in recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at peugeot and 67 per cent at renault at the same time they have set rigorous quality controls on suppliers peugeot and renault have for the past five years been running joint audits on component suppliers quality and are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers productivity and costs renault has also achieved substantial cost savings by pooling much of its component buying activities with volvo design management another part of the race to catch up with japan is the time and investment needed to design and launch new cars here peugeot estimates that the japanese still have a substantial advantage capable of launching a new model for around ffr34bn in three years as against the french average of ffr6bn to ffr8bn in four to five years these comparisons are of course rough since there is no standard measure for the starting point of a new design the time taken to design and launch renaults latest small car the twingo was in line with japanese experience says mr philippe gras deputy chief executive on average renault aims to produce a new model in just under four years down from the nearly five years that used to be the norm peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results from 1994 even so renault and peugeot have some way to go before they can meet japanese standards of productivity the result of all these efforts is to bring the french car industrys productivity to just 10 per cent behind that of japanese car producers in britain itself 10 per cent behind the japanese in japan according to a study by consultants mckinsey for the european commission
