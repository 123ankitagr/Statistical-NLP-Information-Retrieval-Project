Prosecutors intend to seek additional drug charges against Mayor Marion Barry , sources familiar with the investigation said Monday . Also , prosecutors said in court papers filed Monday that hair samples taken from Barry the night of his drug arrest show he had `` used cocaine repeatedly '' in the preceding weeks . The sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said U.S. Attorney Jay B. Stephens wants a federal grand jury to return up to five more misdemeanor drug possession charges against Barry . Barry already faces five misdemeanor cocaine possession charges and three felony counts of lying to a federal grand jury about his drug use . He has pleaded innocent to all eight counts .
