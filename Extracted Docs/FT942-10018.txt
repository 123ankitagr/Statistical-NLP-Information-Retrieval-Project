Japan 's fire and marine insurance groups , faced with higher insurance payments due to an increase in typhoon damages , are likely to raise fire insurance premiums this year . It will be the first increase in this sector since 1948 . The Fire and Marine Insurance Rating Association of Japan , an insurance industry group , has applied for finance ministry approval to raise fire insurance premiums by an average 7.74 per cent for houses and 5.86 per cent for offices . After the spate of typhoons in 1991 , insurance payments rose three-fold to Y650bn ( Dollars 6.3bn ) .
