Syria said yesterday it was not in a hurry to make peace with Israel if peace did not mean Israel returning all occupied Arab territory , Reuter reports from Damascus . 'Syria believes time is on the Arabs ' side so we need not hurry for a settlement which will not restore the Arabs ' usurped rights , ' the ruling party newspaper al-Baath said . 'Here we should cite a quotation from the Arab leader ( Syrian President ) Hafez al-Assad in which he said future generations would be able to restore the Arabs ' rights if our generation could not , ' added the newspaper . But al-Baath said this did not mean Syria would abandon the Middle East peace process . Syria and Israel have held direct peace talks for almost two years without achieving tangible progress . Syria wants Israel to give back the Golan Heights . Israel says it is willing to withdraw from at least a part of the Golan but first it wants to know what kind of peace Syria envisages .
