the issue of north koreas suspected nuclear weapons programme which appeared to be approaching a resolution a few months ago has become contentious again following pyongyangs announcement yesterday that it is withdrawing from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty north korea is believed to have started its nuclear research project in the mid1960s as part of the juche selfreliance ideology of president kim ilsung to create an independent defence capability the north korean leader worried that he could no longer rely on soviet military backing after the fiasco of the 1962 cuban missile crisis if a second korean war broke out it was similar concerns about us military commitment to south korea in the 1970s that persuaded seoul to try to develop a nuclear weapon although the programme was eventually abandoned under us pressure mr tai sung an a respected usbased analyst of north korea argues that the country is seeking several objectives in its nuclear weapons programme they include improving its negotiating leverage with south korea and its allies the us and japan and offsetting its looming loss of conventional military superiority relative to south korea by building a nuclear strategic equaliser mr kim ilsung has developed a paranoid fear of nuclear attack from the us ever since that option was discussed during the korean war 40 year ago he says the main goal of the north korean nuclear programme is to deter nuclear attack from the united states by developing a local balance of nuclear terror on the korean peninsula as north korea became increasingly isolated from its russian and chinese allies in the postcold war period it has expanded its facilities at the yongbyon nuclear complex 60 miles from pyongyang in an apparently accelerated effort to acquire a nuclear weapon it operates two small reactors at the site and is building a bigger 50megawatt unit it is also constructing what appears to be a large nuclear fuel reprocessing plant to extract weaponsgrade plutonium from the spent nuclear fuel generated from the reactors however there were also indications that pyongyang realised its nuclear weapons programme was proving counterproductive as its economy deteriorated its need for foreign investment from south korea the us and japan to revive the economy led it to make apparent concessions on the nuclear issue to reduce suspicions blocking ties with these countries it signed a nonnuclear pact with south korea in late 1991 and agreed to allow scheduled inspections by the international atomic energy agency last spring in belated compliance with its signing of the treaty in 1985 but progress became bogged down after seoul wanted to conduct challenge inspections of suspected but undisclosed nuclear facilities while the iaea demanded last month a special inspection of two buildings in the yongbyon complex that it believed contained plutonium the iaea request pushed pyongyang towards renouncing the treaty the obvious conclusion to draw from pyongyangs action is that it has accumulated plutonium and feared that the iaea would discover it the us and japanese governments claim that north korea has already stockpiled enough plutonium to make at least one or two nuclear bombs japanese officials estimate that north korea has extracted between 16kg and 24kg of weaponsgrade plutonium but there are other explanations for north koreas apparently rash response one is that the nuclear programme has become a key issue in power struggle between hardliners and reformers in pyongyang while the reformers were in the ascendant last year and successfully pushed for nuclear concessions in return for foreign investment the hardliners might be gaining power now there has also been speculation recently that kim ilsung is seriously ill which might have triggered a political fight another explanation is that officials fear public discontent as the economy collapses and are creating a crisis atmosphere about a us threat in the form of the current team spirit military exercise to rally support behind the regime pyongyangs growing isolation from the outside world may be strengthening its resolve to resist what it perceives as intrusions on its sovereignty which it accused the iaea of doing with its inspection demands russian and chinese diplomats recently cited this reason in warning that the west should not press north korea too much on the nuclear issue and deny it room for diplomatic manoeuvring and the ability to save face
