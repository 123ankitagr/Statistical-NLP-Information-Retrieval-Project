the way rudy suwara sees things every team still alive in the ncaa women's volleyball playoffs is 1-0 that's one of the reasons suwara believes his san diego state team can upset stanford at 8 30 tonight in a west region semifinal at ucla's john wooden center sdsu 24-11 is the sixth-seeded team in the region stanford 26-3 is seeded second top-seeded ucla 32-1 plays no 4 new mexico 22-6 in the other semifinal at 6 30 p m the winners play saturday at 7 30 p m stanford's real good but in this tournament they're 1-0 just like us suwara said sdsu became 1-0 by upsetting third-seeded brigham young 3-1 last friday at byu in the first round stanford whose only losses this year were to ucla twice and pacific advanced easily over no 7 wyoming 3-0 sdsu has not played the cardinal this season but leads the series 10-6 one thing in our favor is we've got one of the best-serving teams in the nation suwara said we have gracie schutt who some people think is the hardest server that's ever been in women's volleyball on the college level we've got sandy thompson who also hits a hard spinning serve we've got angela martin and kim lester who hit really tough flip serves we think our serving hopefully will rattle stanford and throw their passing off if we can throw their passing off we can play with anybody that was our game plan against byu and that's our game plan against stanford jim lindgren
