the way rudy suwara sees things every team still alive in the ncaa womens volleyball playoffs is 10 thats one of the reasons suwara believes his san diego state team can upset stanford at 830 tonight in a west region semifinal at uclas john wooden center sdsu 2411 is the sixthseeded team in the region stanford 263 is seeded second topseeded ucla 321 plays no 4 new mexico 226 in the other semifinal at 630 pm the winners play saturday at 730 pm stanfords real good but in this tournament theyre 10 just like us suwara said sdsu became 10 by upsetting thirdseeded brigham young 31 last friday at byu in the first round stanford whose only losses this year were to ucla twice and pacific advanced easily over no 7 wyoming 30 sdsu has not played the cardinal this season but leads the series 106 one thing in our favor is weve got one of the bestserving teams in the nation suwara said we have gracie schutt who some people think is the hardest server thats ever been in womens volleyball on the college level weve got sandy thompson who also hits a hard spinning serve weve got angela martin and kim lester who hit really tough flip serves we think our serving hopefully will rattle stanford and throw their passing off if we can throw their passing off we can play with anybody that was our game plan against byu and thats our game plan against stanford jim lindgren
