Quarterback Steve Stenstrom passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns in the first half to lead El Toro High School to a 41-21 South Coast League victory over Dana Hills Friday at Mission Viejo High School . Stenstrom completed 11 of 15 passes in the first half , including a 57-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Watkins with 54 seconds left to give El Toro ( 7-0 , 2-0 ) a 28-0 halftime lead . El Toro Coach Bob Johnson removed Stenstrom early in the third quarter after the Chargers made it 34-0 lead on Jerome Oakman 's 1-yard run . Stenstrom finished with 13 completions in 18 attempts for 277 yards . He was intercepted once . `` I 've said all along ( that ) Steve 's the best quarterback in Orange County , and he shows it every week , '' Johnson said . `` He gets better each game . '' Dana Hills ( 5-2 , 0-2 ) tried to slow El Toro 's passing game by double-covering receiver Rob Johnson , Stenstrom 's favorite target . That strategy left Rowe with single coverage , which he beat for five receptions totaling 107 yards . `` Kevin 's a great receiver , '' Stenstrom said . `` When teams double-team Rob , Kevin makes me look good because he always gets open . '' El Toro finished with 461 yards in total offense , including 101 rushing yards in the second half . Dana Hills quarterback Grant Taylor connected with Chris Morgan on a pair of 24-yard touchdown passes in the second half . Taylor , who had only 14 yards passing at halftime , finished with 265 yards on 15-of-20 passing with one interception .
