Sir , May I draw your attention to another problem with the newly-introduced airport tax ( 'Airlines hit at levy on departures ' , October 31 ) . In addition to the confusion over European rates there is the problem of double levying where passengers wish to make use of the fact that London has five airports . Rates for London-Geneva-London are Pounds 5 when travelling in and out of the same airport , but Pounds 10 when flying from Heathrow and returning to Gatwick , or any other combination . Where is the logic in this ? Duncan J McKay , 82 Sedgwick Street , Cambridge CB1 3AL
