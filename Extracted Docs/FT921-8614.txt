PUTTING your money into a savings account with a bank or building society is no longer the straightforward activity it once was . As a growing number of savers have discovered in the last year , banks and building societies commonly discontinue a well-established savings account and replace it with a similar one offering better terms to attract new customers . Savers who do not monitor carefully what their building society is doing may be stranded in an account which earns less interest than they have a right to expect . Building societies offer several excuses for doing this kind of thing . One is that in the age of retail financial markets , savers ought to shop around constantly for the best bargain as they do when buying cornflakes or shoes . Another is that savings institutions are forced into this sort of ploy because consumers are already too astute and the savings business is less profitable than it used to be . The real reason seems to be that computer technology has made it easy to close off existing customers and old accounts , and thereby pay the better interest rate only to a smaller group of new customers . A recent ruling by the Building Societies Ombudsman accepts that societies should take reasonable steps to inform customers of new accounts by advertising in the press and publicity in their branches . Rather weakly , the Ombudsman stopped short of insisting that building societies should actually tell customers directly when a better account is available . Yet when TSB Bank opened a new savings account recently , it wrote to all holders of similar old accounts , telling them they would be transferred to the new one . One society , National & Provincial , has promised to tell its customers what the best account is for them . Quite right too . Savers are not only the customers of building societies : they are also their owners . When an industry treats its owners this way , it is a sign that something is going seriously wrong .
