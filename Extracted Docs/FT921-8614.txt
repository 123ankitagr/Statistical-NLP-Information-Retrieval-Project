putting your money into a savings account with a bank or building society is no longer the straightforward activity it once was as a growing number of savers have discovered in the last year banks and building societies commonly discontinue a well-established savings account and replace it with a similar one offering better terms to attract new customers savers who do not monitor carefully what their building society is doing may be stranded in an account which earns less interest than they have a right to expect building societies offer several excuses for doing this kind of thing one is that in the age of retail financial markets savers ought to shop around constantly for the best bargain as they do when buying cornflakes or shoes another is that savings institutions are forced into this sort of ploy because consumers are already too astute and the savings business is less profitable than it used to be the real reason seems to be that computer technology has made it easy to close off existing customers and old accounts and thereby pay the better interest rate only to a smaller group of new customers a recent ruling by the building societies ombudsman accepts that societies should take reasonable steps to inform customers of new accounts by advertising in the press and publicity in their branches rather weakly the ombudsman stopped short of insisting that building societies should actually tell customers directly when a better account is available yet when tsb bank opened a new savings account recently it wrote to all holders of similar old accounts telling them they would be transferred to the new one one society national provincial has promised to tell its customers what the best account is for them quite right too savers are not only the customers of building societies they are also their owners when an industry treats its owners this way it is a sign that something is going seriously wrong
