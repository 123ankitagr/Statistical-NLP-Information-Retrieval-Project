After almost 40 years , the long- awaited memorials are finally being erected and dedicated to and for both the living and dead veterans of the Korean `` Conflict . '' For the purposes of a book , I would appreciate hearing from readers who served in that war ( June , 1950-July , 1953 ) . I am interested in what kinds of welcomes awaited the returning veterans when they set foot on U.S. soil again . What did their loved ones , their families , friends or local citizens say to them ? How were they received back into their communities ? What kind of obstacles confronted them as newly returned veterans from such a distant and relatively unpopular war ?
