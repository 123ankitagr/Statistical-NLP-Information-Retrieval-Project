Art Cook , who has served as interim city manager since the Aug. 31 resignation of James Evans , has been appointed to the post permanently , Mayor Lois Shade has announced . Cook was chosen last week from among 56 applicants who responded to a nationwide search for a successor to Evans , City Clerk Culver Heaton said . Applications were screened by a committee of three area city managers , and the City Council interviewed four applicants from among those rated highly by the committee , Heaton said . However , Cook 's appointment was not unanimous . Councilman David S. Bodley said he and Shade voted for the hiring of another applicant , whom he refused to name . `` I believe there were other individuals whom we interviewed who had better qualifications for the position than Mr. Cook , and that 's why I cast my vote for another applicant , '' Bodley said . `` But both Lois and I have made it clear that we are going to work with the new city manager . It is our intent to provide support on the council . '' Cook is a career Glendora city employee , beginning as an engineering aide in 1956 . He became the city 's director of public works in 1969 , holding that position until he replaced Evans as city manager .
