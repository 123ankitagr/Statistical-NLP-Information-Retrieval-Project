Terry Costa was enjoying the quiet as he sat down to type a letter to his 80-year-old mother this morning , encouraging her to slow down and take care of herself . She had n't been feeling well lately . It was 9 a.m. at the Santa Ana Restaurant Equipment Co. , at 2520 S. Fairview Ave. , Santa Ana , which Costa owns . The 45-year-old businessman began pecking away at the electric typewriter keys , not knowing how long the lull in activity would last and wanting to write the note to his mother , who lives in Kent , Wash. '' I just sat down and I heard this screech outside my window , '' said Costa . `` I really did not think too much about it because we hear them all the time out on the street . '' But what Costa saw next made him think quickly . A truck sliding on its side came through the plate-glass window where Costa was sitting . `` I saw the headlights and the front of the truck , and I knew it was not going to stop . It looked strange moving on its side . I wanted to get away from the flying glass , so I got up and I tripped over a box as I ran away . I fell on the floor , and the truck crashed through the window , '' Costa recalled in a nervous voice . The pickup stopped only a few feet from where Costa was working . The desk and chair where he had sat were covered with glass and debris . Costa was not injured . It was not the first time this sort of thing had happened to the Santa Ana Restaurant Equipment Co. Before it moved to its new location on Fairview , an intoxicated motorist had driven his car into the front of the building at the old location . No one was inside when that happened , Costa said . According to Costa and other witnesses , the pickup truck and a passenger car collided on Fairview and the truck was knocked on its side . The drivers of the pickup truck and car were not injured , but a passenger in the truck was taken to a nearby hospital , witnesses said .
