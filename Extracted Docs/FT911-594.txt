japanese investors who have in the past decade transformed world markets in securities property and art are steadily being set free to invest in commodities the japanese authorities are gradually lowering the regulatory barriers which have for a long time restricted japanese investment in commodity markets to a trickle the japanese parliament last month passed a new commodities regulation law which for the first time sets out rules for the sale and management of commodity futures funds in japan the growth in commodities fund investment from a very small base may be explosive the ministry of international trade and industry or miti which sponsored the new law expects the accumulated total of japanese funds to increase fivefold in the next two or three years from the current total of slightly less than y200bn dollars 14bn if interest rates around the world decline improving conditions for commodity investment the funds will grow even faster than that says mr koichi akaishi of mitis commercial affairs office mr akaishi says that the traditional japanese view that commodity markets are too risky for sensible investors is giving way to a more rational assessment of the balance of risk and return people are learning to accept risk mr akaishi points out some commodity fund managers are more cautious warning that high interest rates could dampen investment more effectively than miti expects they point out that the new commodity law will remain more restrictive than anything in force in the uk or the us important regulatory issues have still to be decided by the three warring ministries with powers over commodities investment miti the ministry of finance and the ministry of agriculture japans giant trading companies including mitsubishi and mitsui are leading the way in marketing funds as are large nonbank finance groups including orix japans largest leasing company and sumisho lease a leasing company affiliated to sumitomo another big trading concern among others joining the fray are trust banks and securities companies which have the great advantage of national branch networks already in place and selling financial products a commodity fund association was established last month with 30 members foreign companies may have little chance marketing products in direct competition with these powerful japanese groups there is however considerable scope for foreign investment advisors to manage funds collected by a japanese partner not least because japanese companies themselves have little experience of commodities fund management the funds will be invested mostly in instruments traded on us and european exchanges since japanese commodity exchanges suffer from relatively low volumes and high costs already the leading japanese fund marketing companies have reached agreements with foreign managers mitsubishi with baldwin a us commodities boutique mitsui with with ed f man the ukbased commodities group and sumisho lease with rudolf wolff another ukbased concern orix is operating in partnership with commodities corporation a us company in which it bought a 30 per cent stake in 1989 since few of these agreements are likely to be exclusive other foreign companies are hoping to strike similar fund management deals these companies include merrill lynch shearson lehman and salomon brothers all us investment banks and cargill the giant us commodities trader miti says that it expects to licence about 4050 sales companies and about ten investment advisors investors salesmen and managers alike will need to keep a wary eye on three ministries overseeing commodities which have been involved in a prolonged turf battle over the new industry miti has long supported the development of commodity funds in response from trading companies and others wanting to develop the market the ministry of finance dragged its feet it was partly concerned about investor protection and also wanted to make sure that financial companies had a chance to compete the agriculture ministry feared losing its traditional rights over farm products the first japanese company to launch a commodity fund was mitsubishi in 1988 with an offshore vehicle sold by its london finance subsidiary to japanese institutions the following year funds worth y438bn were sold and even more was expected for 1990 the scale of the offerings worried the finance ministry officials decided that commodity futures were not commodities at all but financial instruments so they insisted that only financial companies chiefly securities companies should be allowed to sell them in the first half of 1990 funds worth only y102bn were launched as the finance ministry and miti slugged it out the new law forms part of an agreement reached late last year by the ministries under pressure from the finance ministry the minimum investment unit will be y100m thus putting commodity funds out of reach of most private investors a ban on sales of funds to individuals is being dropped at least 50 per cent of the fund has to be invested in commodity futures no more than 30 per cent can be invested in cash and bonds and nothing in equities that is to avoid treading on the toes of securities companies which monopolise the market in equity investment funds the most important undecided issue is whether commodity futures funds will be permitted to invest in financial futures fund managers say that this is normal practice overseas since price movements in commodity and financial markets are interrelated miti supports the granting of permission the finance ministry has declined to make a decision all the funds so far authorised by miti are closedend fixedterm funds running for four to seven years the managers are required to put 70 per cent of the funds collected in a safe interestbearing investment to ensure investors get their original capital back the remaining 30 per cent is invested in commodities miti would like to see investment in japans commodity exchanges including the tokyo commodity exchange
