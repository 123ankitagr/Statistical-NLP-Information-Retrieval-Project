for the first time in decades indian hoteliers were pleasantly surprised to see room occupancies soar in the summer in spite of inhospitable temperatures writes shiraz sidhva hotels in the main metropolitan centres have traditionally suffered room gluts between april and august this year they were so full that they withdrew the usual off-season discounts and had to turn away some of their regular clients it's now virtually impossible to get a hotel room at short notice says mr prateek chawla director outbound travels delhi-based travel agent and tour operators for the business traveller there is no off-season the indian hospitality industry is reaping the benefits of the government's liberalisation programme which has made india one of asia's most attractive emerging markets the top hotel chains the taj group itc hotels and the oberoi group will invest nearly rs30bn in new projects over the next five years concentrating for the first time on building budget hotels rather than five-star ones the current total of 52,000 rooms in fewer than 900 government-approved hotels across the country is woefully inadequate to cater to an estimated 5 m tourist arrivals by 1997 double last year's figure of 2.2 m the government has therefore cleared 524 hotel projects till march this year or 28,000 additional rooms industry watchers doubt that all the proposed investment will materialise but the tourism ministry has set an ambitious target to build 125,000 rooms by the year 2000 several international hotel chains are tying up with indian partners taking advantage of the fact that the government now allows foreigners up to 51 per cent equity in the hotel industry the us chain holiday inns worldwide has tied up with inn realty owned by a group of non-resident indians to open holiday inns in the himalayan mountain resorts of nainital and manali and four-star hotels in nine indian towns the chain will spend more than rs500m on its plan to build 70 hotels

manage at least 12 projects including three-star inns india has never built for tomorrow always yesterday says mr rabindra seth of itc hotels who has been part of the industry for over 30 years he points out that there are more hotel rooms in cities like singapore hong kong bangkok london and toronto than there are in the whole of india for all its size and wealth of tourist attractions in new delhi the capital no new hotel has been built since 1982, when more than a dozen hotels were hurriedly constructed for the asian games creating a glut for years if we are to cater to 5.5 m tourists and business travellers by the turn of the century then we need at least twice as many rooms as we are offering now the unavailability and cost of land particularly in the big cities has deterred new investors socialist governments in the past regarded luxury hotels as necessary evils and levied prohibitive taxes on them making hotels less viable than they could have been while expenditure tax has been halved to 10 per cent land continues to be a major deterrent the current boom has spawned a whole new breed of first-time hoteliers many of whom are land developers builders and contractors entrepreneurs such as shaw wallace the large liquor group and mahindra and mahindra the bombay-based heavy engineering tractor and automobile manufacturers have diversified into hotels thanks to their ability to withstand the long gestation periods associated with this business one of the main stumbling blocks in the hotel industry is the acquisition of land says mr seth builders are best equipped to tackle that part of the problem and will often allow professional hotel companies to run the hotels for them foreign investors are also joining non-resident indians nris allowed to buy land mr dadi balsara a singapore-based nri businessman has recently announced a joint venture with howard johnson franchise systems of the us to build 10 three-star hotels with plans to build acquire and franchise
