angel busybody devon white had one of those rare nights when he didnt know whether to cherish or forget his contributions to a 43 victory over the kansas city royals at anaheim stadium saturday on the cherish side were whites three hits two singles and a double which helped push his average up to 299 he scored once he flustered royal starter charlie leibrandt into heaving a pickoff throw into foul territory he stole a base his 21st in a young season all in all a perfectly wonderful evening until you recount whites pair of midgame adventures for starters he was caught stealing after one of those singles later white tried snaring a sinking line drive off the grass blades he missed and two royal runs scored to tie the game so what to do applaud or sadly shake your head probably applaud the angels did without white they wouldnt have had at least one of those four runs the circumstances white singled between third and shortstop to begin the third inning with 20 stolen bases already to whites credit leibrandt was obliged to keep an eye on him at first so he did lobbing ball after ball to first baseman pat tabler all in hopes of keeping white put it nearly worked white had cut his lead down slightly when leibrandt unleashed another throw in the general direction of tabler but this time tabler was shielded by white and the ball whizzed past his glove and into foul territory meanwhile white motored all the way to third base and later scored easily on wally joyners single white was back at first in the fourth inning too courtesy of another ground ball single that scooted past shortstop kurt stillwell this time he took his lead and was off as leibrandt apparently began his motion toward home but wait leibrandt instead threw to tabler at first who threw to second in time to catch a surprised white its a balk white said of leibrandts move i still think its a balk his motion was going toward the plate if it was none of the four umpires objected in the scorebook whites attempt simply went down as a caught stealing with two outs in the sixth white was again the center of attention with kevin seitzer on second and the fleetfooted bo jackson on first tabler hit a line drive toward midcenter field white charged i went after that ball because i thought we could get out of the inning he said i thought i had it but then the ball really dipped a possible out suddenly became a surefire double as the ball bounced in front of white and then off his glove toward right field dante bichette retrieved the ball and threw toward home but not in time to get jackson i knew jackson was going no doubt bichette said the throw made it as far as wally joyner who then relayed it to catcher lance parrish too late a regular human being wouldnt have scored white said in admiration of jacksons speed then again said bichette a regular human being wouldnt have come close to tablers line drive in the first place if anybody could have caught it devo could have he said
