A diplomatic row between Malaysia and Australia over remarks by Mr Paul Keating , Australia 's prime minister , about Dr Mahathir Mohamad , his Malaysian counterpart , intensified over the weekend , Kieran Cooke reports . Mr Abdullah Ahmad Badawi , Malaysia 's foreign minister , said a letter sent by Mr Keating attempting to explain his remarks had not helped ease tensions . 'The letter . . . was not a letter coming from a person with any repent or regret over what had happened , ' said Mr Abdullah . 'What most disappointed us was that he did not say he was sorry in the letter and in fact showed no conciliatory attitude . . . Anything can happen after this . ' Mr Keating had described Dr Mahathir as ' a recalcitrant ' for not attending last month 's Asia Pacific Economic Co-operation summit in Seattle . Several government departments in Malaysia have already taken action against Australia and Australian businessmen have said trade running at nearly Dollars 2bn ( Pounds 1.3bn ) a year could be jeopardised . Malaysia has become one of Australia 's more important export markets recently and Australian companies have been investing heavily in Malaysia 's fast-growing economy .
