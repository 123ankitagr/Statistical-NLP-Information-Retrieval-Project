my wife and i have just returned from our first vacation in new zealand it was a great success due to reading about june hawes of new zealand travel hosts jerry hulses travel tips feb 26 the farms and bbs that june reserved for us were excellent these are not the cheapest nor most expensive places to stay in new zealand but they are the best we feel that the people who were our hosts have become our friends they were important in helping us determine the best use of our time in their areas the optional evening dinners that are available were the best food we had on the trip we would recommend new zealand travel hosts especially for firsttime travelers to new zealand the address is new zealand travel hosts 279 williams st kaiapoi christchurch new zealand robert a mckenzie newport beach
