My wife and I have just returned from our first vacation in New Zealand . It was a great success , due to reading about June Hawes of New Zealand Travel Hosts ( Jerry Hulse 's Travel Tips , Feb. 26 ) . The farms and B & Bs that June reserved for us were excellent . These are not the cheapest ( nor most expensive ) places to stay in New Zealand , but they are the best . We feel that the people who were our hosts have become our friends . They were important in helping us determine the best use of our time in their areas . The optional evening dinners that are available were the best food we had on the trip . We would recommend New Zealand Travel Hosts , especially for first-time travelers to New Zealand . The address is New Zealand Travel Hosts , 279 Williams St. , Kaiapoi , Christchurch , New Zealand .
