Town Councilman Charles ( Bill ) Hansen found water for the new town hall the old-fashioned way . He dowsed it . Drillers from a local well company came up dry after drilling a 300-foot hole for the combination town hall and highway garage on a 28-acre parcel , the Schenectady Daily Gazette reported . Finding water on the parcel will tell builders where to place the building . Hansen took his forked oak rod and checked the lot himself , marking off a spot for the well driller . Within 150 feet , the well company hit a 20-gallon-per minute spring . Divining rods , when held by the two prongs , supposedly twitch over the spot where water runs underground .
