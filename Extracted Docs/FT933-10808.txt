sir your editorial lesson for israel july 29 calls for an explanation lebanon should be responsible for curbing the hizbollah alas lebanon being a subsidiary of syria allows it a free hand your leader speculates that israels activities will compromise the peace talks syria the most important negotiator with israel is actively supporting the hizbollah to talk peace on the one hand and to terrorise the north of israel on the other hand is simply unacceptable and if lebanon can not curb the terrorists and syria does not want to israel is left with no alternative but to do the job itself comparing the situation to bosnia is an unjust statement moslems in bosnia had no choice but to flee just because they were moslem and yes they fled inter alia to israel not to england the lebanese have a choice the hizbollah like any other entity can not survive within a hostile population terrorism against israel flourishes because hizbollah is supported by the shia inhabitants of south lebanon let the government of lebanon clean its back yard let the inhabitants of south lebanon express their hostility to the terrorist group israel will welcome these inhabitants back no israeli is pleased with these mass evacuations it is unfortunately the lesser of two evils which alternative can be solved by syria and lebanon zalli jaffe jaffe fund shefi co 31 ramban street jerusalem 91073 israel
