Max Laemmle , the Man Who Loved Movies , was a major force in Los Angeles film culture , not only for the films he presented but for his warm and generous collaboration with other film organizations . It was with the help of Laemmle ( who died Jan. 20 ) that the American Film Institute was able to reorganize the Los Angeles International Film Festival in 1987 ( replacing Filmex ) and present it at his Los Feliz Cinema . His collaboration with the AFI continued in specialized festivals at his Santa Monica Cinema devoted to European , British , U.S. independent and documentary films . He will be greatly missed .
