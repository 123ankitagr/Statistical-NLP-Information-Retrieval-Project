At 9.30 BBC1 begins five hours of American movies with Rain Man , the 1988 film which won Oscars for best film , best original screenplay and best direction . Some may think it does not seem that good : a rather static road movie in which a car dealer discovers that his autistic brother has a gift for memorising numbers . Moreover the BBC , as is now its habit , has censored it , so that no serious film enthusiast will want to see it . April Fool 's Day , which follows ( 11.45 ) , sounds like a latterday American version of the Agatha Christie classic 'Ten Little Niggers ' . The invitations to the sinister house on the island are the same , and although there are eight guests instead of 10 the general idea is remarkably similar . Cat 's Eye ( 1.10am ) is categorised as a horror movie , though it is a trio of Stephen King stories which , by modern standards , are pretty mild . Casual Sex ? ( BBC2 , 11.45 ) , yet another movie , was made five years ago and is very much in the modern mould : feminist , post-Aids attitudes to sex from two women who visit a health spa looking for romance
