Former welterweight contender Gypsy Joe Harris , whose promising boxing career ended with the discovery that he had concealed blindness in one eye , has died at age 44 . Harris , who suffered four heart attacks in the last two years , died Tuesday at Temple University Hospital , where he had been a patient since Feb. 10 . His sister , Daaiyah Waheed , attributed the death to heart failure . Harris was born in Camden , N.J. , and raised in North Philadelphia . A street fight blinded his right eye when he was 11 , but he pursued boxing anyway and won 24 of 25 fights . He lost his only fight on Aug. 6 , 1968 , in a decision to former champion Emile Griffith . A routine physical examination two months later by the Pennsylvania State Athletic Commission showed him to be blind in his right eye , and his boxing license was revoked .
