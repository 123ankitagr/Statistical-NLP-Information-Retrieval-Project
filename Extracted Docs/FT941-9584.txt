The board of Maclean Hunter , the Canadian publishing and broadcast group , will meet this week to consider its response to a takeover bid worth at least CDollars 2.8bn ( Pounds 1.42bn ) from Rogers Communications of Toronto . Rogers , which is Canada 's biggest cable TV distributor , ended two weeks of speculation last Friday by offering CDollars 17 per share , plus a portion of the proceeds from the sale of MH 's US cable TV franchises if they realise more than CDollars 1.5bn after expenses . Rogers has already bought an 8.3 per cent stake in MH on the open market . MH is unlikely to give its unqualified approval . Expectations that the Rogers offer is not the last word were reflected in a 38 per cent rise in MH 's share price last Friday to CDollars 17.38 . But Mr Ted Rogers , Rogers' chief executive , has insisted the bid will not be raised . The alternatives being explored by MH include alliances with other companies , a recapitalisation and the sale of its Canadian cable TV business . Among the uncertainties facing Rogers is whether the MH board will allow the bid . MH 's shareholder rights plan makes a takeover all but impossible unless it is permitted by the board . Mr Rogers claims the merger is needed to create a Canadian multi-media group powerful enough to stand up to big foreign predators and the domestic telephone industry .
