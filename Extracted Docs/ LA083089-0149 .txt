Frazier will reschedule a series of personal appearances for the next few months while he recuperates , Manager Burt Watson said . `` They checked him for broken bones , internal injuries and gave him an overall physical , '' said Watson . Although Frazier , 45 , was found to be in good shape , his doctors told him to take it easy for the next couple of weeks , Watson said . `` He needs to strengthen himself from being in there , '' said Watson . `` He needs to build his resistance back . '' Watson said Frazier was driving to his gym on Aug. 20 when his limousine was bumped from behind by a van .
