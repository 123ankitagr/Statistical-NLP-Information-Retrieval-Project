Air New Zealand expects profits for the current year to exceed comfortably the 37 per cent rise in tax-paid earnings to NZDollars 190m ( USDollars 118m ) achieved in the 12 months to last June , Mr Bob Matthew , chairman , told yesterday 's annual meeting in Wellington . He said the company expected to expand its international passenger capacity by more than 16 per cent this financial year . This would primarily stem from the introduction of new non-stop services between Los Angeles and Sydney en route to New Zealand , and new links from Brisbane to the new Japanese airport , Kansai . Mr Matthew criticised Canberra for this month 's decision to suspend unilaterally the single market aviation agreement with New Zealand , one week before Air New Zealand was due to have started domestic services within Australia . He said Australian travellers should not 'buy their government 's outrageous proposition ' that either Air New Zealand or its government was to blame for the collapse of the agreement , which would have brought downward pressures on Australian air fares . Mr Matthew added that both airline and government had maintained an unprovocative stance 'throughout this remarkable sequence of events ' , in spite of Australian initiatives to angle the competitive environment in favour of Ansett and Qantas , the Australian carriers . 'Matters must be put right if Air New Zealand is not to find itself commercially disadvantaged , ' he said . 'We hope we will not need to seek recourse by way of the various remedies available to us under the original agreement to which both governments are signatories . '
