the technologists politicians and policy thinktanks have all had their say on the information superhighway most agree that it will not only be a place to work but also to play films books and music are all expected to become widely accessible on-line' as the rush towards the information highway becomes a traffic jam but what of the artists whose work is supposed to become a featured attraction on this journey aside from the announced corporatist objectives of movie moguls such as george lucas and steven spielberg little has been heard from the artistic creative community a fresh perspective comes from william gibson the vancouver-based author who coined the term cyberspace in the mid-1980s in his best-selling science fiction novel neuromancer gibson says the whole notion of an information highway is misconceived he is firmly of the opinion that all the hoopla is nothing more than an attempt by industry to sell us things we don't want and by governments to be involved where they really aren't needed my feeling is that it all originates from an ad agency somewhere which is basically the us government he says wryly the notion of an information highway is a bogus metaphor what they are offering is a lot more like a shopping mall gibson also believes that business people and politicians have no concept of why the internet the best example yet of a so-called information highway in action is such a success with an estimated 30 m users worldwide the internet is strange it doesn't make any money it is transnational beyond anyone's control it is the great anarchist event says gibson if what these guys in governments and industry are calling the information highway is an infrastructure upgrade to fibre-optic cabling and high-speed switching systems that's great but if they want to create a system that is controlled and generates business it won't work he warns he doubts that the information highway will be commercially viable until whatever is behind the growth of the internet is better understood is it an historical anomaly or is there some inherent value in the technology used to create it he asks rhetorically gibson says that the mystery of the internet's success is likely to prevent it from being completely hijacked by commercial interests the commercial interests are looking at this as a medium like television he notes but it is actually much more like a language than a traditional medium of communication gibson says it is the universality of the internet that makes it similar to a language it is open to everyone and used by all manner of people this universality is evident when you start browsing around the discussion areas which include everything from pornography to religious fundamentalism to topics in the news the internet also provides the means to break down government-imposed barriers during the darkest days of the 1991 failed coup attempt against mikhail gorbachev in the old soviet union for example it was the internet that provided an international route out for many messages about what was really happening despite its usefulness as a mechanism for free speech gibson says it is still hard to define what anybody means when they talk about an information highway he suggests that the technology underlying any information highway is currently akin to the many mechanical devices designed in the victorian era to achieve cinema-like effects before the first really effective uses of film technology arrived he adds that this is partly because the potential of the various converged technologies is not really apparent until the convergence takes place and suggests that if you look back to the turn of the century and read the victorians visions of what life would be like in 2000, you get some idea of how the public fascination with the possibilities of emerging technologies often outstrips any kind of realistic analysis of what the future might hold
