Two-term Florida Democratic Rep. Bill Grant delivered a political gift to President Bush at the White House today by joining the Republican Party . `` I just wanted to bring Congressman Grant in here to say how pleased I am that he is switching over to become a Republican , '' Bush said in opening a White House news conference with Grant at his side . Republicans , despite Bush 's landslide win over Michael S. Dukakis on Nov. 8 , lost congressional seats to Democrats , who maintain large majorities in the House and Senate . With the change , Democrats will hold a 258-to-175 majority in the House . There are two vacancies . A lifelong Democrat , Grant , 45 , had no opposition in the November election . Grant , who is rated a moderate Democrat by the American Conservative Union , said he was switching because he can better serve his district `` in a working partnership , with this President , with this Administration and with this party . '' House Speaker Jim Wright ( D-Tex . ) , asked about Grant 's defection from the majority party , said : `` It took me by surprise , but that 's everyone 's choice . I hope he 's happy . '' His conversion reverses the division of Florida 's delegation to Congress , giving the state 10 Republicans and nine Democrats .
