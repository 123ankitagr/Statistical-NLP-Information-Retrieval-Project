You present a cogent editorial on the dangers of smoking . It calls for action now ! It points to the deaths and illnesses and economic losses caused by smoking . . . and then it asks what are the Bush Administration 's plans to do something about it . The front page and the Business section run stories about how the tobacco companies aim their advertising at young , at minorities and at women trying to lure them to this insidious drug . But your same newspaper runs full-page ads for cigarettes and tobacco products . Apparently the same people who write your editorials do n't control your advertising . Apparently promoting addictive drugs that kill and main outweighs the loss of advertising income . Do n't ask what the Bush Administration will do about smoking ; what will The Times do about it .
