you present a cogent editorial on the dangers of smoking it calls for action now it points to the deaths and illnesses and economic losses caused by smoking and then it asks what are the bush administrations plans to do something about it the front page and the business section run stories about how the tobacco companies aim their advertising at young at minorities and at women trying to lure them to this insidious drug but your same newspaper runs fullpage ads for cigarettes and tobacco products apparently the same people who write your editorials dont control your advertising apparently promoting addictive drugs that kill and main outweighs the loss of advertising income dont ask what the bush administration will do about smoking what will the times do about it bob firestone md nipomo
