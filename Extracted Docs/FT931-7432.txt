AECI , South Africa 's largest chemicals group , is to build a R300m ( Dollars 96m ) plant producing lysine , an amino acid used in pig and poultry feed . AECI wants to shift away from commodity chemicals towards higher value-added chemical products and the biotechnology market . AECI 's heavy exposure to commodity chemicals has hit it hard over the past three years . Earnings have nearly halved since 1989 . Last week , AECI , in which ICI , of the UK , has a 38 per cent stake , reported a 12 per cent drop in attributable earnings for 1992 , down to R164m . The plant , to be built at AECI 's Umbogontwini factory south of Durban , will produce 11,000 tonnes of lysine a year . Start-up is due for 1995 . The plant 's main raw material will be 30,000 tonnes a year of sugar . The world market for lysine is about 165,000 tonnes a year .
