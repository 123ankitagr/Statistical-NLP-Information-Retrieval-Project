i am a hemodialysis patient who depends on dialysis three times a week to survive medicare has informed us who dialyze at home that congress has cut costs by 50 on method ii dialysis which will affect many dialysis patients like myself this will mean going back to a unit where the care is not as good as what you receive at home what upsets me is reading in the paper where president bush has approved salary increases of up to 35 for top government workers and yet has done nothing to solve this medicare crisis all i can say is where is the justice by doing this deborah carrillo lakewood
