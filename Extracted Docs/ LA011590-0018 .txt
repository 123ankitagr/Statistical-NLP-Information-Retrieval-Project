I am a hemodialysis patient who depends on dialysis three times a week to survive . Medicare has informed us who dialyze at home that Congress has cut costs by 50 % on Method II dialysis which will affect many dialysis patients like myself . This will mean going back to a unit where the care is not as good as what you receive at home . What upsets me is reading in the paper where President Bush has approved salary increases of up to 35 % for top government workers and yet has done nothing to solve this Medicare crisis . All I can say is where is the justice by doing this ? DEBORAH CARRILLO Lakewood
