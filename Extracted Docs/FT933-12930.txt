conflicting signals emerged yesterday over the course of german monetary policy when money supply exceeded the target range set by the bundesbank for the third month in a row hopes that the central bank would be able to speed up its phased reduction of interest rates were raised earlier in the day when the bundesbank made a deeper than expected cut in the minimum money-market securities repurchase rate according to provisional figures released yesterday by the bundesbank the m3 broad money measure climbed at an annualised seasonally adjusted rate of 7.1 per cent in june on tuesday night mr johann gaddum a member of the bundesbank's directorate had said that the money supply target range of 3.5 5.5 per cent growth was attainable but conceded that progress towards the goal was not over the hill coming after 6.9 per cent growth in may yesterday's figure was both a surprise and a disappointment for economists who had hoped for a lower figure perhaps within the 4.5 6.5 per cent target range the poor figures reflecting growth in public sector borrowing led economists to predict that the bundesbank would not move to cut headline interest rates at next thursday's meeting of the policy-making council the last time the council meets again before september earlier in the day however the bundesbank made a deeper than expected cut in the repo rate the rate at which the bundesbank provides wholesale funds for the market it fell to 7.15 per cent down from 7.28 per cent last week this was better than traders expectations of a fall to 7.18 7.20 per cent and brings the repo rate closer to the floor set by the discount rate currently at 6.75 per cent after being reduced by half a percentage point at the beginning of july the latest bundesbank monthly report said that a brightening of the monetary environment was one reason for the generous cuts in the discount and lombard rate on july 1 talk of another july rate cut was sparked earlier this month by speculative pressure on the french franc and danish krona in the exchange rate mechanism of the ems but the speculative pressures have since abated shifting the markets focus back to germany's domestic monetary goals with m3 running at such a high level it will be difficult for the bundesbank to justify any further cuts said mr hermann remsperger chief economist at the bhf-bank yesterday the figures showed that lending to businesses and private individuals rose at a seasonally-adjusted annualised rate of 7.5 per cent in the first half of year the chance of another rate cut is virtually zero now said mr klaus baader ubs phillips drew economist in london the federation of german banks said that a further rate cut would encourage economic growth in germany which is mired in recession but it said the central bank had to move carefully because of stubbornly high inflation and the need to maintain confidence in the d-mark german bankers are concerned that if rate cuts came too rapidly the d-mark would come under pressure a central factor behind the unexpected increase in m3 was a rise in foreign currency assets of the banking sector the reason for this puzzled economists but ms alison cottrell of midland global markets research in london said it probably reflected the effects of the bundesbank's previous currency market intervention meanwhile the next provisional inflation figures are likely to show consumer prices rising at 4.3 per cent up from 4.2 per cent in june and more than twice the bundesbank's long-term target of 2 per cent
