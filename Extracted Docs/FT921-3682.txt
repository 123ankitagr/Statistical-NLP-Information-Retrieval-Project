robotic eyes can now be made from a photosensitive protein called bacteriorhodopsin br found in saltsaturated water such as the dead sea a team from fuji photo film in japan has developed a retinalike light sensor which rivals the most sophisticated silicon devices it mimics some of the functions of the eye in a simpler less costly and more compact package the sensor is constructed by wedging a thin film of the protein between two oxide electrodes in an electrically conductive gel when light hits the sensor the br molecules react by changing shape generating a quick electric pulse that travels through the electrode but if the light remains constant the protein returns to its original shape no charge is generated until the light level changes again potential applications include recognition systems for security purposes and factory automation fuji photo film japan 04 6573 7070
