The mayors of Dallas and Ft. Worth easily won reelection Saturday , and San Antonio 's former mayor regained her office by a commanding margin as elections were held in four Texas cities . The least predictable contest appeared to be for mayor in El Paso , where political observers forecast a runoff from the six-candidate race . In Dallas , with 151 of 299 precincts reporting , Mayor Annette Strauss had 73 % of the vote to 20 % for attorney Peter Lesser . In San Antonio , former Mayor Lila Cockrell won with 59 % of the vote to 31 % for insurance executive Carl Mauthe . Cockrell , who was mayor of San Antonio from 1975 to 1981 , was supported by the man who replaced her , Henry G. Cisneros , a leading Latino political figure . Cisneros , beset by personal problems , decided against seeking a fifth term . Ft. Worth Mayor Bob Bolen , who faced no serious opposition in his bid for a fourth two-year term , won with 89 % of the tally . In El Paso , with only absentee ballots counted , City Council member Suzy Azar had 32 % of the vote total to 27 % for Mayor Pro Tem Ed Elsey . The other four candidates did not receive significant votes . If no one gets a majority of the vote , the top two finishers will face off May 27 .
