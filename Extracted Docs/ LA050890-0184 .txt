State-owned El Al Israel Airlines today reported profit of $ 24.2 million for 1989 , its fourth consecutive year in the black . The profit marked a 28.7 % jump from El Al 's 1988 earnings of $ 18.8 million . Revenues rose 7.2 % to $ 713.6 million from $ 665.3 million in 1988 . El Al said it carried 1.74 million passengers last year , 12 % more than in 1988 , when tourism to Israel fell sharply in the early months of a Palestinian uprising in Israeli-annexed East Jerusalem and the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip . The sustained profitability is likely to enhance prospects of floating El Al shares on the Tel Aviv and foreign stock exchanges , proposed as part of Israel 's privatization drive .
