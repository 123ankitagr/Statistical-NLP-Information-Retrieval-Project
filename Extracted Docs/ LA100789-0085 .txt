president bush on friday firmly defended his administrations action during the failed coup in panama saying that he would do nothing differently but leading senate democrats blamed him personally for a confused and erratic us response this administration has good people but policy guidance has to start with the president said senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga who charged that the administration was caught without any plan of action occasionally we ought to foresee that our policy of encouraging a coup might succeed and we ought to be prepared administration officials acknowledged that tuesdays coup attempt bushs first foreign crisis has exposed organizational problems in the way the white house handles such emergencies as late as friday for example senior officials could not agree on what orders had been given to us troops in panama and as the confusion continued senior officials began blaming each other for lapses and while attention appeared to center on those institutional failures the weeks events also have called attention to a sharp division within official washington about how to handle panama and its controversial leader gen manuel a noriega many lawmakers assert that the president should be prepared to move aggressively against the panamanian strongman but administration officials appear increasingly to favor a policy of restraint would not change decision even in retrospect bush insisted that he would not change his decision against using us troops to ensure the coups success i dont see anything now that would have made me make a different decision he told reporters after emerging from walter reed army medical center where he underwent an operation to remove a cyst from his finger nunn and senate intelligence committee chairman david l boren dokla said the president had an obligation to issue detailed instructions to us personnel in panama telling them what to do in the event of a coup attempt they also said that us officials should have been instructed to ask the rebels in advance of their attempted revolt whether they intended to recognize a duly elected government which noriega has refused to do if the rebels had been asked that question and if they had promised to install an elected government nunn said the united states would then have had the moral basis on which to use military force to support the coup there are certainly circumstances under which american troops can be used he said on capitol hill sentiment seems to have grown for strong us actions to remove noriega perhaps even extending to the direct use of us troops but within the administration this weeks failure has accelerated a move in the other direction emphasized caution bush and secretary of defense dick cheney for example emphasized caution in their comments what people some people seem to have wanted me to do is to unleash the full military to go in and quote get noriega said bush i suppose you could have gone to general quarters but thats not prudent and thats not the way i plan to conduct the military or foreign affairs of this country late thursday cheney noted that we could if the president gave me the order tonight we could have noriega out of there probably by midnight but one of the questions you have to ask yourself is how many dead americans is gen noriega worth and under what circumstances are you prepared to use that kind of force his tone a senior administration aide said reflected a conscious decision to try to move public attention away from a foreign policy area that has become a frustrating embarrassment every administration that knows what its doing tries to downplay things that dont go well the aide said subject of recriminations within the administration panama has rapidly become a subject of recriminations several officials said a senior pentagon official identified white house chief of staff john h sununu as the source of a number of comments critical of the pentagons handling of the crisis another administration official confirmed that sununu had spread word that he was dissatisfied with how the national security council had responded to the events cheney defended his departments actions the only thing i can suggest is that as is true a lot of places not all the mondaymorning quarterbacks reside on capitol hill he said when asked about criticism from administration colleagues regardless of who bears the blame reconstructions of tuesdays events make clear that at key points the administrations response was confused it was not at all clear however that a more coherent response would have led to a different outcome the full story isnt in yet theyre still trying to sort it out said one administration official but he added there was no clear line of authority that would lead to a presidential decision on how to handle the coup there were a lot of people providing information and periodically the president was informed there was no clear opportunity for the president to say ok lets go get him or lets stay out of it we may have done the right thing the official concluded but we stumbled into it nunn and boren criticized administration policymakers both in panama and at the white house for failing to consult with officials in the cia as the coup unfolded as a result they said decisions were made without adequate information according to boren no one from the cia was invited to attend either of the two important decisionmaking meetings tuesday between the president and his aides in the white house situation room it is highly unusual for the cia to be excluded from such meetings perhaps the clearest examples of the confusion involved the movements of us troops to block two key roads that pronoriega soldiers were expected to use to go to the generals rescue the troop movements had been requested by the leader of the coup maj moises giroldi vega in a meeting with us officials sunday even friday three days after the failed coup us officials could not agree what orders those troops had been given asked if the troops were authorized to block noriegas soldiers if they attempted to move white house press secretary marlin fitzwater replied yes but cheney asked the same question said no thats the kind of decision that would have come up the chain rapidly to the president and he would have been given the opportunity to make the broad policy decision yes we want to intervene militarily that decision was never made cheney said in the end noriegas supporters made the question moot by taking a third road but once that happened us officials apparently failed to tell either the rebels or bush according to boren who was briefed extensively by the cia cheney and gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff white house officials apparently chose not to interrupt bushs meeting with mexican president carlos salinas de gortari to ask the president whether american soldiers should be stationed on that third road the coup might have succeeded if the president had decided to block the road that the noriega forces were using boren claimed the real question is why did we let the coup fail boren said the president should have been given a yes or no option on whether to block that road cable supports assertion both boren and nunn said they currently accept cheneys assertion that the rebels refused to turn noriega over to us officials they said that account is supported by a cable from us military officials in panama to washington but boren said they also have seen another cable sent to washington by us intelligence officials in panama saying that members of the coup wanted us personnel to take noriega while he was still in rebel custody cheney told the senators that this second cable was based on a misunderstanding when asked by his aides to decide whether us troops should take custody of noriega according to boren the president replied only if hes delivered onto american territory times staff writers john m broder and melissa healy contributed to this report
