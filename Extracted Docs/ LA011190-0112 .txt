El Camino lost its South Coast Conference basketball opener to a mediocre team on Saturday , but last night the Warriors got revenge with an 85-74 victory over Pasadena at the Lancer gym . For one half the seventh-ranked Warriors ( 15-5 , 1-1 ) took it out on the Lancers , who made an incredible second-half effort to save their SCC opener . Pasadena ( 10-11 , 0-1 ) found it difficult to keep up with El Camino 's intense defense and fast-paced offense . The Warriors scored 12 unanswered points early in the game , which put them ahead 18-5 with 13:35 left in the half . Less than a minute later El Camino went on a nine-point run capped by freshman Michael Houck 's three-point play that gave the Warriors a 27-11 lead . Pasadena 's virtually non-existant shooting and an array of turnovers in the first half assisted El Camino which held a 41-28 halftime edge . The Warriors kept the streak going for the first part of the second half . With 14:34 left to play El Camino had a comfortable 21-point lead . Perhaps El Camino got too comfortable because Pasadena shaved the lead to six after David Phillips ' three-point shot with 1:01 remaining in the game . El Camino will travel to Cerritos for Saturday 's SCC game at 7:30 p.m. IRENE GARCIA
