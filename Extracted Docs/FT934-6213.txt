south korea has reasserted its influence in the negotiations to resolve the north korean nuclear issue but at a possible cost of delaying a quick solution to the dispute in his meeting with president bill clinton in washington on tuesday south korean president kim young-sam sidetracked a us proposal that would have suspended the joint team spirit military exercise in return for north korea accepting the resumption of routine international nuclear inspections and exchanging special envoys with seoul to discuss nuclear issues instead the two leaders said the north would have to fulfil the two conditions before concessions would be made the statement amounted to a rejection of a recent north korean proposal that washington and pyongyang make simultaneous compromises as part of a package solution south korea has been concerned about recent us press reports that washington was seriously considering the north korean offer which conflicts with seoul's position that pyongyang has to make the first concession the unease felt by south korean officials over the north's proposal was that it would lead to direct negotiations between pyongyang and washington leaving seoul on the sidelines the main worry expressed by south korean officials was that the talks between washington and pyongyang would focus on inspections conducted by the international atomic energy agency iaea ignoring the issue of inter-korean nuclear inspections mutual nuclear inspections between the two koreas lie at the heart of the present dispute seoul demanded last year that north korea accept inspections of suspected nuclear facilities in compliance with a bilateral non-nuclear treaty that north and south korea signed in december 1991 pyongyang refused the request explaining the treaty did not support this demand in response seoul sought to press pyongyang by asking washington to resume the annual us-south korean team spirit military exercise this year south korean foreign ministry officials say team spirit had been suspended in 1992 as a goodwill gesture by washington in response to north korea's signing of the non-nuclear treaty with the south shortly after pyongyang agreed to accept routine iaea inspections of its nuclear facilities but last autumn's decision to resume team spirit angered pyongyang last march it threatened to pull out of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and stop iaea inspections citing resumption of team spirit as one reason and protesting at an iaea demand that it accept inspections of undeclared facilities some analysts believe north korea refused the iaea request for special inspections because it would have created a precedent for accepting similar inspections by south korea the issue at the centre of their disagreements over mutual inspections
