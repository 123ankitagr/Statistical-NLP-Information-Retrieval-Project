The deadlock over the appointment of the fifth member to the Santa Monica Rent Control Board , which had threatened to indefinitely hamper board business , was broken Thursday night with the selection of Jay P. Johnson , 47 , an apartment owner who supports rent control . Board member Eileen Lipson , who had sided with board member Dolores Press in the deadlock against board Chairwoman Susan Packer Davis and board member Wayne Bauer , said she swung her vote because she thinks Johnson is open-minded and `` a person of great integrity . '' The board had been trying since Jan. 22 to agree on a replacement for Julie Lopez Dad , who resigned late last year . Johnson 's appointment comes at a time when the city 's rent control ordinance , considered among the toughest in the nation , is under attack by landlords .
