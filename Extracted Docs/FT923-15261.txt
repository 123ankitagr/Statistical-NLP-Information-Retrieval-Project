private sector insurance companies are to wrest shortterm export credit business in the european community from statebacked insurers according to proposals to be presented in two weeks to the ec council working group on export finance the proposals expected to come into force before the beginning of the european single market in january next year are intended to create a level playing field for exporters inside the ec by removing distortions in export credit terms arising from government subsidies government export credit insurance would be confined to the underwriting of noncommercial political risk business the reforms could lead to a significant expansion of private sector involvement in providing export credit insurance they are controversial because many statebacked insurers use the profits usually generated from insuring shortterm trade to subsidise losses often arising from insuring medium and longterm business they are expected to increase the cost of shortterm export credit cover particularly to small companies they are also expected to lead to pressure inside the oecd for japan the us and other leading industrial countries to follow suit companies like ncm the dutch insurer that bought the shortterm credit arm of britains export credits guarantee department late last year have naturally welcomed the proposed change the main resistance has come from germany italy and france where statebacked companies control effective monopolies on providing export credit insurance the new regime will apply to marketable risk on contracts of up to two years it will include both political and commercial risk cover on exports to member states of the ec or other highly creditworthy countries like the us japan or sweden but will continue to rely on governmentbacked reinsurance for political risk in smaller or more volatile markets we plan to start more narrowly and widen the scope of commercial involvement when the market has caught up with any problems said mr allan dalvin head of the division for export credits and export promotion in the ecs external relations directorate we expect most countries to criticise certain areas of our proposals but to be in favour with the general approach he said those that have already gone a long way on commercialising will want to go faster the ec pinpoints four main distortions that have prevented private insurers from competing with statebacked organisations in providing export insurance state guarantees or loans free information or facilities tax exemptions in many forms and monopoly control of reinsurance russia will soon clamp down on companies to stop them wasting valuable export credits mr pyotr aven the foreign trade minister said in an interview yesterday reuter reports from moscow we plan to change the system of distributing investment credits fundamentally we will not allow people to spend hard currency on technical equipment which later disappears he told the daily trud newspaper over the last 20 years foreign machinery worth many millions of dollars has been imported and either left to rust or been stolen he said vetted companies would only receive credits by bidding for them at auctions
