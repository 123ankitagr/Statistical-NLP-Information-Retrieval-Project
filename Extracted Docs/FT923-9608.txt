mercury communications yesterday challenged claims made by british telecommunications that it was winning back substantial numbers of business customers from its main competitor mr peter howell-davies deputy chief executive of mercury said that bt had won back only about pounds 6 m of business from mercury compared with an increase in mercury's order book of pounds 300 m in the past financial year a comparison of the figures indicated that bt's impact has been negligible he said mercury was responding to a claim made by bt at its annual general meeting on july 30 that it was succeeding in winning back business customers from mercury and fending off competition from cable tv companies mercury said it had arrived at the figure of pounds 6 m from its own market sources the figure did not mean that bt has won back a number of business customers altogether but represented just 45 customers at an average of pounds 133,000 per customer mercury said as business customers tended to use bt for local calls and mercury for long-distance and international calls the business that has been won back by bt could represent a slight shift in balance between the use of the respective services mercury added that it was continuing to increase its customer base at a rate of about 19,000 a month of these some 12,000 were for its own residential services and about 7,000 were for services provided in partnership with cable tv operators mercury provides services in partnership with cable operators in areas including birmingham portsmouth bristol and london these services provide users with competitive rates for long-distance international and local calls
