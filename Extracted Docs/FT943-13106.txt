the bundesbanks credibility has been called into question and its monetary management methods have been mocked but both of these totems counted among its most prized assets appear likely to emerge intact from the travails of the past few months mr hans tietmeyer the german central banks president may even come through with his reputation as a pragmatic monetarist enhanced the record of mr otmar issing the banks high priest of monetary orthodoxy may be similarly embellished both together with their fellows on the banks central council are already a little wiser and keen on learning more no one wants a repetition of this years experiences with the banks main policy guidance system the m3 monetary aggregate which went haywire at the turn of the year and is only now settling down and while the banks policymakers seem to enjoy springing surprises with the timing of their interest rate changes the markets bewilderment at their last discount rate cut in midmay is not an experience they want to repeat some signs of new thinking may emerge today after the councils midyear review of m3 performance but it is already plain the overriding message will be a reaffirmation of faith in monetary targeting even though the concept has been dropped in all other leading industrial countries the bundesbank insists it is the most reliable indicator of possible inflation the m3 components of cash or shortterm easilyaccessible savings not safely locked up in longterm bonds or other instruments socalled monetary capital are a potential threat to monetary stability it says accordingly the idea that the bank should welcome news that money supply is expanding at double its intended rate would in normal circumstances be beyond belief but that was the case on tuesday this week when it announced m3 grew in june at an annualised seasonallyadjusted 113 per cent compared with the target range of 46 per cent the fact that the result was better than bundesbank watchers had expected was one reason for satisfaction but more important the fact that the figures showed special factors that bloated the measure were starting to unwind tended to support mr otmar issings fundamental belief in the underlying virtues of m3 but the council will today examine a wider horizon than the two percentage point span of this years target range mr tietmeyer said yesterday the bank was studying new factors which could influence m3 new phenomena stemming from the internationalisation of capital movements in the light of widespread scepticism about the usefulness of the measure it may also contemplate ways of sharpening assessment of the apparently endless flow of the distorting special factors the effects of german unification tax changes and currency market interventions for example have conspired to keep m3 off track for the past three years as mr tietmeyer suggested future shocks are more likely than not as germany becomes increasingly enmeshed in fastmoving global markets one aim of the central council debate will be to sharpen the efficiency of the banks longrange radar another will be to improve internal and external communications failings in both departments appeared to catch the bank napping earlier this year when januarys m3 growth figure a thundering 212 per cent came in accompanied by a bland statement blaming special factors a selloff followed in international markets already rattled by fears of rising us inflation it was not as mr tietmeyer acknowledged a championship performance but conflicting statements and apparently contradictory actions by the bank were later to compound suspicions that it did not really know what was happening to m3 the liquidity logjam was refusing to break up meanwhile and contrary to its established practice of raising rates to choke off monetary growth and potential inflation the bank was seen to be cutting them on the basis of a bright shortterm inflationary outlook the midmay cut in the discount rate was widely seen as an uncharacteristic gamble by a notoriously conservative institution that view has moderated now that funds stuck in shortterm deposits seem to be moving outside the scope of m3 an emboldened mr issing said earlier this week it was now not beyond the bounds of possibility for m3 to end the year at or close to target similarly encouraged mr tietmeyer said yesterday the bank believed there were so far no inflationary dangers associated with the latest bout of money supply distortions such comforting comments will no doubt go down well in stilljittery markets more comforting still would be a continuing series of declining m3 numbers for the rest of the year even better and despite recent controversy another discount rate cut in the interim would be the strongest possible indicator that the bundesbank had regained its full confidence in m3 and crucially in its ability to interpret and control it
