mr david blunkett labour spokesman on local government said yesterday that recent government figures on council spending showed yet another fundamental flaw in the governments system of standard spending assessments the assessments are used to estimate how much councils need to spend on the services they provide the party said the figures showed that some councils were gaining government grant from the way in which the central grant system took account of the cost of servicing council debt discrepancies occur because grant is distributed according to notional rather than actual debt for each council the total for capital financing however is based on the total actually spent the current rules on taking account of capital financing mean torycontrolled westminster for example benefits by almost pounds 100 per polltax payer and labour lewisham by more than pounds 50 a head tory huntingdon loses by slightly more than pounds 45 a head as does labour thurrock labour said yesterday that it would make the discrepancy a priority in an urgent review of spending assessments its reform of the grant system would add new factors to the assessments they would include factors such as unemployment rates mortality rates and total disposable income mr michael portillo minister for local government defended the system saying if you base grant on actual debt charges you reward overspending and penalise prudent authorities labour says the debt was governmentsanctioned because councils were not prevented from borrowing above credit approval limits ministers argue that authorities should not be bailed out for choosing to incur larger debts labour estimates that its planned changes would eventually mean a shift in grant away from shire districts and towards urban areas the possibility of assessing social need differently in london from the rest of the country could mean that the effect of the changes was less straightforward in the capital reforms would almost certainly be phased in perhaps with a safety net preventing an authority losing more than a set proportion of its grant in a single year the first changes would be made in time for determining grant in 199394 in a few key areas such as provision for the underfives labour would consider withholding grant unless councils actually provided a minimum service while the tories say this amounts to more central control labour compares it with the governments use of grants for specific purposes only
