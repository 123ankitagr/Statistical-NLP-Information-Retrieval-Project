Mayor Marion Barry , bowing to a chief demand of students occupying two buildings at the University of the District of Columbia , said he will ask 10 of the school 's 15 trustees to resign . However , the mayor added that he is powerless to force anyone on the trustee board to quit . `` We had a good dialogue , a good session , '' the mayor said after emerging from a 4 1/2-hour meeting with students who have occupied the two buildings at the city-run university since Wednesday .
