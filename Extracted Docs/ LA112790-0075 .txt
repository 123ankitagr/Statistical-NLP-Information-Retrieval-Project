Lancaster Mayor William Pursley earned a real estate commission of about $ 10,000 on the sale of property that the mayor promoted by obtaining a special city exemption , according to associates . Mid Valley Real Estate in Lancaster , where the mayor works as an agent , confirmed Monday that Pursley received a $ 9,780.15 sales commission for representing his business partner , who was selling the land when Pursley asked the council for the exemption . The district attorney 's office said Monday that it will review the case to determine whether to open a criminal investigation because of the disclosure that Pursley may have profited from his June council vote . Pursley , who was elected to the Lancaster council in March , 1989 , and selected mayor by his council colleagues this April , was out of the city and unavailable for comment , city officials said . He had previously denied any wrongdoing in connection with the vote .
