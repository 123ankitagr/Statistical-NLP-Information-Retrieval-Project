The Los Angeles City Council last week approved replacing standard twist-style doorknobs with special levers on 121 doors in nine city buildings to help disabled people gain greater access . Councilman Marvin Braude sponsored the motion , saying traditional doorknobs are difficult for people in wheelchairs to open . Doorknobs will be converted in all three downtown City Hall buildings , the Van Nuys City Hall and municipal buildings in San Pedro , Watts , Sunland-Tujunga , West Los Angeles and the West Valley at an anticipated cost of $ 27,781 .
