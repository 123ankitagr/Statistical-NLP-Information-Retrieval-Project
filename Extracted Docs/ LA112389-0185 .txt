Recently Australia asked for the resumption of close political and military ties with New Zealand , but the plea was snubbed by Secretary of State James A. Baker and Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney . Baker said the Wellington government 's continued refusal to permit U.S. nuclear-powered ships to call at New Zealand ports undermined basic U.S. defense strategy . New Zealand is right not to want nuclear-powered vessels at its ports . One of the few nuclear-free zones left on this earth is the South Pacific . In order to annihilate the threat of a nuclear war we need more countries in the world that will stand up for arms reduction . I commend Australia and New Zealand for their effort .
