A SENIOR Tory Euro-sceptic MP will meet his local party today to discuss whether to leave politics , David Owen writes . If Sir Richard Body resigned from parliament it would trigger a by-election which might narrow the government 's precarious 17-strong majority . Sir Richard , MP for Holland with Boston in Lincolnshire , yesterday said he had received a 'very tempting ' offer from a publishing company to write books about Europe and agriculture . Sir Richard , widely believed to be among the Tory rebels described this week as 'barmy ' by Mr John Major , the prime minister , acknowledged yesterday that he might resign . But he said he hoped a compromise could be reached enabling him to remain an MP and write books . Sir Richard 's majority was nearly 14,000 at the last general election .
