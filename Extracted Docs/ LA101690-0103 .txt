The city of Ventura received backing for a $ 127,151 grant to help restore Marina Park , a popular seaside playground and picnic spot that in recent years has suffered from storm damage and sea erosion . The Marina Park grant , one of 16 in California in the 1989-90 allocation from the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund , must be presented to the National Park Service for final approval . It got preliminary approval from the state Parks and Recreation Department . Marina Park is on Pierpont Bay just north of the Ventura Marina at the southern tip of San Buenaventura State Beach . Its main attraction for the dozens of children who visit every day is an old pirate ship marooned on a sandlot . The grant would be used to repair walkways , replace security lights , restore dunes and do minor landscaping , said Rose Mary Bauer of the city Parks and Recreation Department . `` The grant will help us complete the park restoration project we began two years ago , '' Bauer said . The city also allocated $ 258,400 of its own funds for improvements to Marina Park . SANTIAGO O'DONNELL
