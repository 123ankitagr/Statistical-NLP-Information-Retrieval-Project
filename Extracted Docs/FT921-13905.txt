you are probably groaning already thanks to salesmen most people know how to buy life insurance overselling has given the product a bad name but that does not mean that the product is not worth having just make sure you do not wait until a salesman contacts you before buying life cover work out your own requirements then decide which cover if any is the most appropriate for you finally go to an independent intermediary who can look for the best rate the life industry is fiercely competitive so shopping around will always be worthwhile also make sure to check how much life cover you have through your employer many companies will insure your life for two or three times salary which reduces your need for extra cover there are two events in your life when you will probably most need cover when you buy a house and when you become a parent mortgage lenders are not happy about lending money if they have to bear the risk that you will die before it is paid off in any case you will want to buy life cover for at least the cost of the house once you have children it would be irresponsible not to cover your life quite how much cover you need is a moot point however and the best way to approach it is to work out how much money your children would need to continue their lifestyle if you were to die there are other uses for life assurance products in more complicated financial planning packages but this article assumes that all you want to do is cover your life life products come in three basic forms term assurance is the most similar to a straightforward general insurance contract you insure against dying within a fixed term of years if you survive the term the insurance company pockets all the premiums you have paid in if you die the company pays your nextofkin an amount agreed at the beginning of the policy wholeoflife assurance as its name implies lasts for the whole of your life this makes it a very different beast from general insurance because there is no risk involved as to the final payout the underwriters know you are going to die and that some time sooner or later they will have to pay out unlike term assurance you can cancel a wholeoflife policy and recoup some of the money paid in as premiums endowments have elements of both they cover your life for a fixed term like term assurance but they guarantee to pay you the sum assured at the end of the term even if you are still alive life companies invest the premiums for a profit so it soon became the custom to pay out the sum assured along with the profits made on it at the end of the term this led to the term withprofits unitlinked endowments are also available which is the most appropriate if you want to protect your children then the straightforward term assurance is the best bet with luck they will be over the age of 50 before you die and will not be in great need of a payout from a wholeoflife policy term assurance allows you to cover only the vital period before they gain their financial independence the gap in premiums paid for term and endowment policies is large for example from pearl assurance the monthly premium for a 29yearold man taking out 25year term insurance for pounds 50000 is pounds 18 or pounds 2150 if he smokes the premium for the same man to take out the same amount of cover via an endowment would be pounds 6250 endowments often turn out to be a good investment but that is no reason to take on extra outlay when you will probably be spending a lot on such items as nappies and baby food so all you need to do is insure yourself against dying within a certain term working out the precise term is a difficult and personal decision the rules of thumb used by peter hargreaves of hargreaves lansdown are to look for about a 15year term for the mother as children above this age are not liable to need expensive nannying and supervision for the higher earner mother or father he suggests an 18year term which should see the children through until they leave school insurance companies are unlikely to leave it as simple as this for example you can take out two individual policies or joint life assurance which pays out on the first death this might be a cheaper alternative seek quotes for both then you might opt to take the cover in the form of a regular income rather than one lump sum either option might make sense again get your broker to obtain quotes decide how much you can pay in the next few years it is not always a good idea to go for the cheapest offer as it might cost more in the long run but if your cash flow is a problem insurers do offer lowstart policies the options might include taking out insurance only for a short term for example five years putting up with the fact that premiums will be slightly higher when the next term starts in five years time and that you will not be able to take out cover if your health has declined significantly convertible term assurance which insures you for a short term but give you the right to convert into an endowment or a wholeoflife policy you have guaranteed reinsurability if you become uninsurable for example because of a heart attack during the first fiveyear term you can still take out more insurance renewable term cover also buys guaranteed reinsurability and the right to continue term assurance without having a medical test several advisers such as mark bolland of chamberlain de broe are keen on this option as a more longsighted way of saving cash flow the renewable option certainly starts cheaper according to baronworth an ilfordbased independent adviser the best rate for a 29yearold nonsmoking man taking out 25year cover of pounds 50000 is pounds 660 per month from premium life but this is a renewable contract it might increase after five years other strong renewable offers come from albany life pounds 10 premium for pounds 62992 cover and legal general pounds 1060 for pounds 50000 the cheapest fixedrate cover came from permanent pounds 1020 followed by norwich union pounds 1170 and commercial union pounds 1200 if you can take out insurance for the full term you require from the beginning follow these guidelines and you will have fulfilled your responsibilities to your family whatever you do do not confirm the old salesmans adage life insurance isnt bought it needs to be sold next week how to cover your life when taking out a
