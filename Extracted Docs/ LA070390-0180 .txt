West German players wilted in their World Cup quarterfinal against Czechoslovakia because they had been eating too much meat and not enough carbohydrate-rich pasta , according to team doctor Franz Liesen . `` This was the result of completely wrong nutrition , '' he said . `` The players have eaten too much meat and not enough pasta . The lack of carbohydrates caused a crisis in the second half . '' Liesen said he had to give an injection of vitamins to each player after the match to `` reestablish the necessary equilibrium in their bodies . '' West German team chief Franz Beckenbauer acknowledged the players had been tired during the quarterfinal but blamed it on the torrid afternoon heat . Pasta , Italy 's national dish , is recommended by sports doctors for building stamina . Marathon runners sometimes use a concentrated diet of pasta or rice for `` carbohydrate loading '' before competition .
