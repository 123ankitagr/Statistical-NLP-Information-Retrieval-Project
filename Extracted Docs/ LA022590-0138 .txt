El Camino College could have stayed home and cruised through its first-round playoff game against a 16-15 Riverside team . Instead , a last-minute change in the seedings made 23rd-seeded El Camino ( 21-10 ) have to play its game of the season to post an 81-79 upset of 10th-seeded Santa Monica ( 26-9 ) in front of a small but rowdy Westside crowd . `` We finally beat another quality team , '' said El Camino Coach Ron McClurkin , whose team finished in a three-way tie for third in the South Coast Conference . Santa Monica Coach John McMullen would not comment except to say he was happy to play a tougher team in the first round . Originally Santa Monica was to play Long Beach ( 15-15 ) . McMullen 's team played well , but the Warriors were clearly hungry for a win . Five El Camino players scored in double figures , and the team played fierce defense . Sophomore guard Larry Lockley led the Warriors with 21 points , and forward David Keeter had 13 before fouling out of the game with 11:48 remaining . Frank Beatty also had 13 points , and Steve Leary and Keith Brown scored 12 and 11 respectively . El Camino took a 44-40 halftime edge on Lockley 's baseline jumper at the buzzer . The Warriors benefited from the early ejection of Santa Monica freshman point guard Chico Langston , who threw a punch at El Camino guard Allen Caveness . The Warriors kept the lead until midway through the second half , when Santa Monica 's Jason Shea hit a three-pointer to put the Corsairs ahead , 61-60 . El Camino tied the score at 64-64 with 8:35 remaining and regained the lead on two Steven Leary free throws with 6:30 left . El Camino advances Wednesday to play L.A. City College , which defeated Mira Costa , 81-72 , on Saturday .
