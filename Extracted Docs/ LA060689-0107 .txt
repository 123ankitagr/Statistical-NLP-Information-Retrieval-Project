Two Insurance Firms Barred From State : Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie has ordered two Illinois insurers to stop doing business in California . Following a financial review , the Department of Insurance alleges that both companies , Mead Reinsurance and Amalgamated Labor Life , are threatened with insolvency . Department adjustments to Mead 's financial reserves show a negative policyholder surplus of more than $ 47 million , with further estimated reserve shortages from $ 50 to $ 100 million . The Department order against Amalgamated Labor Life follows action by the state of Illinois in May placing the company under a notice of impairment . A financial review by Illinois regulators reduced a reported $ 3 million policyholder surplus to a negative $ 2 million .
