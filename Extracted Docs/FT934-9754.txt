CSR , the large Australian building materials company , is to invest ADollars 29m ( USDollars 19m ) in a concrete products joint venture in Taiwan , bringing its total investment there to ADollars 50m . The Sydney-based group has also signed a 'strategic business alliance ' with the Taiwanese government , aimed at upgrading the technical capabilities of Taiwan 's building industry and , from CSR 's point of view , developing Taiwan as a 'base to pursue opportunities in building and construction materials in Asia ' . CSR claimed to be the first Australian company to sign such an agreement , although it noted that a number of large US corporations , such as AT & T , General Motors and General Electric , had done so . CSR first established a presence in Taipei last year , 'to co-ordinate building materials expansion' in northern Asia . The joint venture company , CSR Taiwan Humes , will be 75 per cent-owned by CSR and 25 per cent by Yung Ming Precast , which makes concrete pipes and pre-cast concrete products . It plans to build a concrete products factory in Taiwan , which will come into production by the end of 1994 . CSR said it expected the plant to put particular emphasis on producing PVC sheet-lined pre-cast concrete pipe and tunnel lining segments , for use in water and sewerage infrastructure projects .
