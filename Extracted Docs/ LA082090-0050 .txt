the times pop music critic begins his review of country music star george strait's aug 12 greek theatre concert with the words how embarrassing how embarrassing yes embarrassing for robert hilburn hilburn was generous enough to concede that only about 10 country artists in history have had more no 1 singles and the standing ovation when strait walked on stage at the sold-out greek testified to his acceptance acceptance a better word would be adoration as exemplified by strait's recent hit single love without end amen which tied billboard's all-time record by holding the no 1 spot on the singles charts for five consecutive weeks in his review hilburn attributes george strait's success to today's undemanding market undemanding nothing like having a pop music expert patronizing country music fans and the music they love country music is healthier than ever and it's not like the urban cowboy fad which was fueled by the movie and was something of a hula-hoop this new explosion is based on great artists and great music after admitting that strait did country music a service in the 80 s by helping refocus attention on the music's classic values and away from the slick pop emphasis of the 70 s hilburn announces that now this rich american music form is in need of a creative jump-start hilburn should take some time and listen closely to the music of the new and established country artists on the scene today then i'm confident he would hear all of the creativity that millions of country music fans are presently enjoying to this end i am sending a collection of cds to him as recommended listening also i am repeating my standing invitation of four years ago for him to attend the annual harlin howard birthday bash in nashville on sept 6 what more can i say when even one member of a choir is out of tune the least one can do is suggest a tuning fork see letters to counterpunch f4
