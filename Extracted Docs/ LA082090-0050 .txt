The Times ' pop music critic begins his review of country music star George Strait 's Aug. 12 Greek Theatre concert with the words `` how embarrassing . '' How embarrassing , yes . Embarrassing for Robert Hilburn . Hilburn was `` generous '' enough to concede that `` only about 10 country artists in history have had more No . 1 singles , and the standing ovation when Strait walked on stage at the sold-out Greek testified to his acceptance . '' Acceptance ? A better word would be adoration , as exemplified by Strait 's recent hit single , `` Love Without End , Amen , '' which tied Billboard 's all-time record by holding the No . 1 spot on the singles charts for five consecutive weeks . In his review , Hilburn attributes George Strait 's success to `` today 's undemanding market . '' Undemanding ? Nothing like having a `` pop music expert '' patronizing country music fans and the music they love . Country music is healthier than ever , and it 's not like the `` Urban Cowboy '' fad , which was fueled by the movie , and was something of a Hula-Hoop . This new explosion is based on great artists and great music . After admitting that `` Strait did country music a service in the '80s by helping refocus attention on the music 's classic values and away from the slick pop emphasis of the '70s , '' Hilburn announces that now `` this rich American music form is in need of a creative jump-start . '' Hilburn should take some time and listen closely to the music of the new and established country artists on the scene today . Then , I 'm confident he would hear all of the creativity that millions of country music fans are presently enjoying . To this end , I am sending a collection of CDs to him as recommended listening . Also , I am repeating my standing invitation of four years ago for him to attend the annual Harlin Howard `` Birthday Bash '' in Nashville on Sept. 6 . What more can I say ? When even one member of a choir is out of tune , the least one can do is suggest a tuning fork . See letters to Counterpunch , F4 .
