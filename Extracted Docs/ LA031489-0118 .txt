nothing to wear no cause for alarm the western costume co of hollywood the vanguard of authentic movie costumes outfitted the soldiers with uniforms before they set off to guard the states bridges and other vital installations western costume the film industrys oldest and largest costume maker and supplier with an estimated 15 million pieces in stock remains the major outfitter for film and television today fears among costume designers that it might be dismantled ended last week when paramount pictures corp sold western costume for an undisclosed price to three private investors who promised to keep the company operational the sixstory concrete stronghold that houses the costume company looms on an 85000squarefoot lot adjacent to and directly east of paramount studios on melrose

studios that shared ownership universal warner bros fox and columbia our intention from day one was to sell the business the property will be used to expand paramounts operations in a heavily congested part of the city where there is limited room for growth although it has not yet been determined exactly what the studio will do with the property lestz said paramount could have sold western

a museum the shareholders expect to be out of the present facility in the next six months they are considering new locations in hollywood and burbank western costume began simply enough in 1912 when a trader of american indian goods named l l burns wandered into los angeles loaded down with indian costumes and tales of the wild west the motion picture industry was in the earliest stages of development when burns chanced to meet william s hart the steelyeyed solemnfaced hero of dozens of silent westerns burns told the cowboy star how flagrantly inaccurate the costumes worn by his indian extras were at which point hart invited burns to become the exclusive supplier of indian clothing for his future pictures shortly after burns began raiding smaller studios and production companies to augment his inventory with a more comprehensive stock although most of the major studios maintained their own wardrobe departments western costume flourished by continuing to manufacture and stockpile its arsenal of costumes over the years the company produced colorful and elaborate garb for spectacles such as king kong 1933 cecille b demilles cleopatra 1934 the wizard of oz 1939 the king and i 1956 and spartacus 1960 western set the standard for magnificent costumes for the whole industry said elois jennsen oscarwinning costume designer for samson and delilah 1949 and former president of the costume designers guild ive always felt you can do the most beautiful sketch in the world but its the cutter and fitter and tailor who breathe life into it that makes the difference today western costume boasts that it can fill a 6 pm request to provide 1000 indian costumes complete with headdresses and tomahawks for a 9 am call the next day the interior of the companys imposing cement structure is a treasure chest filled with rare and exotic fabrics laces beads and trim factory rooms provide a workplace for scores of dressmakers and tailors who daily manufacture custommade costumes shoes hats jewelry and leather goods an exhaustive library of more than 12000 books and magazines is located on the premises in order to assure the medals that adorn the chest of a prussian generals costume are placed in just the right order or that the proper silk is used in the robe of a 12thcentury chinese coolie but clearly most impressive are the costume racks endless rows and corridors of musty wardrobes and articles of clothing originals and replicas from every period in history dating back to the dawn of man you have to remember that everything in a movie is visual and costumes are one of the things people see first and remember most said abramowitz president of ahs trinity group and the new president of western costume from one point of view this is hollywood there are some who feel that western costumes luster and glory faded with the studio system the lavish epics of hollywoods golden age have been largely replaced by more moderate timely films about contemporary society as a result an increasing number of movie costumes are being bought directly off store racks or created by fashion designers such as nolan miller bob mackey and bill hargate it used to be that every costume that appeared in a movie was custommade for the star with their name the studio and the slated production on the label said bill thomas a los angeles costumer collector and dealer now all i look at are store labels when i acquire wardrobes arnold schwarzeneggers futuristic leather jacket in the terminator was really a storebought bates motorcycle jacket out of 700 garments i acquire ill find maybe five that still have studio labels thomas claims to have purchased a number of bargains over the years from western costume in quietly held pound sales where buyers pay for loads of costumes by the pound a year and a half ago he landed one of the original toreador suits worn by tyrone power in the mark of zorro 1940 abramowitz stated firmly that such sales will not be continued under the new ownership the investment group expressed concern over the increasing amount of hollywood history and memorabilia that is being bought by foreign investors and shipped overseas ahs trinity has already budgeted $ 1 million to acquire new costumes including a modern collection and refurbish existing stock the reasons our group became involved are simple haber said i want the historical value and research collection to be available to the generations that follow me and i want to show a sign that there are certain important institutions in this industry that we should attempt to keep together in america
