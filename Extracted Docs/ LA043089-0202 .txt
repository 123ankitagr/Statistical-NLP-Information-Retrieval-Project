on june 2 1925 wally pipp had a headache and was replaced at first base in the new york yankee lineup by a quiet hometown kid named lou gehrig it took 14 years 2130 games and an incurable illness to put gehrig back on the bench and when the iron horse took himself out of the lineup 50 years ago on may 2 1939 he also moved out of the shadow of babe ruth and into baseball immortality the shy son of german immigrants living on new yorks east side never captured the imagination of the public the way the flamboyant ruth did but when his remarkable consecutivegame streak ended he took with him numbers comparable to anyone who ever played the game 493 lifetime homers 1990 rbis a 632 slugging percentage a majorleague record 23 grand slams four home runs in a game in 1927 he hit 373 with 47 home runs and 175 runs batted in he also had 52 doubles 18 triples walked 109 times and scored 149 runs yet it was a season lost to ruths 60 home runs in the 13 full seasons he played gehrig averaged 147 rbis a season henry aaron willie mays and mickey mantle never drove in that many runs in a seeason even once in four seasons during the peak of his career he averaged only 37 strikeouts a year reggie jackson averaged 129 strikeouts a season for his career but it is his 2130 consecutive games played that is considered one of baseballs unbreakable records the next best is the mark gehrig broke 1307 straight games by everett scott 823 games more than five seasons short of gehrigs mark if a rookie was to start a consecutivegame streak in 1989 he would have to play every game from now until early in the season of 2002 to surpass gehrig since 1939 no one has even come close steve garvey holds the national league record with 1207 consecutive games from sept 3 1975 to july 29 1983 garvey retired after the 1987 season but if he had kept the streak going in 1983 and was playing today he would still be a few games short i dont think anyone will ever break lou gehrigs record garvey said i know i played with a lot of nagging injuries to keep the streak alive and i didnt even get close baltimore shortstop cal ripken recently surpassed playing in 1100 consecutive games he would still need another sixplus seasons to reach gehrig its not really something im thinking about ripken said i cant even imagine reaching that point hey im surprised ive gotten this far i just play one game at a time a star at columbia university gehrig was scouted by paul krichell and signed with the yankees when offered a $ 1500 bonus after two short stints with new york in 1923 and 1924 gehrig started his streak on that june day in 1925 when pipp who had been the yankees first baseman since 1915 told manager miller huggins he had a headache and asked to take the day off gehrig took over at first base and stayed there for 15 years he stayed through muscle pulls broken bones and yes even a slump or two gehrig turned 35 in 1938 and his average slipped to 295 with 29 homers and 114 rbis while milliondollar numbers by todays standards it was far below his norm and provoked concern for gehrig and the yankees gehrig whose top salary was $ 39000 had a sluggish spring training in 1939 and a routine play at yankee stadium in april told him something was wrong a ball was hit back to pitcher johnny murphy and gehrig had trouble getting to the bag murphy told the iron horse nice play but gehrig knew it was nothing special in his first 28 atbats in 1939 gehrig had four hits with no homers and one rbi gehrig knew something was wrong he just didnt know what may 1 1939 was an off day and gehrig spent some lonely hours in a detroit hotel room the next day gehrig told manager joe mccarthy im taking myself out of the lineup i decided last sunday night on this move gehrig said in announcing his decision to the press i havent been a bit of good to the team since the season started it would not be fair to the boys to joe or to the baseball public for me to try going on in fact it would not be fair to myself mccarthy thought gehrig just needed some much deserved time off and would be back soon i told him it would be as he wished mccarthy said at the time like everybody else im sorry to see it happen i told him not to worry maybe the warm weather will bring him around but the weather had nothing to do with gehrigs problems he visited the mayo clinic in minnesota and it was discovered he had an incurable disease he was diagnosed as having amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but the world has come to know it as lou gehrigs disease i was there said former yankees broadcaster mel allen but sometimes it doesnt seem real now there was a real lou gehrig a guy who joked with his teammates and argued at bad calls but after his last game he became a legend others have had great numbers but few more impact on the game of baseball i remember the first time i played first base at yankee stadium thinking i was in the same place lou gehrig played first baseman don mattingly said it almost gave me chills yankee stadium is the house that ruth built but as long as a team plays there gehrig will be the pride of the yankees said allen hes what made wearing a yankee uniform special
