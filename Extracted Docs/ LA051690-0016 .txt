There can be no place but Stanford where the text of `` Uncle Tom 's Cabin '' is pored over so seriously . It was a trash novel in its day , written by a housewife who never set foot in the South . It is a device for the study of Western culture just as `` Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles '' is a device for the study of animal biology . If the privileged children of Stanford must immerse themselves in the doings of Little Eva , Topsy , and company , let it be as an artifact of the Civil War era . Do n't put it on the shelf next to Plato and the Bible . RICHARD HEALEY Huntington Beach
