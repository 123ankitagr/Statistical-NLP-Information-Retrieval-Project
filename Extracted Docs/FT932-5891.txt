Mercury is shortly to launch its 'one-2-one ' mobile phone service to consumers within the M25 . Its restricted geographical coverage means that few existing mobile phone users are likely to move over in the early stages . But its lower call charges may well attract a new market of London-based domestic and small business users . To hook these customers , however , mobile handsets will have to be competitively priced and call quality will have to be acceptable to customers used to crystal-clear land lines . Even if one-2-one does find a solid market , it will cost Mercury dearly in the first few years . Heavy capital expenditure will be needed to expand the network throughout the south-east , and Mercury is having to subsidise the price of the new-technology handsets by around Pounds 150 a time . So attracting 200,000 subscribers in its first two years could cost Mercury Pounds 30m . Yet a large base of subscribers will be vital : the one-2-one network will cost more than twice that of a conventional cellular system to establish , while call charges will be lower . One-2-one 's advantage is that it gives Mercury another front in the war to attack BT 's customer base . That counts because rolling out cable television is slow and Mercury has almost reached saturation within the City of London . AT & T also wants to attack the City . Mercury will have to spend more on marketing to attract lower-value customers elsewhere . With Vodafone also close to launching a new cellular service , telecoms competition is beginning to warm up .
