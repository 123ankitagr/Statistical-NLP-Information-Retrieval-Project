a senior us diplomat arrived in pyongyang yesterday to seek the release of a us army pilot whose detention by north korea threatens its recent nuclear agreement with washington the visit by mr thomas hubbard a deputy assistant secretary of state follows that of a us congressman who last week helped to arrange the return of the body of the pilot's colleague killed in the crash of their helicopter in north korea north korea has said that it has delayed the repatriation of the captured pilot chief warrant officer bobby hall because he has not co-operated in its investigation of the straying of the oh-58 reconnaissance helicopter into its airspace pyongyang claims the helicopter was on a spying mission and the north has demanded an acknowledgement of guilt and an apology from the us last night north korea said the pilot had confessed to intruding deep into its territory on a reconnaissance mission and had asked for forgiveness the official news agency quoted hall as saying i admit that this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable however at home my parents wife and kids are anxiously waiting for my return washington said the helicopter flew into north korea because of a navigational error analysts believe other reasons may account for north korea's reluctance to release the pilot one possibility is that north korea is trying to exploit the incident to gain new concessions from the us pyongyang has been pressing washington to sign a peace treaty that would formally end the korean war of 1950-53 in the hope that this would eventually lead to the withdrawal of the 37,000 us troops in south korea north korea could argue that the helicopter incident underscores the need for such a peace treaty it may also try to use the incident as a means to force the us to accelerate the establishment of diplomatic ties with pyongyang as promised under the bilateral nuclear accord concluded in october the us also agreed to guarantee international aid including the supply of safer light-water reactors if north korea dismantled its current nuclear programme which is suspected of producing weapons-grade plutonium however such a diplomatic strategy carries risks for north korea since us congressional critics of the nuclear agreement may use the continued detention of the pilot as a reason to block the deal us critics of the accord believe that it offers too many concessions to north korea senator bob dole who is soon to become us senate majority leader was quoted yesterday as calling the agreement a lousy deal and adding you can't trust the north koreans mr lee hamilton outgoing chairman of the us house of representatives foreign relations committee said i don't think we'd proceed with our side of the nuclear accord if they don't release the airman even so the delay may also reflect deep divisions between north korea leaders over the nuclear agreement some south korean officials believe that the northern military is at odds with its government over whether to proceed with the agreement
