Sir , Your story referring to the negative worth of some of the world's leading brand names ( 'IBM plunges to bottom of brand name value league ' , July 11 ) is misleading as regards Del Monte . The company referred to in the article is Del Monte Corporation in the US . Del Monte Foods International , based in the UK , is completely independent from the US company . Since 1992 , the Del Monte brand name in the UK , Europe , Middle East and Africa has been licensed to the Del Monte Royal Group of Companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange .
