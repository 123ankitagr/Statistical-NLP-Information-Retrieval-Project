a yearlong construction moratorium in burbank imposed to give the city time to develop new building restrictions came to an end this week but few developers have submitted plans for new projects because the city council is still haggling over new rules city planner rick pruetz said that although a moratorium on issuance of new permits for construction of apartment buildings expired wednesday the city has received fewer than half a dozen proposals for new projects before the moratorium the city received about 150 building plans per year pruetz said some developers are reluctant to propose new projects because the city building guidelines are still being revised after voters approved a ballot initiative calling for growth controls last year the city council imposed the construction moratorium so it could write new building guidelines council members are considering imposing a developers fee to help pay for the city services required by the additional residents brought to the city by new housing many developers would rather wait until the fee proposal is complete before submitting building plans pruetz said
