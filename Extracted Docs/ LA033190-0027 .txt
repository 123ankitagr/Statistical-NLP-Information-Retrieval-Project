A yearlong construction moratorium in Burbank , imposed to give the city time to develop new building restrictions , came to an end this week , but few developers have submitted plans for new projects because the City Council is still haggling over new rules . City Planner Rick Pruetz said that although a moratorium on issuance of new permits for construction of apartment buildings expired Wednesday , the city has received fewer than half a dozen proposals for new projects . Before the moratorium , the city received about 150 building plans per year . Pruetz said some developers are reluctant to propose new projects because the city building guidelines are still being revised . After voters approved a ballot initiative calling for growth controls last year , the City Council imposed the construction moratorium so it could write new building guidelines . Council members are considering imposing a developers fee to help pay for the city services required by the additional residents brought to the city by new housing . Many developers would rather wait until the fee proposal is complete before submitting building plans , Pruetz said .
