for years i have been reading how our environmentalists have been prodding brazil and other third world countries to save the rain forests because of the damaging effect this destruction would have on global climate to say nothing of air for breathing yet we have a constant battle to preserve our national parks as well as our coastlines regarding oil from exploitation isnt our country strong enough to afford these luxuries what are we going to leave for our descendants bare bones and ravaged earth and if we are ever in such desperate straits that were forced to use them they will still be there if we use them up now what then if lumber companies want trees why do they not plant them if they had done this in the past there would have been plenty available and it is not too late to start now apologies to any company which has been doing this sam baron inglewood
