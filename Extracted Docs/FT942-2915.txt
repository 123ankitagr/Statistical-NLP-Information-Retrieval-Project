the korean peninsula is a political powder keg that has caused three regional wars since 1894 when china and japan clashed over the country the question is whether the north korean nuclear dispute will cause a fourth conflict whether the crisis can be resolved peacefully depends largely on north koreas intentions in refusing international inspections of its nuclear facilties the most optimistic interpretation has been that it was seeking concessions from the us in return for allowing full inspections yesterday former us president jimmy carter said the north koreans had agreed to allow inspectors to remain at its nuclear plant a statement welcomed cautiously by washington a deal perhaps brokered by mr carter could head off confrontation but the price demanded is likely to be steep pyongyang wants us diplomatic recognition economic aid including the supply of safer lightwater nuclear reactors and the eventual withdrawal of the 37000 us troops from south korea the latter would be linked to a peace treaty between north korea and us that would formally end the korean war of 195053 in return for diplomatic normalisation the us is also likely to demand conditions that north korea may find unacceptable including improvements in human rights and ending its exports of longrange missiles another thorny issue is whether the us would permit north korea to retain the two nuclear weapons it is already suspected of possessing as long as nuclear safeguards would prevent it from making any more that issue could be solved if full inspections disclose that the north has not yet succeeded in constructing atomic bombs there are other obstacles to a diplomatic solution negotiations could easily founder due to mutual distrust any negotiations would also be lengthy this presents a political problem for president bill clinton already criticised by domestic conservative opponents for being too patient granting diplomatic recognition to north korea would also open mr clinton to charges that he has bowed to nuclear blackmail although he has established a precedent by giving economic aid to ukraine in return for dismantling its nuclear forces us concessions to north korea would also be likely to anger south korea and provoke doubts about a us commitment to its defence this could force seoul to quit the us nuclear umbrella and try to acquire its own nuclear weapons capability north korea has engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship since the nuclear dispute erupted in march 1993 when it threatened to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty there is a growing belief in washington and seoul that north korea is just playing for time as it pushes ahead to build more nuclear weapons the worstcase scenario is that north korea plans to sell both weaponsgrade plutonium and missiles to other antiwestern nations such as iran and libya in return for hard currency and oil supplies keep its struggling economy afloat although us economic aid might remove the need for weapons sales pyongyang would prefer not to become economically dependent on the us according to this analysis if despite yesterdays encouraging signals north korea does not appear willing to compromise within the next few weeks the un security council would begin introducing phased sanctions these would start with mild measures such as ending un economic aid and gradually escalating to an oil embargo and cutoff of cash remittances from koreanjapanese but china may try to block sanctions even if beijing allows the passage through the united nations of phased sanctions it may try to cushion their effect on north korea by turning a blind eye to continued supplies of oil and grain which are vital to pyongyang china has a vested interest in preventing north korea from collapsing since it wants to avoid millions of refugees streaming across its borders there is little doubt that un sanctions would cause north korea to withdraw from the npt which would deepen the dispute pyongyang has said it would consider sanctions an act of war implying it would launch an attack against possibly south korea or japan officials in seoul believe the threat is a bluff to intimidate south korea and japan from supporting sanctions and that north korea realises it would lose any war but terrorist activity is not ruled out if economic sanctions are introduced the us and its japanese and south korean allies might then adopt a waitandsee attitude hoping the economic measures would lead to north koreas eventual collapse another possibility is that the chineseinfluenced north korean military might stage a coup against the countrys next leader mr kim jongil once his father the 82yearold president kim ilsung dies there is believed to be considerable military opposition to kim junior but there are certain time constraints to waiting north korea is on the brink of rapidly expanding its nuclear capability while it now operates only a 5mw reactor it is expected to complete building a 50mw reactor in 1995 and a 200mw one in 1998 that could produce amounts of plutonium the us might consequently consider conducting a preemptive military air strike to knock out the two bigger reactors before they are finished but this action carries grave risks it would be likely to trigger a desperate military invasion of south korea by the north pyongyang might also launch scud missiles against the souths 12 commercial nuclear reactors in retaliation which would spread radioactivity clouds throughout the region for this reason the us is unlikely to find much support for a military solution from south korea and japan
