the bundesbank has been miserly with interest rates for so long that yesterdays generous cut in the repurchase rate comes as something of a shock the quarterpoint reduction in the discount rate a fortnight ago has already been reflected in money market rates this is especially surprising given the improving economic outlook there are still risks but german government forecasts of 15 per cent growth this year no longer look overoptimistic still the bundesbank has a record of cutting interest rates after the economy has turned as it did in 198283 inflation is widely expected to fall this year so real rates would rise without further action most independent growth forecasts have been nudged higher in anticipation of a strong export performance which should not rekindle inflation while output remains well below trend with m3 growth running at 15 per cent in march money supply poses the only credible inflationary threat this gives the bundesbank a strong argument for caution on the pace of interest rate reductions the explanation for its recent spurt may lie with the foreign exchange markets the weakness of the dollar this year has meant an effective tightening for germany especially if exporters are expected to drive recovery the bundesbank may also be trying to relieve pressure on the french franc even allowing for its delight in wrongfooting financial markets though an official rate cut following todays council meeting looks unlikely
