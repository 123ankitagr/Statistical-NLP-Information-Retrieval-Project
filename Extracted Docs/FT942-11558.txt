At last it has become clear why Tony Cockerill , the former deputy director who has been in charge of Manchester Business School for the past two years , did not want his contract renewed after July . He has other plans - including going off to be director of Durham University Business School from October this year . The Manchester school was more than a little coy about Cockerill 's future , when it announced two weeks ago that it was looking urgently for a new head . It then gave the clear impression that Cockerill might stay on in some subordinate role . That possibility is now scotched , with the news he is in fact defecting across the Pennines to a smaller and somewhat aggressive rival . Cockerill , 52 , is an economist who has advised House of Commons select committees on nationalised industries , trade and industry , and Scottish affairs . He stepped into the breach at Manchester after Tom Cannon and his board of private sector advisers fell out with the university over autonomy and left en masse .
