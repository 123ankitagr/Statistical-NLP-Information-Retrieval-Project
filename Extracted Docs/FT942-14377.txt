the skies are darkening for firstclass air travel dutch carrier klm and northwest airlines of the us have become the latest airlines to abolish first class cabins in favour of upgraded business ones on longhaul flights flagging customer demand prompted in part by the economic downturn but also by the upgraded facilities being introduced in the business class sector have led nearly all the international airlines to review their first class operations in the past two years not all that many have survived luxury travel has been increasingly passed over by costconscious travellers with many big companies ordering their staff to book cheaper seats as the recession has taken hold the empty rows in first class have prompted many airlines to create a middle class and within that tier further differentiation by refurbishing their existing business facilities the effect has been a downward ratchet with many former first class travellers unlikely to return and a generation of prospective customers satisfied in the cheaper business tier for many airlines a 5 per cent full paying passenger load has become the norm in first class with the remaining seats filled by travelling airline crew or by upgrading business class passengers with the quality gap closing between the middle and top tiers the hefty chasm between the respective fares looks all the more glaring a first class ticket between chicago and glasgow will cost in the region of pounds 4500 whereas a business class fare comes in at around pounds 2500 with economy at about pounds 900 however the move away from first class travel is not simply a recent one the recession has accentuated a trend begun in the 1980s when attempts to identify business travellers through a new range of branded products began to pay dividend for airlines as the range of brands proliferated so too did the fragmentation of the market with first class pushed into an ever smaller niche the first casualty were shorthaul flights with passengers rejecting the luxuries and cost of first class for regional journeys last year swissair became the last of the big airlines to offer a cheaper alternative to its shorthaul first class travel but it was the recession which sounded the death knell for first class with airlines plunging into losses throughout the world the luxury services proved the most costly to keep running and consequently the ones to receive the severest cuts there was hardly any demand says klm business travellers want the luxuries of first class but at a business class fare thats what were going to give them klm and its us partner northwest airlines are abolishing their first class tier and will offer passengers a choice between economy and a premium service called world business class an upgraded version of the old business class service the main feature of the new service will be increased leg room the only airlines offering more room to business class passengers will be those that have already abolished first class travel virgin atlantic of the uk and continental airlines of the us british airways is one of the few airlines to maintain a significant presence in first class although ironically it was the first to close down its shorthaul capacity mr mike batt bas marketing director believes the problem for most airlines is threefold an airline has to maintain a good load factor to make first class economical and for that it needs a good route network few airlines have got the presence secondly you need a strong branded product which customers can trust for integrity and consistency and most of all you have to be able to deliver that product for ba integrity means few upgrades from business class upgrading devalues the product says mr batt so what do customers get for first class not available on other airlines premium brands the lines of differentiation are getting increasingly blurred executive lounges extended leg room wider chairs and personal video are all offered in different measure by the premium services and at a cheaper price mr batt admits that first class is matched in many regards by other premium services but argues that the total travel experience offered by the doyen of air services is worth the extra expense the first class traveller is someone who because he is travelling a lot needs more than anyone to relax while he is doing it if we can deliver a busy executive overnight to a meeting the next day in a refreshed and healthy state ready to do business then first class travel is a wholly justifiable business expense first class makes up around 4 per cent of british airways revenue and mr batt believes that the move by other airlines away from the brand will draw other passengers over to ba there is a small but significant band of regular travellers who are loyal to first class and do not want to fly anything else a typical ba 747 will contain around 300 economy class seats 7288 club class and 18 or so first class other airlines with first class on their 747s are likely to offer far fewer seats even so they have been finding few takers and special deals proliferate such as free second tickets for spouses and discounts on future flights furthermore plans being drawn up for the new generation of 777 aircraft make no allowances for first class cabins but ba intends to keep its first class product at the forefront of executive travel later this year it plans to introduce its first aircraft to allow first class passengers to send faxes operate computers receive email and make outgoing telephone calls all our research indicates that our customers do not want incoming calls says mr batt however even bullish ba admits the future for first class is not guaranteed if the niche got too small then we would have to look at our options says mr batt you have to be responsive and we will change with the market
