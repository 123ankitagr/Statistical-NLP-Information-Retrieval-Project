An appeals court Thursday delayed the trial of a suspected serial robber who is charged with holding up cashiers in stores throughout the county . The 4th District Court of Appeal delayed the trial of Paul William Bresney , 38 , of San Diego so it can review a ruling by the trial judge before the trial gets under way . Deputy Dist . Atty . Kerry Wells filed a writ with the appellate court after San Diego Superior Court Judge J. Perry Langford on Wednesday split up the 56 charges against Bresney and ordered four separate trials . Langford ruled that Bresney be tried for 15 counts each at three trials , and then for 11 counts at the last trial . Bresney 's lawyer , Charles Elliott , had successfully argued that bunching all of the cases together in one trial would be prejudicial to Bresney . Bresney is accused of being the `` Walk to the Back '' robber , who told his victims to go the back of the store he was holding up while he made his getaway . The robberies began Jan. 3 and continued into April . Bresney was arrested April 21 . The order halting the trial came just as potential jurors were called to the courtroom . The appellate justices are expected to review Langford 's decision and make a ruling within a few weeks .
