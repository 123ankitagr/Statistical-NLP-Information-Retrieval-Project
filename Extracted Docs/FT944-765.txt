the international benchmark prices for 1995 iron ore deliveries settled by bhp in japan on wednesday go some way to make up the drop suffered by miners this year the reaction of bhps fellow suppliers however has been less than enthusiastic the details are that iron ore fines prices on an fob basis will rise by 58 per cent for deliveries to japan from april l next year the new bhp fines price is 2715 cents for each 1 per cent of pure fe content or per dry long ton unit the new lump ore price of 33 cents a lont ton unit represents an increase of 79 per cent and gives bhp a rough overall price rise for its japanese deliveries of 69 per cent most miners had been hoping for the fines price to rise by a high singledigit percentage bhp ranks as the second largest australian iron ore supplier to japan after cpas hamersley iron in 1994 its japanese shipments are likely to total about 11m tonnes 800000 tonnes higher than the minimum it contracted to supply during 1994 its minimum contractual tonnage in the 1995 fiscal year will be 136m tonnes by settling before hamersley bhp regained some of the clout as an iron ore supplier that it lost when a wall collapsed at its mt whaleback mine in 1989 and the company had to declare force majeure the settlement also established a new record premium in japan for lump over fines of 874 cents lump ore makes up just over half of bhps japanese deliveries to many in the ore trade however the fact that bhp has recently been supplying more than its minimum obligation in what is supposed to be a disastrous financial year for the japanese mills indicates that the suppliers could have got higher prices it is true that japanese steel milis have been heavily lossmaking until very recently but there are undeniable signs of recovery japanese crude steel output in november was 15 per cent higher than in november 1993 in the latter half of 1994 iron ore consumers especially in europe have been concerned about running short of higher grade lump and pellet unlike fines these grades are directly chargeable to the blast furnace and do not require sintering european steelmakers especially in benelux and scandinavia are closing their sinter plants for environmental reasons adding to the pressure on directcharge ores steelmakers which in europe and japan tend not to have direct stakes in iron ore mines are often accused of ignoring the necessity of allowing miners a reasonable return on investment in the economically sluggish years since 1990 iron ore prices have fallen miners are nowadays frequently heard to say that prices are returns are insufficient to justify the expansions or developments of new capacity needed to ensure healthy supply in the future analysts believe supplies of lump and pellet will be tight throughout 1995 with fines remaining in balance investment may not be taking place in large greenfield mine developments but there have been just about enough expansions or capacity replacements to cover shortterm consumption hamersleys new marandoo mine in western australia and the mhaoudat mine in mauritania are among the most significant such developments this year chinas continuing hunger for imported iron ore was witnessed in the opening by portman mining of a new joint venture mine at koolyanobbing in western australia dedicated entirely to supplying china in addition venezuelas cvg opened a 3mtonnesayear pelletising plant last month in april 1995 lkab of sweden plans to inaugurate its 4mtonne pelletiser at kiruna until ore prices improve sufficiently to allow largescale investment for the blast furnace market the ore industrys attention will be focused on developing directcharge products for the direct reduced iron sector dri is the fastest growing area in iron making because the various dr technologies are beginning to prove themselves as viable alternatives to traditional blast furnacebased steelworks smaller scale cleaner plants can be built at a fraction of the cost of the traditional works already this year the leading us minimill nucor corp has opened the worlds first iron carbide plant in trinidad bhp is also on the point of approving the construction of an exportoriented hot briquetted iron plant in western australia india has built a 5mtonnesayear dri industry in the last few years further investments in dri have been announced in south korea venezuela and bahrain the volume of iron ore consumed in dr iron making is still small compared with the blast furnace sector the total seaborne trade in iron ore this year has been estimated at 368m tonnes annual world production of dri has only just topped 25m tonnes but the demand for drgrade ores is likely to double in the next few years prices for drgrade ores look set to outstrip those in the blast furnace sector the fact that scrap consuming minimills such as nucor which are the fastest growing steelmakers in the world are themselves beginning to invest in the new iron making processes spells hope for the iron ore industry in the long term bob jones is a deputy editor of metal bulletin magazine
