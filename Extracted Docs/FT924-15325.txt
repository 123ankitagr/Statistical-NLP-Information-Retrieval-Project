five times as many people hang up when they phone a friend and get an answering machine than when a business call is answered by a machine according to a recent survey carried out by systems reliability a uk telecoms company despite their antipathy to answering machines more than two thirds of the sample said they owned one the latest models offer solid-state recording which means callers messages are recorded directly onto a chip instead of a tape there are no moving parts to break down and there is no delay for the owner's greeting to be rewound after a caller has left a message however solid-state machines are not cheap audioline sells one for pounds 79.99 an equivalent machine without solid state costs pounds 20 less at the top of the range bt's falcon ii machine includes a handset hands-free talking and solid-state outgoing message for pounds 170 bt also sells some combined telephone and answering machines with two-way record which enable conversations to be recorded but the most basic machine from uk electrical retailer dixons costs less than pounds 30, and it is not unusual to find built-in answering machines on personal facsimile machines and cordless phones although 75 per cent of calls fail to reach their target answering machines are still fairly rare in the european business environment this is also true of voice messaging the corporate equivalent at their simplest voice mail systems allow callers to leave messages by dialing the appropriate voice mailbox number and a code users can play them back but most voice messaging systems can do much more for example once a caller has left a message it can be forwarded from the user to a colleague with instructions attached such as please sort out this customer's problem and get back to me voice messaging systems have taken off in the us partly because the touch-tone phones needed to operate them are in wider use but acceptance has been slow in the uk and continental europe the involvement of the uk cellular phone operators has started to change the picture cellnet and vodafone the two main uk service providers have both launched 24-hour voice messaging services these record all messages left when the mobile phone is switched off and then alert the user when the phone is back on as well as being a big moneyspinner they have helped to raise the profile of voice mail as a result research company bis mackintosh will shortly be revising upwards its public voice messaging forecasts it originally forecast uk network revenues of dollars 121.93 m for public messaging services this year and dollars 779.91 m in 1996 apart from the cellular operators leading players in the public voice mail market include mercury and bt bt also has a voice mail service for residential users on trial in-house or premises-based voice mail systems offer similar features to public services but they involve the one-off purchase of equipment costing in the region of pounds 10,000 for a 100 users public services on the other hand are pay-as-you go most of the premises-based voice mail-voice processing systems available in europe are based on north american products these were pioneered by companies such as octel sold by hewlett packard in the uk at t vmx sold by mercury in the uk northern telecom and centigram there are three main types of voice system voice messaging audiotex and voice processing audiotex is used for 0898 recorded information such as racing results weather information or airline flight times some systems can insert live information such as the results of the latest racing fixture into recorded information voice processing or interactive voice response is the type of technology used in telephone-based home banking systems it might for example prompt the user to press one to order a cheque book press two for your bank balance in essence these systems link a voice interface to a computer database they allow customers to input and retrieve information using a touch-tone phone the more advanced systems use speech recognition because of limitations in the technology many use voice synthesis to play back the customer's message for checking one system sold by us-based syntellect can recognise different languages there is an increasing amount of overlap between the different voice technologies for example parts of british rail are using systems reliability's orbi-link network for both voice mail to notify engineers of faults and voice processing to order parts and compile statistics on repair times the system can also be integrated with local area network-based electronic mail allowing users to add voice notes to text messages however the main driver in the premises-based voice systems market is integration with fax according to amanda jobbins of bis mackintosh this enables a customer to phone a supplier select a product and provide a fax number to which a price-list can be sent automatically and all without human intervention on the part of the supplier the day might come when customers hang up if they get a human on the line
