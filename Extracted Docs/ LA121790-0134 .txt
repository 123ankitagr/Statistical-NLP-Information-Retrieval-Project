Actress Kathy Baker says critics have been using the `` f '' word to describe her performance in the new movie `` Edward Scissorhands , '' and she could n't be happier . `` That 's ' f ' for funny , '' Baker said . `` This is my first screen comedy . Until now there was this attitude in Hollywood that Kathy Baker ca n't do comedy . '' In `` Scissorhands , '' Johnny Depp plays a creature built by Vincent Price who has blades instead of fingers . Baker 's predatory suburban housewife fails to seduce him , then claims he attacked her . Before `` Scissorhands , '' moviegoers saw her in such darker films as `` Jacknife '' with Robert De Niro , `` Clean and Sober '' with Michael Keaton and `` Dad '' with Ted Danson and Jack Lemmon . The National Society of Film Critics named her best supporting actress in 1987 for her role as a prostitute in `` Street Smart . '' She and her husband and two children have taken an apartment in Kansas City while she makes the movie `` Article 99 '' about a staff rebellion at a Veterans Administration hospital .
