US producer prices rose a modest 0.2 per cent in April , the Labour Department said yesterday in a report showing that the weak economic recovery is restraining price advances , Reuter reports from Washington . April 's rise in the producer price index matched 0.2 per cent advances in both March and February . The report generally supported financial analysts ' views that price pressures are under control and that the Federal Reserve , the US central bank , has room to lower interest rates without fanning inflation . During the first four months of the year , producer prices had risen by a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1 per cent , the department said . In 1991 , the PPI fell by 0.1 per cent .
