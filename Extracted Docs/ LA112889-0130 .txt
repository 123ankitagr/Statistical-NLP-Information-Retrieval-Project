somewhere in nashville there may well be a record promoter or marketing specialist who grimaces whenever k d lang's voice filters through the air the singing itself wouldn't be to blame for the sour look on the hypothetical country music insider's face that would be impossible since lang possesses one of the most confident presence-filled and unambiguously splendid voices in pop music today no the grimace and sideways head shake would come from the thought of how out-of-sync the woman behind the voice is with the country music image machinery and how much more money she might generate if she could only be made to fit a more readily salable mold if lang's voice came in a conventionally glamorous sweetheart-of-the rodeo package there is a strong possibility that country superstardom would be hers but instead of feminine cowgirl dresses flowing tresses and the other trappings usually associated with country divas lang favors an androgynous short-haired appearance closer to punk-influenced alternative-rock fashion than to nashville's idea of how a star attraction should look i'm sure nashville would want to see me go country lang who plays tuesday night at the celebrity theatre with her band the reclines said in a recent phone interview if i abided by their rules they're sure i could sell a lot of records they'd like to see me co-write with a nashville songwriter and have a contemporary nashville producer produce me in nashville they're very incestuous not that lang's music has been a commercial flop her current album absolute torch and twang had a solid run in the top 20 on the country album charts and it broke into the top 100 on the billboard pop album chart lang's music shows fealty to country's musical traditions with swinging honky-tonk stylings and spacious big-sky atmospherics full of sighing steel guitars but on a song like it's me from absolute torch and twang she uses country musical conventions to declare her independence from conventional nashville style might not be all you want but it's all you get it's me on them shiny pages all that hairdo it ain't me i'm not averse to the style of dolly parton but i have to be natural to myself to put the best art out that i can lang said if listeners don't accept the way i look they'll never understand the music totally image may be the most apparent way lang 28, differs from performers working comfortably within the country music system the differences that crop up in her music are subtler lang and the reclines first major-label album angel with a lariat had elements of kitsch and spoof in its rambunctious rock-flavored assault on country style still the excellence of the singing and playing made it obvious that the musicians also had serious regard for country music in 1988, lang answered any questions about how authentically interested she was in being a country singer by recording shadowland a tribute to the classic patsy cline sound in which she teamed with cline's original producer owen bradley with absolute torch and twang lang said i sort of marked my coming of age as a songwriter and an artist with her own direction being rid of the patsy cline obsession and coming into her own style hearing cline's music at the age of 20 had a near-mystical effect on lang who was raised in the tiny town of consort alberta performance art was lang's genre when she came across cline as a result of playing a country singer in a musical in edmonton cline's music struck her so deeply that lang began to entertain mystical thoughts that she and the late country star might be spiritually linked for the first time lang considered country music as a creative outlet i was a performance artist i was at totally the opposite end of the spectrum from country music for me to explain country to my art friends was kind of scary they said yeah you're going to make fun of it right i said yeah kind of but not totally i have this kitsch side of me but i also have respect for it with shadowland and now absolute torch and twang lang dispensed with the kitsch and positioned herself as an unabashed country singer but if lang seems comfortable enough now with country as a form to use it straightforwardly she also has an idea of how to work subtle changes that give it her own outsider's stamp some of her songs include touches of abstraction and unorthodox word placement self-consciously artful elements that depart from country's usual directness and colloquial conversational style in nowhere to stand a song about child abuse lang takes what would be a reverential catch phrase in most country songwriting a family tradition the strength of this land and twists it around to deeply ironic effect by labeling child-battering a family tradition the strength of this land lang obliquely calls into question the sentimental uncritical attitude that runs through much of the nashville establishment when it comes to the portrayal of traditional values from that conservative viewpoint such buzzwords as family tradition and strength of this land would represent something inviolable but lang's song makes the point that a tradition such as unchallenged parental authority can foster evil from generation to generation lang's mixture of reverence and restlessness for traditional country forms leaves it open as to where she will go next with her music we're six months into a one-year tour so i kind of have blinders on till the end of may she said i'd really like to be on broadway i'd love to do annie get your gun but i think my ultimate goal is to be established as a songwriter and be known for developing my own style as a singer lang said she handpicked her opening act ranch romance an unsigned all-female group from seattle that she describes as sort of like the roches meets sons of the pioneers they opened for me in seattle and i fell in love with their sound k d lang the reclines and ranch romance play tuesday at 7 30 p m at the celebrity theatre 201 e broadway in anaheim tickets 20 information 714 999-9536
