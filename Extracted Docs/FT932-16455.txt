TAXATION as a proportion of national income is set to rise this year to the highest level for four years , the free-market Adam Smith Institute says . The proportion will rise this year to 41.68 per cent from 39.43 per cent last year and 42.18 per cent in 1989 - itself the highest since 1985 when it was 42.35 per cent . It says the change is 'deeply disturbing ' - after the early 1980s , when tax as a proportion of national income fell , Britain 'is once more becoming a high tax economy ' .
