A feature film about a heterosexual doctor who re-examines his life after he tests positive for AIDS -- filmed in Orange County , financed by an Orange County doctor and directed by a graduate of Orange Coast College -- will , fittingly enough , have its premiere in the county . The producers of `` A Different Life '' are still looking for a distributor , but in the meantime they have booked the film into the Valley View Twin Cinemas in Garden Grove for a one-week run , today through Thursday . `` A Different Life '' is based on a story by physician Jay Amin about `` a heterosexual doctor who panics when he tests positive for AIDS . '' But as it turns out , the test results were faulty . Amin , who has practices in Santa Ana and Tustin , is also the movie 's executive producer . The film stars John Mansfield in the lead role , along with such film and TV veterans as Karen Black , Lyle Waggoner and Burt Ward . `` A Different Life '' marks the directing debut of Orange Coast College graduate Kent Blakely . Show times for the film are 5:30 , 7:30 and 9:15 p.m. ; Saturday and Sunday will add matinees at 11:30 a.m. , 1:30 and 3:30 p.m . The Theater is at 12111 Valley View St. , Garden Grove .
