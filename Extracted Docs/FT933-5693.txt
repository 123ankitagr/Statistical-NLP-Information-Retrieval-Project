better understanding of the interaction between genes and the environment which controls an individual's susceptibility to disease could lead to personal health cards that identify areas of risk and enable individuals to monitor their progress this could be one result of a new field of research called ecogenetics which examines the way an individual's genetic make-up responds to environmental factors such as chemicals food additives or smoking professor mark ferguson of the department of cell and structural biology at the university of manchester told the association that this would allow healthcare to be better targeted and more cost-effective not all environmental agents caused disease in all people so there was clearly a genetic basis to susceptibility he said understanding how different individuals respond to different external factors is of major importance in trying to understand and prevent as well as treat a number of important disorders if the main susceptibility genes could be mapped it would be possible to produce a health passport for every individual and everyone could be given appropriate preventative advice and screening everyone knows of the association between smoking and lung cancer but not everyone who smokes is at risk of the disease ecogenetics will make it possible to make predictions about an individual's risk prof ferguson said this would make anti-smoking information much more potent humans respond better to warnings about individual risk than to blanket prescriptions it would be possible to target screening services such as breast scans to those with a known genetic risk
