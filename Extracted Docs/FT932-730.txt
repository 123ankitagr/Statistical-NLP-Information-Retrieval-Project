some of you may be wondering how the brownsft fashion workshops went well they seemed to be a huge success in the end we held two as the first was oversubscribed by the first post for me it was lovely to meet so many readers and it was particularly rewarding that so many came from outside london everybody i spoke to enjoyed seeing what some of our designers are up to to see just how a fine jacket can be made to work for its pricetag and how a suit can be worn in many different moods it was extraordinary to hear so many lovely women say that they felt so diffident about their wardrobes but it was good to feel that we gave them the confidence to experiment the clothes were shown on the browns staff who like women everywhere came short and tall skinny and junoesque but all looked terrific this we hope is what the evening did encouraged every woman there to find her own style and to realise that perfect bodies exist only in glossy magazines the rest of us can look good too we may do it again this autumn and possibly something for the chaps so watch this space
