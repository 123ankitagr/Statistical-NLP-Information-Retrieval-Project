Growth in German money supply has exceeded the target range set by the Bundesbank for the fourth consecutive month , writes David Waller in Frankfurt . According to provisional figures , M3 - which comprises cash in circulation as well as savings and short-term time deposits - grew at 7.5 per cent in July on an annualised , seasonally adjusted basis . This follows growth of 7 per cent in June and compares with a target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent . Although the headline figure was in line with the expectations of economists , there was disappointment about a sharp , 8 per cent rise in bank credits to companies and private individuals over the past six months . This is an increase from the 7.6 per cent growth rate in the six months to July . The August M3 was likely to climb still higher , reflecting Bundesbank currency interventions .
