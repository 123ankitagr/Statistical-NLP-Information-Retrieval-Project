A Stockton Superior Court judge who fell asleep during a key part of a murder trial said he will give the defendant a new trial . Judge James Darrah admitted that he dozed for 13 minutes during the testimony of a witness , who said he was with defendant Tab Lee Bennett , 28 , of Galt when William Lang , 25 , of Lodi was shot to death in 1986 . Bennett had waived his right to jury trial and was found guilty by Darrah . Defense attorney Patrick Piggott challenged the verdict , claiming that the judge slept through the presentation of crucial evidence . Piggott said he was referring to a murder scene diagram , when he noticed the judge was snoozing . `` It 's very impressive that he would do that , '' Piggott said after Darrah set April 10 for a hearing to set a new trial date .
