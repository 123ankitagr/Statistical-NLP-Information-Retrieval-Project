For the first time since the city was incorporated more than 30 years ago , City Hall blue-collar workers will be represented by a union . Public Works Department employees , such as maintenance workers and mechanics , on Tuesday voted 24 to 8 to join the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , which will represent them in contract talks . `` We feel very good about it , '' union representative Pete Schnaufer said . `` We won in the face of several obstacles . '' The election victory gives momentum to the union 's discussions with the city to represent clerical workers and part-time recreation employees , Schnaufer said . He said he is willing to begin talks with city administrators immediately . Among the employees ' top concerns are wages and insurance benefits after retirement . Schnaufer and city administrators have had several bitter confrontations since last summer , when the union first told City Hall that its blue-collar employees wanted union representation . Schnaufer has accused city leaders of stalling to avoid an election . Some city leaders have accused Schnaufer of grandstanding . The American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees represents workers in several Southeast cities , including Hawaiian Gardens and Cerritos . Schnaufer said Bellflower city workers approached him in July , after city employees were given a 5 % raise and city administrators received raises up to 15 % . `` The workers blew up , '' Schnaufer said . Since then , Schnaufer and the city have been negotiating on guidelines for union representation . City Councilman Joe Cvetko said Wednesday that he expected the workers to seek union representation as soon as they heard of the management raises . `` The city will survive , '' he said . `` It 's good for the men . I can work with the union . '' Cvetko said he was a member of the National Assn . of Letter Carriers union for many years .
