The United States has given South Korea five months to resolve telecommunications disputes or risk trade sanctions , Seoul officials said today . They also said little progress was being made in the first round of U.S.-South Korean talks on opening Seoul 's market to American telecommunication goods and services . U.S. delegates , led by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative 's director for Korean affairs , Gordana Earp , said South Korea must show sincere commitment in opening its market by Feb. 18 , 1990 , or incur stiff penalties under new U.S. trade laws . Washington accused Seoul in February of keeping its markets closed to American telecom products . It said it would slap up to 100 % tariffs on telecommunications imports from South Korea if bilateral talks fell through .
