The first jointly published American-Soviet campus magazine , to be called Montage , is expected to make its debut early next year , a Stanford University organizer of the project said . `` It 's an idea whose time has come , '' said Susan McKean , 20 , an editor at the Stanford Daily who next month will fly to Moscow for the quarterly magazine 's first editorial meeting with organizers at Moscow State University . The brainchild of McKean and Scott Talcott , 21 , a student at Pepperdine University , the magazine will be published out of a rented office at Stanford , with a first run of 40,000 copies to be mailed to campuses and bookstores across both nations .
