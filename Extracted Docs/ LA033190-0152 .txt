The Pacific Symphony will back Mannheim Steamroller , a five-member group that combines rock , pop , classical and Muzak influences , at the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre June 23 . Chip Davis , Mannheim 's founder , drummer and leader , will conduct . It 's a departure for the 11-year-old orchestra , which normally plays straight classical and light pops fare , but its director of marketing , John MacElwee , said he does not think the booking is a sign of things to come . `` It 's basically an orchestra-for-hire situation , '' MacElwee said Friday . The Pacific was booked through Avalon Attractions , which manages the amphitheater , and `` as in any kind of a booking situation , when they called the Pacific Symphony and hired the entire orchestra , they need to use our name , '' MacElwee said . `` We have a fairly high amount of contract services through the ( Orange County Performing Arts ) Center , '' he continued . `` So we 're used to utilizing the orchestra for contracted services . But we have a good mix ( at the Center ) right now . '' The members of Mannheim Steamroller play everything from lutes , harpsichords and recorders to synthesizers , electronic percussion and digital samplers . The group often performs with pit bands or orchestras . The Irvine Meadows show will be its only Southern California performance . Meanwhile , the Pacific Symphony will give two free concerts for selected Orange County high school students Monday at Plummer Auditorium in Fullerton . Attendance is being determined by individual school districts . Lucas Richman will conduct music by Vivaldi , Handel , Mozart , Mendelssohn and other composers . The concerts are being sponsored by Pacific Telesis Foundation and the California Community Foundation .
