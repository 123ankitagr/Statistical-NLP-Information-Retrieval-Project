Danny Glover , star of `` Lethal Weapon , '' testified Wednesday that stuntman Dar Robinson , who bled to death during the filming of a movie in 1986 , was `` one of the world 's greatest stuntmen . '' Glover 's testimony came during the fourth week of a trial in Los Angeles Superior Court in which Robinson 's widow is suing three movie production companies for damages in connection with the stuntman 's death . Robinson died in November , 1986 , while making the movie `` Million Dollar Mystery . '' During a stunt , his motorcycle sped off a roadway and crashed . The suit against DeLaurentis Entertainment Group , DeLaurentis Film Productions and Productions Limited of Beverly Hills contends the producers were negligent because no ambulance was at the location site in Page , Ariz. , 65 miles from the nearest hospital . Glover 's testimony was aimed at showing that had Robinson lived , he potentially would have earned millions .
