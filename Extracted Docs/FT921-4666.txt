THE government is proposing to reduce the compulsory retirement age for judges from 75 to 70 , Robert Rice writes . In a letter sent to judges in England , Wales and Northern Ireland yesterday Lord Mackay , the Lord Chancellor , said : ' I believe that the time has come to reduce the retirement age for the judiciary , and also to introduce a standard retirement age for all judges and judicial officers . ' Lord Mackay intends that the new retirement age should apply to all those appointed to full-time judicial office after the change comes into force . Judges who hold full-time positions on the day the change is made will be allowed to continue until the present retirement age of 75 provided they remain in the same job and are not promoted . A change in judges ' retirement age will require primary legislation and so can not be introduced until after the election .
