With its Big West opener at Fresno State only a week away , Cal State Fullerton expects to find out today how it will stack up in conference play when it takes on Akron . Titan Coach Gene Murphy considers Akron , a Division I-A independent , on a par with the top Big West teams . Akron is 2-0-1 , but Coach Gerry Faust is quick to point out that victories over Illinois State , 17-7 , and Kent , 38-10 , and a 14-14 tie with Central Michigan are not especially remarkable .
