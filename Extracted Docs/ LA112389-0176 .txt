i think everyone who has the means should be interested in collecting said sothebys chairman john l marion everyone is this man greedy or what as sothebys premier auctioneer in new york marion has knocked down the worlds three most expensive paintings vincent van goghs irises $ 539 million pablo picassos yo picasso $ 479 million and picassos au lapin agile $ 407 million he has also sold the three priciest works by living artists willem de koonings interchange $ 207 million and jasper johns false start $ 17 million and two flags $ 121 million but marion is not content because these big sales get all the press they lead to the misconception that auctions are a sport for the ultrarich he said in a recent interview in fact more than half of the 200000plus lots sold in a year at sothebys go for less than $ 5000 a quarter of them sell for under $ 1000 marion cites these figures repeatedly in the best of everything the insiders guide to collecting for every taste and every budget simon schuster $ 1995 a new book he wrote with christopher andersen while the book is well stocked with anecdotes about the rich and famous the central message is that you dont have to be malcolm forbes to become a smart player in the auction game and smart is definitely the operative word here do your homework marion counsels in one chapter check out the auction houses reputation study the catalogue check out the merchandise ask the experts attend an auction just to observe he also discusses nine criteria for assessing value authenticity condition rarity historic importance and provenance size medium subject matter fashion and aesthetic quality furthermore marion exhorts readers to set a limit on the amount they will bid before setting foot in an auction room buying on impulse is the single biggest mistake any collector can make he writes if this is unexpected advice from a man who wants everyone to collect the things that sothebys sells its actually good for business sophisticated buyers are the best auction customers in the long run they dont stop buying when their homes are furnished they refine their collections branch out trade up and believe their acquisitive passion improves their quality of life in short they become connoisseurs who reap the rewards of making educated decisions and in collecting knowledge is truly power marion said why buy a new rug or piece of furniture when for roughly the same price you can have a more appealing old one that is likely to rise in value he asked if you build a coherent collection of things you love you will be surrounded by objects that have special meaning because you took the trouble to find them and learn about them but whats available to the aspiring collector who lacks donald trumps bank account marion lists african and latin american art american furniture english saltglazed stoneware classic cars and the whole field of collectibles among best bets in his book collectors dont have to buy at auction but marion said that they are missing highquality objects and educational opportunities if they dont education is the prime reason for our success marion said dealers used to be the primary educators of collectors but now the major auction houses have taken over part of that role by publishing catalogues making appraisals and offering a range of customer services he said as collectors have multiplied they have edged dealers out of auctions while dealers once bought 60 of the goods offered at a typical auction and added these treasures to their inventories they now purchase about 40 and many of those sales are ordered by specific clients despite the participation of more and more people misconceptions about auctions persist marion said and thats what persuaded him to write a book he wants his readers to know that you dont have to spend a lot of money to buy at auction you can walk in off the street you can ask questions without fear of ridicule and you can understand whats going on but what if you sneeze scratch your nose or wave at a friend will the auctioneer think you are bidding on a renoir only if you are norton simon
