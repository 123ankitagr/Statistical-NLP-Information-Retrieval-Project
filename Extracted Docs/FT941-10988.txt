When Roula Vlachopoulou took the job of joint managing director of Olympic Airways ' catering business , little did she think that she would become the focus of attention of an international dispute which is embarrassing the Greek government 's attempts to woo foreign investors . Mrs Vlachopoulou is a close friend of Mrs Dimitra Papandreou , the socialist prime minister 's wife , dating back to when they were both air stewardesses with Olympic , the Greek flag carrier . No surprise then to find Mrs V running Olympic Catering following last October 's change of government . However , the idea that the toughest part of her job would be supervising in-flight meals for the prime minister and his cronies has been upset by an ugly legal dispute surrounding one of Greece 's first privatisations . Abela , a Dutch catering company , acquired 49 per cent of Olympic Catering in 1991 , and wanted to exercise its option to buy another 17 per cent of the business before last year 's elections . Olympic prevaricated , fresh faces suddenly appeared in the Olympic boardroom , and Olympic Catering 's top management team was fired . Abela is now suing Olympic Airways for Dollars 100m for breach of contract . Unabashed , Mrs V wants to rehire the 900 Olympic Catering staff Abela had fired in an efficiency drive . Not the sort of action that is going to whet the appetite of other foreign investors pondering a Greek partnership . Nor for that matter will it enhance Olympic Airways ' own chances of getting a sympathetic hearing in Brussels the next time the Greek government tries to bail it out .
