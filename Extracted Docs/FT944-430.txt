West German import prices moved up sharply between October and November , bearing out the Bundesbank 's determination to combat future inflation as expressed in its money supply target for 1995 . The November import price level was 0.8 per cent above that for the previous month and 2.2 per cent above November 1993 , the federal statistics office said . The yearly rate was higher than the 1.9 per cent in both September and October . Producer prices have also been rising more rapidly . Both indicators suggest a later upturn in inflation . The central bank stressed its commitment to reaching its medium-term inflation goal of 2 per cent when setting its M3 target last week . Athough the 1995 target range is unchanged at 4-6 per cent , achieving it will mean a slower average rate of money supply growth than in 1994 . The strong upturn in the economy this year has revived uneasiness about future inflation , although the rate of consumer price growth has been slowing . Provisional figures from four west German states showed a 2.7 per cent annual inflation rate in December ( as in November ) and the Bundesbank expects this to ease to under 2.5 per cent early next year . The average for 1994 was 3 per cent , the statistics office said .
