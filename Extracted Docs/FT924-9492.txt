THE French cabinet yesterday drew up tough rules on the handling of blood for transfusions to try to avoid a repeat of the scandal in which the national transfusion service gave HIV-infected blood to more than 1,200 haemophiliacs . The rules would increase state control over the conditions under which blood is donated , checked for disease and transported , at a time when EC single-market regulations will end the monopoly of the national blood transfusion service . This has become of high political importance in France , following the passing of prison sentences on three senior health service officials accused of criminal negligence and fraud in allowing HIV-contaminated blood to be distributed . Concern has deepened with the revelation that Institut Merieux , a leading pharmaceuticals group , had until November 1985 exported blood without heat-treating it for HIV . The new rules , which will go before parliament for final approval , forbid distribution in France of blood from paid donors , punishable by up to five years in prison and a FFr1m ( Pounds 110,000 ) fine . Blood must be tested for HIV and treated before being distributed and the identities of donors and recipients must be kept confidential . The law also establishes a national blood agency to monitor the collection , processing and distribution of blood products . It will have a team of inspectors , responsible for overseeing 163 blood donation centres , and will be responsible for blood processing laboratories . Previously , the French blood products system had no central organisation , except for the transfusion service , responsible solely for stocking and distribution .
