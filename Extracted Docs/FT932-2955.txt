agricultural and primary products remain the mainstay of new zealand's export efforts and with access problems remaining in many key markets the country is pinning its hopes on a satisfactory outcome of the gatt uruguay round from the mid-1980s the country energetically removed all forms of farming tax incentives and farmer support systems hoping to prove to the world that new zealand could be a model of efficiency and show what an agriculturally-based economy could achieve in a liberalised trading environment profitability is gradually returning to the sector after a difficult transition period when many farmers were forced to leave their properties because of financial difficulties compounded by high interest and exchange rates today most farmers welcome the reforms arguing through their representative body federated farmers that they are succeeding through a combination of hard work efficient practices and low inflation average farm profits remain low however especially for wool and beef farmers new zealand continues to run into trade barriers such as the decision by the us authorities to cut the quota for beef imports from 214,000 to 194,000 tonnes this year access problems continue for lamb exports to the ec despite a quota of 200,000 tonnes exporters believe strong demand could easily see new zealand supplying 250,000 tonnes this year in dairying new zealand is severely limited in the amount of cheese it can supply britain and faces a quota for butter the new zealand authorities attach great importance to further reform in the gatt round this month trade negotiations minister philip burdon warned against pressure to water down measures to liberalise world agricultural trade he said any outcome that reduced any of the proposals was unacceptable to new zealand and other members of the cairns group of agricultural exporting nations we have already made concessions and must be very firm in resisting any further reduction in the draft agreement he said privately new zealand negotiators are confident of a satisfactory outcome however no one expects it to solve all new zealand's problems for example the removal of the present us quota system for beef would open up that market to imports from south american countries who are making strenuous attempts to eliminate foot and mouth disease the new zealand agricultural scene presents a complex picture producers of some commodities are achieving high profits while others continue to struggle high lamb prices in europe and elsewhere have proved a bonanza to some farmers new zealand has had an extended summer of warm temperatures and light rain which has been perfect for lamb production farmers have been holding back stock from meat companies to get the best price in turn this is leading to difficulties for the companies to fill orders from the uk and elsewhere and they are being forced to pay exceptionally high prices for lambs at livestock sales with a positive outlook for the next 18 months for sheepmeat prices the price of a lamb has doubled since last year from around nzdollars 25 to nzdollars 50 however the same farmer is receiving remarkably low prices for fleece wool due to the international recession it is estimated that real wool prices are at their lowest level since the 1930 s in the us the quota system has led to a big rise in prices for new zealand beef at market which are an important ingredient in the hamburger trade last year the us took 76 per cent of new zealand's beef production this year it is taking 55 per cent supply problems in the us has led to the equivalent of a nz 70 cent rise in the american market price in the past six months to around nzdollars 5.35 a kilogram however this apparent bonanza benefitting new zealand farmers as the export companies are being forced to sell the remaining 45 per cent at lower prices elsewhere in the world where they are running into competition from us exports exports of fruit also present a confusing pattern the abundant supplies of fruit of all types last year in the important european market coupled with the loss of the us market led to big headaches for kiwifruit producers returns from kiwifruit tumbled from nzdollars 1 bn to nzdollars 500 m causing serious problems for the newly formed kiwifruit marketing board which has ended up in financial difficulties the board is hoping that a smaller crop this year will eventually lead the industry to recover last year apple exporters earned exceptionally good money most of their crop was sold in european and other markets before the glut of european fruit depressed prices so far this season new zealand apples are selling well in europe especially the new varieties but there is some concern at how more traditional varieties such as granny smiths will sell due to increased competition from south africa and other producers there is optimism that the agreement last month which saw the japanese government agree to import new zealand apples will lead to good returns for orchardists over the next five years this was a significant breakthrough new zealand is now the only country apart from korea allowed to sell apples to japan last year new zealand earned nzdollars 1.3 bn from exporting fish the first time the total had passed the dollars 1 bn mark while optimism remains high that the industry will be earning dollars 2 bn a year by the end of the decade the fishing industry board warned last month that earnings would probably fall this year because of the depth of the northern hemisphere recession which is depressing prices for some varieties in recent months however forestry has turned out to be a real bonanza for farmers and others environmental problems in the us and asia led to a quadrupling of the prices of some timber while prices have since fallen back sharply the price of a new zealand radiata log is still fetching nzdollars 425 a cubic metre compared with nzdollars 150 this time last year new zealand is a world leader in farming timber thanks to its warm climate with ample rain trees flourish and reach maturity in 20 to 25 years with forecasts of growing supply problems over the coming years especially in asia confidence is high that forestry will continue to pay handsome dividends this is leading many farmers to transform large parts of their farms to farming radiata pine trees a process that is making a dramatic difference in the new zealand landscape
