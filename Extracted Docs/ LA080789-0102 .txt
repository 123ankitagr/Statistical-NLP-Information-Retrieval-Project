The FBI said today that its experts believe the body hanging from a rope in a videotape released last week by Lebanese terrorists is likely that of hostage Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins , but offered no judgment about the time and cause of death . An agency statement said `` a judgment has been made within a reasonable degree of medical certainty that the person depicted in the videotape is dead . '' `` Although a positive identification could not be made , numerous observable characteristics were noted , indicating that the person depicted in the videotape is Higgins , '' the FBI said . `` This judgment was made by forensic experts and pathologists . '' Law enforcement sources , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the only way the FBI could deliver a completely positive identification would be to have Higgins ' remains or other physical evidence , such as fingerprints . Higgins , head of a 75-member U.N. peacekeeping team , was kidnaped in south Lebanon on Feb. 17 , 1988 . His captors claimed last Monday that he had been hanged in retaliation for Israel 's refusal to release a kidnaped Muslim cleric . A videotape of a figure , hanging by his neck , bound and gagged , was released that day .
