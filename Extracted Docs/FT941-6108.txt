internet has grown into a global metropolis but like many large cities this electronic community linked by computer networks is now struggling to deal with rising crime last month internet officials reported that tens of thousands of secret passwords had been stolen the thieves obtained keys to the private computer files and messages of their victims the incidents demonstrate the vulnerability of internet and raise questions about its use as an information thoroughfare by businesses and others who may be sending or receiving sensitive information via electronic mail or file transfers despite its genesis in a us department of defence programme in the early 1970 s internet was never intended to be a secure network quite the opposite it began as an electronic communications system for researchers in us universities and government laboratories with the idea of encouraging dialogue and sharing ideas early internet users seldom thought of protecting computer files from intruders security was not a very high priority on internet openness and communications were the most important issues says william yundt director of networking at stanford university california as the internet population grows however that is inevitably changing over the past few years use of internet has grown exponentially as individuals businesses and colleges throughout the world have linked up their computers and local networks to the net as it is commonly called there are now an estimated 20 m internet users and commercial data traffic is increasing at a compound rate of 20 per cent a month says al hoover vice-president of ans a data communications company which operates the high-speed us coast-to-coast backbone of internet for the national science foundation the expanding population of internet has brought with it some undesirable elements these include crackers who make a hobby of breaking into private computer files to date most such incidents appear to have been pranks by individuals out to prove their computer prowess the latest incidents are however unprecedented in scale and may be the work of an organised group internet experts fear a sniffer program masquerading as an innocent computer program was planted in several computers on internet says terry mcgillen of the computer emergency response team cert coordination centre at carnegie-mellon university in pennsylvania this secretly recorded the passwords and names of individuals who accessed the affected computers armed with these passwords the crackers can examine private computer files and record change or destroy data or send computer messages in the name of the password holder last october a cracker obtained passwords that may have been used to access dozens of computers in us japanese and european companies as well as universities and government departments in another case a month earlier the electronic mail and files of a california magazine were invaded by a cracker computers at the university of california have been cracked as has the host computer of the well a california group providing public access to internet victims of the latest incidents include users at computer sites in the us and europe mcgillen says and the preliminary estimate that tens of thousands of passwords may have been compromised could significantly increase we have been flooded with calls and are still gathering data cert has warned all internet users to change their passwords as a precaution however this is only a temporary solution because new passwords could be stolen in the same way the crux of the problem is that passwords currently flow through most computers on internet in clear type making it all too easy for crackers to record them illicitly password encryption is the obvious solution but implementing such a change will take time and is fraught with problems first there needs to be an encryption standard for all computers linked to internet then it would have to be adopted by all computer sites development of an encryption standard is under way however as yundt points out security measures are a nuisance for legitimate network users and can be expensive to implement they also run contrary to the free spirit of open communication that is at the heart of internet culture another potential hurdle is that despite protests from the computer industry the clinton administration this month determined that export controls should remain on most types of encryption technology these controls have already forced the elimination of encryption features from the latest version of the unix operating system used on most internet host computers in the meantime large corporate users of internet are erecting barriers between their internal computer networks and internet prudent organisations no longer keep sensitive information on any computer that is linked to the internet says bruce baker head of the information security program at sri international a research and consulting group for nick trio internet administrator for international business machines watson research centre the challenge is to provide ibm researchers with the benefits of access to internet while protecting ibm's internal computer networks to achieve this ibm and many other commercial internet users create firewalls between internet and their internal computer networks we use secure gateways minicomputers that are one-way links to the internet trio explains all electronic mail sent to ibm via internet for example is collected in a mail gateway isolated from the company's internal networks user authentification a technique widely used to secure corporate networks is also used by ibm to ensure that unwanted visitors do not access its computers via internet ibm researchers wanting to access their computer files while working at home or travelling must identify themselves with a password and also use a smartcard security device that generates the answer to a random challenge which changes every time the system is used fencing off computers from the internet is however analogous to installing burglar alarms on houses without having a police force to deter criminal activity throughout a city ultimately there will have to be some form of policing of the network to ensure data security if the internet metropolis is to remain habitable
