THE premiums Australia 's exporters pay to insure against default by foreign buyers are under review , with higher rates possible on trade with riskier countries , according to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation . According to Mr Graham Nottle , manager of the Treasury and Loans division of EFIC , the review is due to be complete by the end of June : 'The objective would be to move to a more market rate of premium , ' Mr Nottle noted : 'We are adjusting premiums with policy holders . They may not pay more , but may take on more risk themselves . ' The Australian review follows recent decisions by Hermes , the leading German export credit agency , and the US Eximbank , to adjust their premium structures .
