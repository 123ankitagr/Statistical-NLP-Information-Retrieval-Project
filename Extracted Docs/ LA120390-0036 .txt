a 28yearold oceanside man got two surprises when a california highway patrol officer pulled him over on a speeding charge one friday night in orange county although he felt unimpaired he had downed enough beer after work that a breathalyzer test showed his blood alcohol level to register 08 the new legal limit not only was he arrested but he was stripped of his drivers license a second result of the states new and tougher drunk driving laws this year has seen some of the most significant changes in california drunk driving laws in a decade only three other states utah maine and oregon have legal blood alcohol limits as low as california as a result more drivers have been arrested on state highways than ever before and drunk driving convictions are approaching an alltime high the statistics are particularly striking in the sevencounty southern california region in the wake of the new 08 legal limit 16 more drivers have been arrested for drunk driving on the states highways and 10 more drivers were convicted of the crime during the first ten months of this year than during the same period in 1989 to their delight law enforcement officers say the new law which lowers the legal limit from 10 to 08 is allowing them to snare a new kind of drunk driver the ones in the oceanside mans words who are just a little bit drunk they are drivers who were borderline under the old legal limit but clearly can be prosecuted now officials say for an average 150 pound man the new law means drinking two beers instead of three an hour before getting behind the wheel although the average level of intoxication in california is 17 almost 10 or 11000 drivers arrested statewide so far this year by the california highway patrol had a level of 10 or less the new law also allows police to confiscate a drunk drivers license on the spot a provision that tends to leave an indelible mark on the memories of drunk drivers officials say but the tougher laws have also had some unintended consequences many more drivers are choosing to fight the charges in court believing they are unimpaired at the 08 limit a claim that medical authorities dispute its understandable that a driver feels that way but from a scientists point of view a driver is impaired at 08 said dr lonnie bristow a physician and trustee with the american medical assn which prefers a 05 legal limit the controversy over the lower limit also has been responsible for a rise of as much as 20 in jury trials in some areas such as orange county at the lower blood alcohol levels drivers dont feel they were under the influence their memory of the event is pretty good and they feel they didnt do it said judge john ouderkirk of the los angeles traffic court at the higher range they dont remember anything and in their heart they know they were under the influence officials in san diego who also report an increase in drunk driving trials say that although they are prosecuting 15 more cases this year the lowlevel cases are more difficult to pursue in these cases drivers can more readily perform the field sobriety tests such as walking a straight line and officers depend more heavily on chemical tests to show intoxication during trials the chemical tests draw fire as lawyers attempt to downplay their reliability experts say the tests can deviate by 01 skillful defense attorneys can through clever arguments persuade an earnest jury that there is a 02 deviation in the breath test some juries buy that said gretchen north head deputy city attorney in san diego but obviously we wouldnt be picking up the 08s if we werent winning them and dmv records show that the increase in arrests has led to more drunk driving convictions in the southland the laws are doing what was intended closing the loopholes and increasing arrests and convictions said paul snodgrass the drivingundertheinfluence coordinator with the national highway traffic safety administrations san francisco regional office increased conviction is increased deterrent as far as we are concerned the 08 law means less people will drive drunk said carolee newman spokeswoman for the los angeles chapter of mothers against drunk driving the law is outstanding officer gil payne a 20year veteran assigned to the california highway patrol in san juan capistrano says he sees a difference on the roads payne describes himself as a deuce buster or an officer who specializes in nabbing drunk drivers for the last 16 years payne has worked a ninehour shift that starts at 730 pm considered prime time for drinking drivers we have come a long way from 10 years ago payne said people are finding out that the risk just isnt worth it the penalties are getting tougher and tougher on a recent friday night payne and his partner leon lasage patrolled the san juan capistrano highways and roadways driving 162 miles by the end of their shift they had doled out several speeding tickets and made two drunk driving arrests one man a 20yearold from laguna niguel had zoomed around a street corner tires squealing after being pulled over he scored a low but still illegal blood alcohol level on the handheld breath analysis device although readings from this device can not be used as evidence in court chp officers frequently use it to doublecheck their own estimates of a drivers impairment handcuffed and placed in the patrol car the man objected there are many more people who are more intoxicated than i am usually the introduction of a new law heightens awareness of a problem which in turn tends to boost arrests and convictions said cliff helander research manager of the dmvs alcohol research unit but some courts are limited in what they can do many experts say across california a dui case takes an average of six months to adjudicate many experts say that by the time an intoxicated driver is punished by the legal system he has long since forgotten his crime in hopes of addressing the problem the new prompt license suspension law went into effect in july traffic experts believe this sanction will probably do more to keep drunk drivers off the road than the 08 limit under the license suspension law officers can seize the licenses of those arrested on suspicion of drunk driving if their blood alcohol level is 08 or higher they can also yank the license if the driver refuses to undergo a chemical test in place of the license officers provide a 45day temporary license drivers have 10 days to appeal the license suspension to the department of motor vehicles many however are unaware of the suspension law so they are stunned when an officer plucks their license since july 105000 drivers statewide have had their licenses pulled when they were arrested for driving while intoxicated one 29yearold san clemente woman said the sting of a license suspension was effective i made a stupid mistake and its the price ive got to pay said the paralegal typist its just a hassle the whole thing made me feel like a criminal with prompt license suspension the punishment immediately follows the crime which makes it one of the most powerful tools to help keep intoxicated drivers off the roads said snodgrass of the national highway traffic safety administration when you take a license away some drive anyway but most dont he said similar license suspension laws are on the books in 28 states and the district of columbia one study in those states showed that prompt license suspension reduced fatal crashes by about 9 so far fatal traffic accidents of all kind not just alcoholrelated ones have declined by about 7 on californias roads but officials are uncertain whether to credit the new drunk driving laws for this accomplishment or the fact that more people are wearing seat belts said sam haynes a chp spokesman while some lawyers have questioned whether this sanction violates a drivers right to due process a supreme court case however upheld the law in 1979 others drivers and lawyers say the law is crippling and poses hardship in southern california which has little public transportation but many others say the double punch of yanking a license and the lower drinking limit is effective if i could turn back time i would turn back friday night said the san clemente typist i didnt need to get behind the wheel and drive that arrest made me sober up fast a wider net for
