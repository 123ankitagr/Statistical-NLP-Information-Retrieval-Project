the bundesbank has been criticised by the chief economist of germanys largest commercial bank for relying on unsuitable indicators in the pursuit of its monetary policies writes andrew fisher in frankfurt speaking a week after what he called the de facto suspension of the european monetary system mr norbert walter of deutsche bank said m3 the broad money supply indicator targeted by the central bank was obviously distorted and devalued as an indicator yet the bundesbank still used m3 as a basis for its policies he said in a newspaper interview he also charged the bundesbank with forgetting its own analysis when using inflation rates as an argument for its actions this showed monetary policy took twoandahalf years to influence prices moreover the inflation rate was overstated as a result of the many rises in indirect taxes german inflation exceeds 4 per cent a year and m3 has been growing at an annualised rate of around 7 per cent these are above the levels desired by the bundesbank which had thus been reluctant to speed up interest rate cuts however mr walter did not blame the banks high interest rates for curbing economic growth in europe inflation unemployment and the budgetary strains resulting from these are mainly caused by erroneous economic and wage policies he said
