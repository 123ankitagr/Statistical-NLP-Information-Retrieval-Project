A sheriff 's deputy 's killer , whose 1985 grant of clemency from New York Gov . Mario M. Cuomo was denounced by then-Vice President George Bush , has been granted parole . The decision to release Gary McGivern , convicted of murder in the 1968 shooting , followed his appearance before a three-member Board of Parole panel at the medium-security prison in Otisville where he is serving a life sentence . It was McGivern 's third parole board appearance since Cuomo 's grant of clemency , which made him eligible for an immediate parole hearing . Twice McGivern was turned down because of the nature of the crime .
