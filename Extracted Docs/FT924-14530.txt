taiwan takes a significant step towards democracy in december with the first fully representative elections to the legislative yuan or parliament constitutionally this body approves the government budget and has authority over a range of government bills but its powers have rarely been used and its credibility was undermined until last year because more than half its members were elected in mainland china in 194748 before the nationalist government fled to taiwan the old guard retired last december paving the way for the direct election on december 19 of 125 legislators six representatives of overseas chinese communities and 30 at large seats decided by each partys vote in constituency elections the new status likely to be accorded to legislators suggests the yuan will become more like a western parliament with questioning and debate of government policy social issues could become more prominent division on these and other issues could emerge within the ruling kuomintang kmt party a struggle for supremacy is also possible between the yuan and the national assembly which elects the president and adopts constitutional amendments but taiwans progress towards full democracy initiated with the lifting of martial law in 1987 has so far been relatively smooth and the kmt is expected to easily win a majority of the seats on offer in december the party will stress the islands economic success steady moves to democracy and stable relations with china as reasons to support the government the great majority of voters are economically speaking doing well and they are happy said james chu kmt spokesman the main opposition democratic progressive party meanwhile has been muted since it campaigned on an independent taiwan ticket in last years elections for the national assembly although most taiwanese support the existing state of de facto independence the campaign frightened people who believe chinas threat to use military force to reunify taiwan if it seeks formal independence china of course still regards taiwan as a renegade province the dpp polled only 24 per cent of votes and has decided to campaign on other issues this time it will attack the governments usdollars 306bn infrastructure spending plans for being inflationary and likely to lead to tax increases mr hsu hsinliang dpp chairman says he hopes his party will win 30 per cent of the vote he complained justifiably that in spite of moves to democracy elections are not fair the kmt controls taiwans three television stations and because candidates need to spend dollars 1m or more getting elected the kmts links with business ensure it ample backing and an inbuilt majority the dpp is seeking to tone down its popular image as a group of firebrand radicals fist fights in the legislature which were mainly designed for show and reflected the oppositions frustration at being in such a minority are likely to die away but the dpps poor internal organisation suggests it will take time for the party to decide whether it should be a responsible opposition in a dominant party system or return to merely a protest movement the independence issue has not been resolved either although it has been temporarily shelved according to opinion polls most taiwanese are happy with their present state of de facto independence and would welcome eventual reunification with a democratic china but younger taiwanese are less sure and are frustrated by taiwans lack of international recognition taiwanese also resent the continuing grip on power held by descendants of mainlanders who fled to taiwan in 1949 but make up less than 15 per cent of the population although mr lee tenghui is the islands first taiwanese president mr hau peitsun who as premier has effective daytoday control over the island and most of his senior cabinet are mainlanders the line between taiwanese and mainlanders is still very clear said mr lin yusiong a taiwanese kmt legislator this division is likely to come to the fore again next year in the lead up to the kmts party congress and is symbolised by a simmering dispute over the method of election for the next presidential elections due in 1996 president lee and his supporters are believed to be in favour of direct elections while conservatives within the administration many of them mainlanders would prefer elections through a form of electoral college to limit the popular appeal of the presidents office the issue is further complicated because elected members of the national assembly fear their most important function would be redundant if direct elections took place a heated debate on the issue within the kmt reached impasse in march and the question has been put on hold in a terse statement the kmt said an extraordinary meeting of the national assembly will be held by may 1995 to select the method of electing the president and vicepresident according to public opinion
