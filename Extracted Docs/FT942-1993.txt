Taipei has responded coolly to a request from Beijing to resume high-level contacts , insisting questions relating to the March murders of 24 Taiwanese tourists in China be addressed first , a government official said yesterday . On Friday , Mr Wang Daohan , Beijing 's chief negotiator for Taiwan affairs , faxed a letter to his Taiwanese counterpart seeking an 'urgent meeting ' to resolve differences - the first time the two would meet since 1993's ground-breaking talks , when officials from both sides held talks for the first time in more than 40 years . 'We have sent nine letters to the Chinese side about the tourists , ' a spokesman for Taiwan 's Mainland Affairs Council said . 'We want to resolve the issue . But so far we have received no answer ' . The Qiandao Lake incident occurred when the tourists were robbed and their boat torched . Three Chinese were executed , but Taiwanese suspect they were scapegoats . China has been accused of covering up military involvement .
