barbara nagy i feel what happened to your students is par for the course teacher angry after police search latino youths invited to her home the times sept 9 it has happened to me too many times not to believe it is so for example last week while my daughter and i teachers stopped at manhattan mall for a quick purchase her latino husband waited in the car in the back seat two manhattan beach policemen questioned him why was he here who owned the car did he steal it did he have a gun did he have any drugs was he waiting for an accomplice to run out why was he eating in the car he showed his id and they left but why did they question him he was just sitting there i've become so anti-police but i have to remind myself that most police are young and very naive still think in prejudicial stereotypes i'm still furious mary campbell manhattan beach
