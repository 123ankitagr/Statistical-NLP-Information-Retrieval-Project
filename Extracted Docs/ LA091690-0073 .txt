Barbara Nagy , I feel what happened to your students is par for the course ( `` Teacher Angry After Police Search Latino Youths Invited to Her Home , '' The Times , Sept. 9 ) . It has happened to me too many times not to believe it is so . For example : Last week while my daughter and I ( teachers ) stopped at Manhattan Mall for a quick purchase , her Latino husband waited in the car , in the back seat . Two Manhattan Beach policemen questioned him . Why was he here ? Who owned the car ? Did he steal it ? Did he have a gun ? Did he have any drugs ? Was he waiting for an accomplice to run out ? Why was he eating in the car ? He showed his ID and they left . But why did they question him ? He was just sitting there ! ! I 've become so anti-police , but I have to remind myself that most police are young and very naive -- still think in prejudicial stereotypes . I 'm still furious . MARY CAMPBELL Manhattan Beach
