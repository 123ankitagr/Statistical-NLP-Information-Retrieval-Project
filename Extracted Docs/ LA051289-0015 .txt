Ventura Boulevard in Sherman Oaks was closed in both directions for almost four hours Thursday when a truck carrying concrete slabs became wedged beneath the San Diego Freeway overpass , Los Angeles police said . Traffic Officer Dennis Smith said the accident occurred about 5:30 a.m. when the tractor-trailer drove under the overpass near Sepulveda Boulevard and the Sherman Oaks Galleria and two precast concrete walls became jammed against the overpass . The truck was heading west to a construction site , Smith said . Some of the slabs crumbled upon impact and chunks of concrete fell onto eastbound lanes of Ventura Boulevard , he said . No one was injured and there apparently was no damage to the overpass , police said . Truck driver Larry Borrink reportedly had measured the height of his four-ton cargo before going under the overpass and erroneously thought that there was clearance , Smith said . After the cargo became wedged , Borrink could not remove the truck by bleeding air from its tires because authorities feared that the maneuver might shift the load and cause it to spill . Because of the debris in the street and the danger that the slabs might fall off the truck , police closed all six traffic lanes while a heavy-equipment tow truck pulled the slabs off the truck . The roadway was reopened about 9:15 a.m. , Smith said . The accident caused traffic to back up in both directions on Ventura Boulevard , police said . Detoured traffic also caused snarls on Sepulveda Boulevard and other nearby streets . Police said Borrink was cited for carrying too tall a load on his truck and for not having a city permit allowing him to transport an oversized load on city streets .
