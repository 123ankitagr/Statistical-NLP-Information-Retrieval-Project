United Education & Software , an Encino operator of trade schools , said its fiscal first-quarter profit plunged 98 % from a year earlier on a 7 % decline in revenue . In the quarter ended April 30 , United Education 's net income dropped to $ 24,000 from $ 1.1 million , while its revenue fell to $ 20.6 million from $ 22.2 million . United Education blamed the declines on relatively low unemployment rates , which reduced enrollment at its training schools , and higher interest costs .
