THE New Zealand Futures & Options Exchange , acquired by Sydney Futures Exchange last year , is to link its computerised futures market with the Australian market , AP-DJ reports from Wellington . Plans will now proceed to allow trading on New Zealand futures contracts in Australia . The link is expected to increase liquidity in local futures trading . A survey of Sydney exchange members shows that between 15 and 20 of them planned to link with the New Zealand exchange . Mr Les Hosking , chief executive of the Sydney exchange , said extra liquidity from Australia and further afield would help the New Zealand financial market use futures and options on futures to manage risk .
