mr james baker has the reputation of being a political magician if he pulls president george bush's re-election campaign out of its present troubles he will be promoted into the miracle-worker class that the secretary of state is to return to the white house soon to take charge of both the campaign and domestic policy is now a done deal whatever mr baker's or others protestations to the contrary the move has been expected for weeks mr bush's substantial trailing of governor bill clinton the democratic nominee has rendered inevitable a repeat of 1988, when mr baker left the treasury to manage the bush effort when the then vice-president was trailing in the polls though by a narrower margin than now mr baker is currently on a trip to the middle east and asia the shift may not be formally announced until after mr yitzhak rabin israel's new prime minister comes to washington next month a visit with domestic political connotations just before the republican party convention mr lawrence eagleburger mr baker's deputy is likely to be appointed acting secretary of state federal law permits the president up to 120 days to nominate a permanent replacement allowing him to avoid a potentially difficult confirmation process in congress before the november 3 presidential election mr clinton was quick to argue that transferring mr baker demonstrated the limits of mr bush's commitment to an active foreign policy at a time when israel's change of government opened new possibilities in the middle east mr baker will come in over the heads of mr sam skinner the white house chief of staff and mr robert teeter titular campaign chairman and also an old friend neither will object to being superseded he may bring with him some of his inner circle of advisers at the state department including ms margaret tutwiler the spokeswoman and mr robert zoellick the counsellor who effectively takes charge of international economic policy the toughest issue for the campaign lately has been whether to dump vice-president dan quayle from the republican ticket mr quayle whose selection by mr bush in 1988 did not meet mr baker's approval is unpopular except with party conservatives one poll this week reported that 60 per cent of those questioned would not mind if he were replaced but mr bush yesterday dismissed rumours that mr quayle might be dropped asked by reporters if mr quayle's status was uncertain mr bush responded no it's very certain replacing mr quayle would be tricky if general colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and gulf war hero ran with mr bush it might be easy to argue that ditching mr quayle was not an act of desperation but mr baker himself is thought to harbour presidential ambitions and might be reluctant to advance the cause of potential rivals by promoting them to number two on the ticket they include mr dick cheney secretary of defence senator phil gramm of texas and governor pete wilson of california it is probable therefore that mr quayle will stay where he is which could help win back some of the conservative support that defected to mr ross perot who ruled out a bid for the presidency last week the overriding task in any case is to transform mr bush into a candidate in whom the country can have confidence for four more years at present mr clinton full of confidence and ideas is making all the running
