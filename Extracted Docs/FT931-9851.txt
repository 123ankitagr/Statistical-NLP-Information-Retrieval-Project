CANARY WHARF and other developments in London 's docklands were still destined to become a 'symbol of prosperity ' , a defiant Mr John Redwood , minister for local government and inner cities , told the Commons last night , Ivor Owen writes . His optimism was ridiculed by Mr Doug Henderson , shadow local government minister , who said Canary Wharf had become 'the lost city of Wapping ' . Mr Redwood was taunted from the Labour benches over a forecast he made in 1988 that docklands would be seen as an example of the success of 'popular capitalism ' , with Canary Wharf as globally famous as Trafalgar Square . The minister was reminded he had said the government would recover the money it had provided for the docklands development , over a 10-year period . Mr Henderson said : 'Instead of getting the money back , the developers are asking for more to save the project . ' Mr Redwood urged his critics to 'wait to see what happens yet ' . He insisted that Canary Wharf - which Mr Henderson said was 85 per cent empty - was already a famous name .
