the recent sale by chrysler one of the big three us carmakers of its final 2.7 per cent stake in japan's mitsubishi motors ended an equity link that spanned more than two decades by coincidence on the same day the us court of international trade ruled against a charge brought by us carmakers that japanese manufacturers were dumping mini-vans in the us market the relationship between us and japanese carmakers has always been as much coloured by politics as ruled by business interests in the past the wrangling has centred on the us car market with us makers calling on politicians to curb the japanese onslaught on their home territory but now the focus of political and business interest has been shifting from the us to japan a complex web of relationships has grown up between the big three and their japanese rivals these gave us manufacturers smaller fuel-efficient cars and introduced them to japanese-style manufacturing methods while allowing japanese car companies a direct route into the us market the japanese market was never a focus of these alliances in 1992 imported cars took only a 4.1 per cent share but changes in the political and business environment have wrought a shift in roles now japanese car executives sense a greater interest among us manufacturers in penetrating the japanese market and worry that us companies might be serious about using their corporate links to expand their share ford is now serious about entering the japanese market says mr yoshihiro wada president of mazda although the us company has had a dealer network of 300 stores for more than 10 years which mazda set up to sell ford cars ford was not particularly enthusiastic about selling to the japanese market mr wada says that has changed ford recently announced that it would start supplying the japanese market with right-hand drive models including the best-selling taurus from next year the us company is also setting up a technical centre in tokyo to help increase sales of its auto parts to japanese carmakers general motors meanwhile has been pushing toyota to sell gm cars through its dealer network in april the us company said the two had agreed in principle to manufacture a car in the us for the japanese market with toyota handling the distribution the japanese company says it is still considering the proposal many japanese car companies acknowledge a debt to the us industry in helping them realise their global ambitions it is questionable whether mitsubishi would have grown into the company it now is without the tie-up with chrysler says mr taizo yokoyama managing director of mitsubishi motors which has been selling about 40 per cent of its cars in the us through chrysler's dealers nissan says it was able to develop the quest multi-purpose car because of its tie-up with ford both companies wanted a new multi-purpose vehicle but independent development would have been too costly says mr junji shibata general manager of nissan's european and north american operations group japanese manufacturers have had to dissociate business interests from the political pressures for example ford which has had a 24.5 per cent stake in mazda joined gm and chrysler in calling for anti-dumping duties on japanese mini-vans including mazda's mpv wagon however mr wada describes ford as acting from political necessity not from a desire to cause mazda difficulties they are speaking on a political level he says but as us companies step up their efforts to enter the japanese market the sacrifices japanese carmakers may have to make are overshadowing the advantages they see in their links with us companies while the japanese makers say they are willing to help us competitors in their home market they emphasise the need for clear business incentives for such co-operation we are considering selling chrysler cars through our dealers says mitsubishi's mr yokoyama but it depends on how competitive chrysler's cars will be in japan if they can do what the japanese did in the us and provide domestic manufacturers with cars that they lack the possibilities for partnerships would increase mr yokoyama suggests chrysler for example is riding high on a japanese craze for four-wheel drive cars and provides honda with its jeep cherokee meanwhile with the yen's appreciation buying us-made parts or finished products may actually make good business sense for japanese manufacturers but the consensus is that us carmakers still have some way to go in meeting the needs of japan's demanding consumers ford's enthusiasm about the japanese market does not mean it will have a car that will do well in japan this year or even next year mr wada says with the us domestic car market in one of its worst post-war slumps and protectionist calls hampering their advance overseas japanese carmakers must be hoping their us partners prove to be slower students in the japanese market than they were many years ago in the us
