TAIWAN 'S biggest bank said it would stop providing loans for investment in China to stem a rapidly growing outflow of capital to the Chinese mainland , Reuter reports from Taipei . According to the government-run radio , the state-owned Bank of Taiwan said the measure would stimulate sluggish domestic investment and boost the island 's economy because excessive capital outflow to China was causing a severe shortage of funds at home . Bank of Taiwan will refuse applications from local companies for loans to invest in China , and will close all channels for remittances of funds there Mr Pu Chen-ming , the bank 's president , said . The bank 's decision , reached at a board meeting on Monday , would pressure other banks to cut their China lending , Mr Pu said . Total Taiwanese investment in China has soared to well over USDollars 3bn since political tensions began easing in the late 1980s . Net capital outflow from Taiwan surged to Dollars 1.2bn in the first quarter of this year from Dollars 550m a year earlier , and economists say much of the money went to China . Government officials and analysts are concerned at the outflow , saying it was helping to push up domestic interest rates and suck money from the battered stock market . It was not clear how much of an effect the decision would have on Taiwanese investment in China , as many businesses obtain funds through channels other than domestic banks .
