Trying to create an impact such as he could not make last year , running back Russell White donned a Cal practice jersey for the first time Friday . The Crespi High record-setter was ineligible to play football for the Golden Bears last season under terms of Proposition 48 . `` Everyone else wants to know , 'Who is Russell White and what can he do on the college level ? ' `` said White , who on Friday morning completed an English requirement , his last obstacle to eligibility . `` But I want to know myself . '' White , who chose Cal over USC , established a state high school rushing record of 5,998 yards at Crespi , including 2,339 yards and 31 touchdowns his sophomore year . On letter-of-intent signing day , White claimed that he could win the Heisman Trophy his freshman year and eventually lead Cal to a Rose Bowl . But after failing four times to score the minimum requirement of 700 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test , he became a Prop . 48 casualty and was unable to participate in practices or games until Friday . `` I was lost when I said that , '' White said of his signing-day boast . `` I wish I could take it back , but I ca n't turn back the clock . '' Now a sophomore after losing a year of eligibility , White comes into Cal 's training camp third on the depth chart behind senior Anthony Wallace and redshirt freshman Lindsey Chapman . Wallace ran for 560 yards last season . White said that being a Prop . 48 casualty was the best thing that could have happened to him . `` When I was coming here , I was going to finish ( earn a degree ) , because that 's the way I 've been brought up , '' White said . `` Do n't start something you ca n't finish . If you do n't have a degree from a university , you ca n't do much in life . I want to eat sirloin . '' The Bears , 4-7 a year ago , open their season at Wisconsin on Sept. 8 .
