an unqualified mate was piloting the exxon valdez violating both coast guard regulations and company policy when the tanker crashed into rocks unleashing the worst oil spill in us history exxon shipping co said sunday exxon also disclosed that the long beachbound tanker actually was involved in two separate accidents that night in pristine prince william sound meanwhile winds kicked up around the crippled ship stirring fears that choppy waters could destabilize the exxon valdez and sweep the slick ashore wildlife experts were summoned from california to coordinate any efforts to rescue birds and sea otters whose feathers and fur make them the most vulnerable to oil contamination oilcovered birds otters biologists already have counted 95 birds and two otters covered with oil but were unable to capture them for cleaning killer whales sea lions and ducks also have been spotted swimming in the muck cleanup efforts continued slowly and alaska gov steve cowper declared prince william sound a disaster area freeing state resources for cleanup and paving the way for a federal disaster declaration many questions about the disaster remained unanswered still unexplained is why third mate gregory cousins was steering the 987foot vessel through the tricky icebergdotted waters on friday frank iarossi president of exxon shipping told reporters that capt joseph hazelwood was one flight below the bridge in his cabin when the exxon valdez hit the first jagged rock pinnacle about a mile outside shipping lanes the ship then slid about two miles under full power and hit more underwater rocks iarossi said at no time did the ship lose steering he added iarossi said he did not know whether hazelwood took the wheel after the first accident or how much time elapsed between the two incidents there would have been no reason for the 42yearold captain to go below to use the bathroom or get coffee since both are available on the bridge iarossi said i agree something is missing iarossi told reporters and local residents at a press conference cousins a threeyear employee of exxon did not have the coast guard certification required to pilot through the sound but was qualified under other circumstances to steer the ship iarossi said puts off filing charges were not going to file any charges until we are done with our investigation said coast guard spokesman todd nelson the coast guard may seem slow and plodding at times but if we file charges were going to make them stick he added nelson said piloting a ship without proper certification is a civil not criminal violation which ultimately could result in suspension or revocation of the captains license exxon has not made any of the exxon valdezs 20 crew members available for interviews the coast guard served subpoenas saturday on the captain helmsman and third mate to ensure that they make themselves available to investigators a team from the national transportation safety board arrived sunday to probe the cause of the accident experts from the international bird rescue center in berkeley calif set up a rehabilitation center here sunday in case oiled birds are captured otter experts from hubbs marine research institute at sea world in san diego were due to arrive today but even if animals turn up in distress rescues may not be feasible human life and safety is more important said pamela bergmann the department of the interior representative assessing the situation she said it might be too perilous to try to capture panicky birds and otters from boats in the frigid water and there is no road access to the shores where they are likely to show up a monitor from the us fish and wildlife service said he felt encouraged about impact on the areas abundant marine life after patrolling the 50squaremile slick by boat saturday the reason we havent seen a large number of birds affected so far is that the oil is out in the middle of the sound said everett robinsonwilson the agencys environmental contaminant coordinator the weather will help us or kill us he added winds of up to 35 mph were expected by today neither exxon nor the state and federal agencies involved in the operation could say how much oil had been mopped up or what percentage of the slick is contained the exxon valdez spewed about 250000 barrels of north slope crude into the iceblue waters another 1 million barrels remain aboard the damaged ship but no new leakage has been reported pumps were being used to siphon the remaining oil into a sister tanker sunday an operation expected to take up to a week salvagers hope the twoyearold exxon valdez will be able to float free once its load is lightened up to $ 20 million damages iarossi estimated damage to the $ 125million ship at $ 10 million to $ 20 million videotapes filmed by divers revealed 10 sizable holes in the ships hull ranging from 8 feet by 15 feet to 20 feet by 6 feet iarossi said rocks charted he indicated that the rocks the ship hit were charted and well within range of the exxon valdezs navigational equipment no disciplinary action has been taken against any crew members iarossi said the executive promised to make public results of mandatory drug and alcohol tests on crew members so far oil has washed ashore only on two tiny islands in the sound and beach cleanup efforts were under way hasnt seen plan we have been told by exxon that they will come up with an organized cleanup plan but weve yet to see one said barbara holian spokeswoman for the state department of environmental conservation the agency is studying its legal options and may ask the coast guard to take over the cleanup from exxon she said at coast guard offices here nelson said such a move was unlikely the coast guard doesnt have tons and tons of its own equipment and it would have to hire the same people exxon has nelson said that would just slow things down right now exxon is the oil company with the deep pockets and its cleaning
