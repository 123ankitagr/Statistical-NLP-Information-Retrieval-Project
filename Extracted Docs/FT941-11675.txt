Jonathan Charkham , a member of the Cadbury committee on corporate governance and former adviser to the Bank of England , has become an adviser to Pensions and Investment Research Consultants . PIRC has made a name for itself advising UK local authority pension schemes in particular about such matters as corporate governance and ethical investment , thus identifying itself with a distinctly non-City clientele . PIRC also advises some US investors on corporate governance matters in the UK and was instrumental in forcing Hanson to back down last year on proposals to weaken the ability of shareholders to challenge board members at the annual general meeting . Charkham is a non-executive director of GUS - itself under fire for some aspects of its corporate governance ; his book , Keeping good company : Corporate governance in five countries , is published this month by OUP .
