there are two sides to weight control calories eaten and calories burned up the only way to lose weight permanently is to strike a balance between the two but the realities of business life are heavily stacked against balance of any sort it is too easy to get locked into a pattern of dumping an increasing number of calories on to a system that is increasingly sedentary most business meals are large and laden with fat sugar and alcohol they are also eaten under stressful conditions late in the evening and on the run in hotels aeroplanes and conferences this recipe for chronic fatigue and overweight is followed by hundreds of thousands of managers around the world the morbid results are high blood pressure diabetes heart disease blood cholesterol not to mention shattered self-confidence once the warning lights start flashing you go to the doctor and get put on a diet unfortunately most diets employ draconian methods and are scientifically dubious to boot making them a short-term success but a long-term disaster this is because they concentrate exclusively on how many calories are going in to be discussed in the next health check they ignore the key ingredient for long-term success your metabolic rate or the number of calories used up by your body every day when your doctor tells you that you are overweight your knee-jerk reaction is probably to go on a diet perhaps skip a few meals cancel that lunch reservation at your favourite restaurant but to do that will send the wrong message to your body the body does not know you are skipping lunch because you want to lose weight its survival mechanisms will be alerted to an imminent famine and it will slow down the metabolism to conserve energy it will even prepare to use its own muscle protein as a calorie source if you spend lunchtime sitting still at your desk your metabolism will be reduced further so how can you increase your metabolic rate in a safe and practical way the good news is that you need to eat but eat wisely shift the bulk of your daily calories to earlier in the day when your metabolism is higher and you can handle the calorie load the overwhelming majority of executives that i see every year report that they consume 60 per cent or more of their daily calorie intake at dinner the only possible message to the body is to store those calories as fat there is nothing wrong with having snacks between meals eating nuts wholewheat biscuits or fruit maintains the metabolic rate and keeps the level of blood sugar constant exercise is also important but there is no need to don the sneakers and sprint round the park mild exercise can increase your metabolic rate particularly after meals leave the table 15 minutes earlier and walk briskly back to the office recent research shows that for every 15 minutes of brisk walking after a meal your metabolic rate will remain high for 30 minutes while you are back at the office sitting in front of the computer that is high leverage do not wait for that imaginary weekend or vacation to come when you begin to eat sensibly and play a strenuous game of tennis you did not get into this situation overnight you are not going to get out of it overnight either so start now
