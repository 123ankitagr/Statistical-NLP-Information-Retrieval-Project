sir the complexities of price comparisons between the us and uk and between bt and mercury are such that even your reporter has been misled the article competition on the line april 29 actually compared mercury's best peak price to the us 8 am to 8 pm with bt's off-peak' price the correct comparison for a three-minute call to the us taking the best business price for each company in peak time is 122.15 p from mercury and 123.55 p from bt while mercury charges for the exact call length to the nearest 100 th of a second bt still charges by the unit this means that the bt customer has to pay for the unused time left over taking this into account statistically mercury's best business price saves customers an average of 8 per cent in the peak period the leading independent expert's comparison octagon telecomms tariffs 1993 concludes if a customer does have access to the directly connected mercury 2100 service there are no grounds from a pricing point of view for using bt for any outgoing calls in terms of benefit to uk business it is now cheaper to call the us or anywhere in europe using mercury than in the reverse direction terry rhodes director of competition policy mercury communications
