Ontario , Canada 's biggest province , has had its double-A minus debt rating confirmed by Standard & Poor 's , the US credit rating agency . Ontario 's recent budget forecast a CDollars 8.5bn ( USDollars 6.2bn ) deficit for 1994-95 , higher than originally forecast but down from CDollars 9.4bn in 1993-94 . The rating outlook is stable , the agency said , reflecting Ontario's diversified economy . It had lowered Ontario 's ratings from double-A last year reflecting the province 's rising debt and heavy servicing costs . Quebec 's budget late last week forecast a CDollars 4.4bn deficit for 1994-95 . Standard & Poor 's said that it was studying its previous rating of A-plus with stable outlook .
