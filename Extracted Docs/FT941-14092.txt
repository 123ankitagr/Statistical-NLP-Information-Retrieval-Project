Sanshin , a Japanese non-life insurance company affiliated with Sanwa Bank , a leading commercial bank , is to set up a joint reinsurance venture in the UK with Robert Fleming Insurance Brokers , a member of the UK merchant bank group . Sanshin Fleming Reinsurance Brokers will be established in London this month , with Sanshin and Robert Fleming Insurance each holding 42.5 per cent stakes , and Japan England Insurance Brokers the remaining 15 per cent . The company will be the first Japanese insurance company to be involved in the reinsurance business . The move comes ahead of the deregulation of the Japanese insurance market in 1996 , when insurance brokers are expected to be allowed into the market . The Japanese insurance industry , one of the country 's most tightly-regulated financial markets , is bracing itself ahead of the liberalisation , and trying to expand and diversify operations . Sanshin said it wanted to acquire know-how of the reinsurance business , and hoped to eventually win contracts from Japanese insurance companies , which currently rely on European and US reinsurers .
