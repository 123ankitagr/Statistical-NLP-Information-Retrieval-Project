after four years and ten tours mikhail baryshnikovs modern dance troupe the white oak dance project finally opened in new york last week why had baryshnikov avoided new york for so long was it as certain new york reviewers asked with obvious satisfaction because of the new york reviewers maybe a little baryshnikovs nine controversial years as director of american ballet theater 198089 did not leave him with tender feelings either toward large dance companies or toward the new york dance world with its politics and policies as he put it darkly in a recent interview with the new york times when after leaving abt he founded white oak he said that this troupe would be for fun he wanted to experiment in a relaxed atmosphere that is why he hired older dancers the companys age range is 31 to 46 no teenagers no hysteria and that no doubt is why he did did not rush to arrange a new york season which for almost any company is a tense overadvertised overanalysed moneylosing business about money he need not have worried baryshnikov is still the worlds most famous dancer and he performs at every white oak show given that fact white oak normally sells out any theatre it enters new york state theater was no exception when baryshnikov stepped onstage on opening night so many flashbulbs went off that it looked as though someone had turned on a strobe light later performances began with a stern announcement forbidding cameras new york may be a tough town but it still loves a star this very fact that baryshnikov alone sells tickets has led some writers to ask where white oak would be without him but such questioning implies that all baryshnikov does at white oak is dance which is not the case it was he who selected this largely excellent company he also chose and pays for the superb sixperson musical ensemble headed by michael boriskin that accompanies the troupes performances live music is now a rarity at american modern dance performances finally baryshnikov is the one who put together white oaks repertory and it is stamped all over with his ideas his history baryshnikov defected from the soviet union in 1974 because he wanted to dance new roles not just swan lake and giselle but in fact he spent most of his early years in the west performing the classics for that is what audiences wanted to see him in twyla tharp created a number of brilliant jazzbased dances for him and he put in guest appearances with various modern dance companies still he had a hard time breaking out of the prince track and this left him with an extreme reverence for american modern dance he has made white oaks recent repertory a showcase for that tradition with works by graham hanya holm jane dudley paul taylor david gordon meredith monk in the process he has saved some lovely pieces such as holms jocose from oblivion for the new york season he added a merce cunningham piece the 1970 signals signals looks vaguely like a weekend party people are lounging around in chairs one by one they come forward to dance introspective solos and duets then they return to the group it is as if we were seeing their public lives upstage their private lives downstage in white oaks hands signals did not have quite the same highozone purity as when it is danced by its home troupe but that is always the case when a cunningham piece is set on another company and the lyric power of white oaks rendition is a testament to the strength of cunninghams work but baryshnikov does not just restage modern dance he commissions it his success is this department is mixed new to the repertory this season were works by two young choreographers kevin oday a white oak dancer presented the sweettempered and wellmade quartet for iv to music by kevin volans and joachim schlomer director of germanys ulm ballet contributed behind white lilies an agonisingly boring work in which to judge from their stabbing palsied movements the sixperson cast underwent some extreme hardship the decline of the west the crisis of modern belief to the accompaniment of schonbergs string trio the most important commission of the season however was jerome robbinss suite of dances a solo for baryshnikov to four movements from bachs suite for solo cello played onstage by wendy sutter and this was a real little beauty like much of robbinss work it is about the relations between natural movement and dance movement but in the relations that robbins creates going for example from what looks like any old hop to a pas de chat to a stag leap to a grand jete we seem to see ballet flowering before our eyes for the first time this illusion is abetted needless to say by the fact that the dancer is baryshnikov at 46 he still has a thousand steps and a line so beautiful that it brings tears to your eyes but what this dance showcased was his musical imagination the sheer breadth of his response to music comic tragic puckish misterioso and his ability through steps in time to conjure those states into being this was not a solo it was a duet for baryshnikov and js bach staged by a third master robbins if baryshnikovs fame is what sells tickets to white oak the tickets are worth every penny the forthcoming white oak tour includes italy milan april 1321 reggio emilia april 23 florence april 28 then from may through july the us and canada philadelphia minneapolis chicago vancouver and other cities
