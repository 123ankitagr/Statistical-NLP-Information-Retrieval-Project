Nine West , the US footwear group that made a Dollars 425m unwanted bid approach for US Shoe 's footwear business earlier this year , said it had won agreement to buy the division for Dollars 600m . The claim was made after the stock market closed on Friday . US Shoe confirmed that it had conducted confidential discussions with Nine West , but denied that an agreement had been reached . US Shoe is a specialty retailer of women 's clothing , optical goods and footwear with about 2,200 stores and annual sales of about Dollars 2.7bn . Its lacklustre earnings record has put it under pressure to improve its performance . Nine West , a rival of US Shoe , designs and sells women 's fashion shoes and has annual sales of about Dollars 550m . It first approached US Shoe in July with a proposal that US Shoe should spin off its clothing and optical businesses and merge its footwear business with Nine West 's . However , US Shoe 's board rejected the idea . Soon afterwards , Nine West publicised details of the approach in what appeared to be an attempt to generate support for the plan from US Shoe's shareholders , so putting pressure on the company 's board to reconsider . On Friday , Nine West said it was offering Dollars 600m in cash for US Shoe's footwear business plus warrants to purchase 1.85m Nine West shares at an exercise price of Dollars 35.50 a share . The warrants would have a term of seven years and one warrant would be issued for every 25 issued US Shoe shares . Mr Vincent Camuto , co-chairman and president of Nine West , said US Shoe would provide a 'terrific ' fit and the acquisition would benefit Nine West shareholders from the outset . US Shoe said it would not make any further comments on the negotiations until such time as a definitive agreement had been reached .
