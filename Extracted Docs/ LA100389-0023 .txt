The House faces a showdown vote today on the 1988 catastrophic illness insurance law . The law 's author , Rep. Pete Stark ( D-Oakland ) , predicted that lawmakers would vote to abolish the controversial income-based supplemental premium that was to have funded many additional benefits in the biggest expansion of Medicare since its inception in 1966 . Stark , who drew up the Catastrophic Health Insurance Act , plans to push an amendment to maintain some of the law 's benefits . Some senior citizen groups , some House Democrats and most House Republicans support repeal of the law . `` It 's going to be a very close vote '' between repeal or scaling back the program , Stark said . House Speaker Thomas S. Foley ( D-Wash. ) accused President Bush of not doing enough to persuade House Republicans to back the Administration position against repeal .
