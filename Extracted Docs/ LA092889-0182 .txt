President Zine Abidine ben Ali on Wednesday fired his premier , who had expressed growing opposition to Ben Ali 's reform moves . The president named Justice Minister Hamed Karoui to replace Hedi Baccouche , the government announced . `` A new post will be found for Baccouche , '' said a statement from the president 's office without elaboration . Baccouche , a personal friend of the president , was named to lead the government immediately after the palace coup Nov. 7 , 1987 , in which Ben Ali ousted President Habib Bourguiba . However , the two men had grown progressively further apart recently as Ben Ali sought to put through his own program .
