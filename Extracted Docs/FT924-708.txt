EMPLOYEES OF the Auto-mobile Association working on Christmas day will receive four times their normal pay rates , Incomes Data Services , the independent research organisation , says . Other companies provide a mix of higher pay and compensatory time off for workers over the festive season , according to an IDS survey of practices including holiday pay , compensation for working on public holidays , restrictions on the timing of holidays and carrying over unused entitlement from one year to the next . IDS says many of those taking a break over the Christmas period are doing so because part of their annual holiday must be taken at this time . Many companies - including Rockware , Black & Decker , Clarks Shoes , Michelin and Wiggins Teape - require three days of holiday to be taken at Christmas in addition to bank holidays . Others require longer holiday periods at Christmas - eight days at Silentnight Beds , one week at Hotpoint and up to five days at Fisons Pharmaceuticals . Ford UK , which closes its plants over Christmas , is giving blue-collar workers two extra days off because of the recession and falling demand . Most companies are reluctant to allow employees to carry over unused holidays into the following year and few companies permit employees to 'cash in ' unused days . The Institute of Directors suggests in a survey that most British companies are not making radical changes to their Christmas working patterns this year . The institute said more than half of companies would remain open for business between Christmas and the new year - 64 per cent of manufacturing companies planned to close plants , although 41 per cent of these would have sales and marketing staff at work .
