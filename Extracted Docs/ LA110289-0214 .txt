A Soviet submarine became ensnared in the net of a Norwegian fishing trawler today but was freed when a stormy sea tore open the net , a defense official said . Navy Capt . Stig Morten Karlsen of the Norwegian Supreme Defense Command said neither vessel had been in danger . Darkness and the storm in the Barents Sea made it impossible for the crews to go on deck to free the 2,000-ton conventional submarine , and the crews had expected to spend a rough night entangled together . But the force of the storm did the job for them , tearing the fishing net to pieces under the weight of the submarine . Neither ship suffered serious damage .
