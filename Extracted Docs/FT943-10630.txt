The Japanese subsidiary of Asea Brown Boveri , the Swiss-Swedish company , has been billed for additional taxes of Y1.1bn ( Pounds 7.1m ) by the Japanese tax authorities . ABB Gadelius , the Japanese unit of ABB , is accused by the National Tax Agency of failing to report Y2.5bn it forwarded to related companies as a donation , which is taxable under Japanese law . According to ABB Gadelius , in 1991 the company invested Y2.5bn in a holding company acquired to oversee car telephone marketing operations in northern Europe . But the market environment for car phones became difficult and ABB Gadelius handed over the company to its executives for an insignificant sum the following year . The Y2.5bn it forwarded to the company was reported to Japanese tax authorities as an extraordinary loss on an overseas investment . The Japanese tax agency , however , determined the loss was in fact a donation aimed at supporting a related company and that therefore ABB Gadelius , which reported a loss in the year to December 1992 , had in fact made a profit of Y2.1bn . The move highlights the growing inclination of the Japanese tax authorities to take a hard line against foreign companies operating in Japan . The national tax agency in Japan has alleged that many foreign companies under-report earnings to minimise their tax bills . Ciba-Geigy , the Swiss pharmaceuticals group , has also been told it would have to pay an extra Y5.7bn in taxes for 1990 to 1993 , while Coca-Cola is having a penalty of Y15bn imposed . Other large companies facing additional tax payments include Roche , Hoechst and Du Pont . ABB Gadelius said yesterday it was appealing the ruling .
