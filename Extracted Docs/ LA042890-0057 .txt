Following are The Times ' recommendations for today 's and Sunday 's schedule of the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival , with commentary by the film reviewing staff . Information : ( 213 ) 480-3232 or ( 213 ) 520-2000 . Highly recommended : '' KILLER OF SHEEP '' ( U.S. , 1979 ; Director : Charles Burnett ; AFI Mark Goodson , 2 p.m. ) . This was the film that revealed Charles Burnett as one of our shy , stubborn poets , finding beauty and even hope in the rubble of the inner city . See this , which Burnett shot as well as produced , wrote and directed , for its remarkable performances , particularly Harry Gale Sanders , for its beauty , flashes of wit and amazing tensile strength .
