The Palmdale City Council has tentatively approved an April ballot measure proposing to extend the mayor 's two-year term to four years , even though voters overwhelmingly rejected the same plan in 1986 . With little discussion , Palmdale lawmakers -- including Mayor William ( Pete ) Knight -- voted 5 to 0 Thursday night to put the measure before voters in the April 10 municipal election . The change requires a majority vote . City Administrator Robert Toone Jr. said the longer term would provide more continuity on the council . The mayor now faces reelection every two years , but the four council members serve staggered four-year terms . For years , voters in Palmdale simply elected five council members , who in turn picked a mayor from their ranks . But in April , 1986 , voters by a 70 % margin approved election of the mayor individually . However , in the same election , voters opted by a 76 % margin to give the mayor a two-year term instead of four years . Knight , a record-holding former Air Force test pilot who defeated three challengers to become the first elected mayor in April , 1988 , faces reelection in April . Although some council members disagreed , City Atty . William Rudell said the four-year term would take effect in April if approved by voters .
