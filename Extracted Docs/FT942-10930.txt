on landing at gibraltar airport it is easiest to walk through the frontier into spain if you are in a car you could be delayed a poster warning of very dangerous terrorists greets you and dogs wait to catch a whiff of drugs go a little further and you find the guardia civil parked by the sea binoculars searching for speedboatborne smugglers from morocco just over the border is la linea where for 200 years british servicemen rested from the rocks confined life the closing of the frontier for many years up to 1982 was hard for la linea and the country around moroccans took the jobs spaniards had held and the easy way to the costa del sol from britain then spains biggest market was shut this helped malaga airport but reaching marbella by the old coast road was a nasty and dangerous drive today though the motorway and bypasses make it easy from either airport gibraltar has fewer flights and smaller planes but is probably preferable for places west of marbella and its dutyfree prices are phenomenal there is still unspoilt country close to the border and up in the hills where people suffered badly in and after the 193639 civil war for supporting the republicans cork oaks abound the rock rules the sea view although often it is surrounded by fog beyond and not far away are africas atlas mountains the 1618 hectare 4000 acre sotogrande estate between marbella and gibraltar pioneered smart development on the costa del sol and is now 32 years old its first golf course was completed in 1965 and the second in 1975 wide roads were built and utilities installed from the start today it is a bit like california a mix of mediterranean scrub and lush trees flowers and lawns where the ground has been reclaimed and watered indeed water is not a problem for sotogrande which extracts what it needs from the gaudiaro river that flows through the estate and brings migratory birds the owner of the estate is the sotogrande public company which has at least 20 years more sales in prospect before the estate is full even then it will not be cluttered the main shareholder is carlo de benedettis cofir group like the rest of the costa del sol boom and gloom has been the story of sotogrande the boom years were 197174 and 198387 but the recent decline started late in 1989 a year when 43 per cent of all foreign investment in spain went on property in malaga province by last year prices were 4050 per cent down on 198990 the fall of the pound in september 1992 made matters worse while lower interest rates hit british pensioners the subsequent decline of the peseta now around pta200 to pounds 1 has been some recompense but many homes are for resale along the coast it looks now however as if prices have bottomed many more people are inquiring and some are buying in sotogrande inquire at the sales office elsewhere hamptonsrandalwilliams and bd wood offer a good selection sotogrande slashed prices last year on 43 unsold apartments and only seven are now left at realistic and attractive prices between pta16m and pta336m that has released cash for the first phases of a new inland marina where house prices pta18m to pta29m include the entrance fee for the two beach clubs which are still oldfashioned enough to separate children and adults a mooring costs pta45m to maintain standards the company has decided to stop selling other plots to outside developers and instead is building the houses itself most cost from pta30m to pta40m the cheapest is pta272m and the dearest pta605m they are ideal for the three golf courses and two polo grounds the sport still attracts the british army from gibraltar golf has been a boom sport in spain in the past two decades robert trent jones laid out the sotogrande courses of which the best is valderrama a handsome private club which hopes to host the ryder cup in 1997 the ninehole la canada course is the only municipal layout in spain and there are plans to build another 27 holes making 72 in all sotogrande is not a british enclave about half the sales are to spaniards mostly from madrid and the basque country but the british are nibbling again and the germans now constitute about 15 per cent of the market among the rest are people from hong kong south africa northern italy and morocco an international school follows the british and spanish systems marina puente romano is an apartmentonly development east of sotogrande and just west of marbella next to the puente romano luxury hotel la concha mountain dominates the view on the land side and a neighbouring mosque built by the saudi royal family is a surprise reminder of the moors who occupied southern spain the roman bridge puente romano survives in the hotel garden the 234 apartments are built around three gardens each with its own swimming pool best of the gardens is the japanese the others are persian and andalucian the entrance fee for the topclass onsite tennis club is included in the price of the apartments although serious marketing began only last year 35 per cent are sold already with a mix of buyers similar to sotogrande prices range from pta33m to pta120m for penthouses which have their own private pools on the balcony cheaper units are farther from the sea but the persian garden is only 20m back it had received planning permission and work had begun before a law was passed that all new buildings must be 100m back basement parking and storerooms are extra while the monthly community charge includes water close by is marbella now a much cleaner town thanks to its controversial mayor jesus gil y gil who has tackled its drugs and crime image with gusto the old part particularly is well worth an hour or twos meandering further information in spain dialling code from the uk 01034 hamptons and b
