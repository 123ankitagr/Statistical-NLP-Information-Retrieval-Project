star trek has a lot to answer for the popular science fiction television and film series first shown in 1966, set high expectations for computers that could be controlled by talking to them and having them talk back although it has taken a quarter of a century science fiction is now rapidly becoming reality within two years most personal computers will come with speakers a microphone built-in sound processing cd-rom players and operating system-level sound software until recently however there have been few business applications available to take advantage of these sonic pc appendages two promising areas that are emerging are command and control and voice annotation both offer improved efficiency over keyboards and computer mice and could help to make pcs much easier to use voice command and control enables pc users to speak commands to the computer rather than typing them the advantages are clear but the drawback of this technology is that it requires the user to spend a long time training the pc sound system to recognise his or her voice even when the system has been trained it can often be disrupted by background noise if someone is using the photocopier the fax machine is beeping or the air-conditioning has just been switched on the pc may get confused this problem can be minimised by wearing a telephone operator-style headset that includes headphones to listen to the sound system and a wrap around unidirectional microphone that sits only inches from your lips recognition under these circumstances is actually quite good you will however have to get used to the idea of being tethered to your pc get up quickly and you find your headset microphone and anything else you may be wearing from the neck up being dragged off your face not to mention the complications of confusing a telephone headset and the one being used for voice recognition the second big area where voice is expected to make inroads is that of document voice annotation this is where users can add voice notes to computer documents the idea is that voice annotation of documents provides a quick and easy way of making comments about the content of the documents without the comments having to become part of the textual or graphic content of the document thus changes can be requested to a document without users having to type out those changes voice annotation is expected to be particularly useful in situations where a number of people might be collaborating on preparation of a single document by using voice annotation as the document is passed around the workgroup over an electronic mail system the project co-ordinator can make all the changes at once without having to worry about using specialised versioning software to keep track of them voice annotation could also be useful in making confidential comments about financial figures in spreadsheets or making comments on marketing presentations before they are completed any situation where in the past you might have dictated a note to be typed up and attached to a document is a candidate for voice annotation if speech-embedding technology continues to use better compression so that messages do not take up as much disc space or hog the network and voice command systems can further improve on their accuracy of recognition while cutting down on the training time of the system then pc users may soon have the power of a starship commander
