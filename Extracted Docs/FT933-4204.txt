the southeast asian region encompassing south korea taiwan and the asean block has become an important force within the global automotive industry and is providing the worlds vehicle and components manufacturers with some of the strongest growth rates and most substantial business opportunities to be found anywhere in the world during the 1990s the current boom in vehicle output is set to continue apace in the wake of rapidlygrowing local demand and the development by a number of companies of important export markets from a total output across the region of 29m vehicles in 1992 19m passenger cars and 1m commercial vehicles production is expected to increase substantially into the early years of the next century and beyond the recentlypublished financial times management report the emerging asiapacific automotive industry growth and opportunities from south korea to turkey which examines this sector in some depth is for example forecasting that by the year 2002 some 46m passenger cars and 28m commercial vehicles a year could be produced in south korea taiwan thailand malaysia indonesia and the philippines according to this report particularly strong growth is identified as likely in the automotive industries of taiwan thailand and the philippines in the latter country from a very small base level of a few tens of thousands of units for the 10year period up to the year 2002 growth in south korean vehicle manufacturing is also likely to be substantial over the next decade especially if plans by one or more participants in that industry for the establishment of overseas plants come to fruition vietnam which is expected to enjoy rapid economic growth in the foreseeable future is also expected to emerge as a producer so far the motor vehicle industries of taiwan and the asean block have been largely dominated by japanese multinationals although opportunities have existed for american and european automakers and will indeed continue to present themselves over the coming years of taiwans current tally of 10 vehicle manufacturers in early 1993 eight assemble japanese makes and three american or european models one company yeu tyan machinery manufacturing assembles both daihatsu and peugeot vehicles despite heavy japanese involvement in the taiwanese automotive industry however ford has managed to develop the leading position within this sector in 1992 the ford lio ho motor company in which ford motor company has a majority shareholding accounted for more than a quarter of total vehicle output in taiwan and is planning an increase in production in the 1980s another western opportunity in taiwan is in the process of being realised volkswagen vans are to be produced by the ching chung motor company from late 1993 in thailand several makes of european vehicles are assembled in modest quantities by local companies although general motors is thought to be considering the recommencement of assembly operations in conjunction with the bangchan general assembly company gm withdrew in 1978 from assembly in that country the excellent potential of the thai motor vehicle market could lead several other western carmakers to reevaluate opportunities as in thailand the malaysian motor vehicle assembly sector is almost totally dominated by japanese models although seven european makes of passenger car and one american were assembled in 1992 in very low quantities several other such operations are currently either starting up or planned in addition the official first and second national car projects involve respectively mitsubishi and daihatsu although it is not inconceivable that an opportunity for a western luxury car manufacturer could present itself at some stage in the future should a third national car project ever be formulated the position in indonesia is little different from that in thailand and malaysia although general motors has been negotiating with two local companies for the establishment of further vehicle assembly agreements within the small vehicle assembly industry of the philippines mercedesbenz in march 1993 received approval from the board of investments for the assembly of two models by the commercial motors corporation under the newlyopened luxury car category of the car development programme
