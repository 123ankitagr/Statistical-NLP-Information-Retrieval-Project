rum producers have rejected an eu plan to maintain import quotas on dark traditional rum until the year 2001 while abolishing the quota on light rum from 1996 the producers most of whom are in the caribbean want all eu import quotas on rum abolished by january to end shortages of the spirit in europe maintaining the dark rum quota was requested by the french government which has consistently objected to any increase in rum imports fearing damage to the rum industry in its overseas territories mainly martinique guadeloupe and reunion caribbean producers view this as a setback to their efforts to increase sales in europe beyond their current annual quota of 240000 hectolitres the european commission had earlier proposed a quota of 20000 hectolitres per year on rhum agricole which is made from sugar cane juice and produced mainly in the french overseas territories while being opposed to any quota the west indies rum and spirits producers association would have no objection to such a quota on rhum agricole if it is deemed necessary for the french departments said the caribbean producers traditional rum however is made from sugar cane molasses not juice and is an important part of rum exports to the eu to suggest that a quota should be maintained on this type of rum is entirely contrary to the spirit of the overall abolition of the quota system and would seriously damage existing markets for traditional rum in europe the association said the row is the latest between rum producers and the eu over access to the market the producers have claimed for the past two years that the eu has not done enough to prevent a shortage of the spirit in europe by increasing the rum import quota and then abolishing it the shortage is caused by the eu failing to honour its obligation under the lome convention the trade and aid treaty between the eu and the african caribbean and pacific acp countries to increase the quota in line with rising consumption according to the caribbean producers the quota for the current year july to june will be exhausted by end of december by october 7 there remained 152817 hectolitres to complete the quota with peak demand expected at christmas producers fear that their markets in europe which they claim are highly pricesensitive will be destroyed by early quota shipments to satisfy demand to be followed by a shortage and then by highpriced product after the imposition of customs duties for shipments not covered by the quota the rum quota has now reached a level of chaos where it is destroying the markets which the producers have painstakingly built over the years the association said before the lome convention there were no quotas but rum was subject to duty with the first lome agreement france insisted on a quota for duty free imports as demand rose rum producers twice requested an increase in the quota neither was granted mainly because of french pressure the just equitable and only solution is now to bring the quota abolition date forward by one year to january 1 1995 any measure short of this will inevitably contribute to the disarray of the community rum markets said the producers association eu quota for acp rum hectolitres 198788 172000 198889 172000 198990 172000 199091 192000 199192 200000 199293 220000 199394 240000 199495 240000 source west indies rum and spirit producers association
