Bo Jackson wo n't quit baseball to play full time for the Raiders just because he lost his salary arbitration . `` There is no bitterness on Bo 's part , and no change in Bo 's football or baseball plans , '' agent Richard Woods said . Jackson , who led the team in home runs and runs batted in and was most valuable player of last year 's All-Star game , asked for $ 1,900,001 and the Royals offered $ 1 million -- the biggest gap in arbitration history .
