A major Japanese oil refining company says it has developed an artificial , contamination-free method of making the blood protein albumin . Masanori Suzuki , head of genetic engineering for the Tonen Corp. , said in an interview Wednesday that the technique is the first to synthesize human albumin with an authentic cell structure . The protein , now commonly extracted from donated blood , is used to treat burn victims and people with albumin deficiency . Suzuki said albumin taken from human blood is sometimes contaminated with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome virus or other disease-causing agents . Synthetic albumin , however , presents no risk of contamination . Tonen aims for full-scale production in three to five years .
