China will freeze the number of vehicle assembly plants until 1996 under a new automotive policy to be unveiled soon , the official Business Weekly reported at the weekend . The policy , sketchy details of which were published , lays down local content rules and sets out a blueprint for the industry 's development beyond the year 2000 . It appears to close the door , for now , on foreign makers which do not already have ventures . Foreign manufacturers involved in the assembly of vehicles in China include Volkswagen of Germany , Citroen and Peugeot of France , Chrysler of the US , and Daihatsu , Suzuki and Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan . Conspicuous by their absence are the larger Japanese manufacturers , including Toyota , Nissan , Honda and Mitsubishi . The Japanese were slow to respond to opportunities in China , preferring to rely on exports . The moratorium on new plants is aimed at allowing local industry to consolidate after recent rapid changes , including the entry of a number of foreign manufacturers . Local content rules laid down in the policy call for 40 per cent locally sourced parts for new ventures rising to 60 per cent after three years , according to Business Weekly . China produced 234,000 cars in 1993 and plans to increase output to 350,000 this year . Imports reached 310,000 units in 1993 but this almost certainly understates the number of vehicles entering China as smuggling is rife .
