fearful of becoming irretrievably ensnared in china's web taiwan is attempting to slow development of cross-strait ties to win time to build support for its attempts to rejoin the international community in its first white paper on china policy to be released today the government is expected to advocate a go-slow approach to the rapprochement launched with historic talks between the two sides in singapore in april 1993 after seven years detente the paper comes amid a sharp escalation in cross-strait tensions since the march 31 deaths of 24 taiwanese tourists in china's zhejiang province while taiwan business backs closer ties with china most taiwanese remain profoundly distrustful of beijing's leaders the tourist killings played into the hands of president lee teng-hui who is using the incident to further his agenda of getting the world to recognise taiwan as an independent sovereign state observers say it is rumoured among taipei politicians that shortly after mr lee became president following the death of mr chiang ching-kuo in 1988, opposition leaders asked him to seek formal taiwanese independence from china mr lee is said to have replied just give me time the story may be apocryphal but mr lee's record speaks for itself the taiwan-born agricultural economist built up a power base from virtually nil presided over a transition to democracy and in early 1993 shoved off the political stage the military-backed mainlanders who ran the country for over 40 years weeks later he launched a campaign to rejoin the un which taiwan left in 1972, after that body switched recognition to beijing in the past year he and his ministers have globe-trotted constantly trying to drum up international support for entry into the un and other multilateral bodies from which taiwan has long been excluded because of china's objections taipei maintains full diplomatic relations with 29 countries beijing threatens to break off ties with any country which formally recognises taipei as a permanent member of the un security council it can veto taiwan's entry but mr lee's tactics are causing consternation not only in beijing which views the island as a renegade province but also in washington taiwan's closest ally and benefactor taiwan has turned into a kind of frankenstein's monster observes mr parris chang a lawmaker from the pro-independence opposition democratic progressive party dpp the us fostered taiwan's democratic development and some might say the policy worked too well now the us has to live with the consequences the us strategy seems to be simply to wait the clinton administration recently completed a comprehensive review of us policy toward taiwan the first in 15 years minor though symbolically important changes in the us stance are expected to be announced shortly but there will be no change in the us's one-china' policy dating from the late 1970 s acknowledging beijing's claim over taiwan taiwan now experiences a cacophony of views on the island's identity and future the debate is further shrouded by a haze of rhetoric emanating from the government because china threatens to use force should taiwan declare independence the ruling nationalist party or kuomintang persists in larding its assertions that the republic of china on taiwan is a sovereign state with dubious claims that its transitional two-china policy is a interim measure whose ultimate goal is reunification the republic of china on taiwan is already an independent nation by whatever definition says mr hanson chien the kmt spokesman there's no need to antagonise the prc and invite a war public opinion is divided a government-commissioned survey in late june found 12 per cent of taiwanese support independence 21 per cent support reunification and 56 per cent prefer to maintain the status quo a gallup poll conducted shortly after the tourist killings showed support for independence at an all-time high of 27 per cent china should realise the only reason more people don't openly support taiwan's independence is because they are afraid china will attack not because they want reunification says ms maysing yang head of the dpp's foreign affairs department about the only matter on which there is a national consensus is that taiwan should rejoin the un and is it on this aim that president lee appears to have staked his hopes ultimately the us will play a decisive role in taiwan's future says mr wang chien-shien of the kmt-breakaway chinese new party it is in the us's long-term interest to have an independent taiwan some day when it suits their purposes the us will play the taiwan card against china now the time is not mature by march 1996 at the latest taiwan will hold direct presidential elections for the first time mr lee's popularity makes him likely to win should he run it is easy to dismiss a country whose leader was installed by a waning military dictatorship but harder to exclude one whose leader is democratically elected
