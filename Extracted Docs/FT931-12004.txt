representatives of the advertising and tobacco industries yesterday condemned as fallacious and inadequately researched a government report that says tobacco advertising plays a significant role in encouraging people to smoke gary mead writes the criticism came from the advertising association and the tobacco advisory council which represents the main tobacco manufacturers in its response to the report the association said it had used invalid evidence and had ignored international research that contradicted the reports conclusions it said the report reviewed only a small fraction of the evidence on the subject of the effect of tobacco advertising on tobacco consumption ignores the extensive literature relating to the basic question of how advertising actually works arrives at sweeping and unjustified conclusions based on a limited and incomplete review of the available evidence the association quoted a 1984 world health organisation study of smoking behaviour among schoolchildren in norway and finland where tobacco advertising was banned and austria and the uk where it was not it concluded a difference in smoking habits might have been expected no such systematic differences are found the tobacco advisory council suggested in its response that the generally accepted view of researchers was that children who smoked became aware of advertising while children who did not smoke ignored it in the uk about pounds 60m annually is spent on tobacco advertising in the press and on posters
