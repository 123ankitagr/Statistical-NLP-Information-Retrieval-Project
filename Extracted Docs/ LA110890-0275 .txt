westside schools just got their report cards results of how well their students performed on the california assessment program tests results were mixed and so were the responses of local administrators coeur dalene avenue school in venice got test scores that might have induced apoplexy in beverly hills whose schools routinely rank among the states best but although coeur dalene ranked in the bottom half of california schools principal beth g ojena said she felt pretty good about the scores as she pointed out students at the venice elementary school a quarter of them homeless and a third newly arrived immigrants showed slight to significant gains over last year in all areas tested reading written expression and mathematics coeur dalene sixthgraders did better than the los angeles unified school district average ojena attributed some of the schools improvement to the donation last year of a writingtoread laboratory that helps the youngest students get a good foundation in language skills she also noted that the school which has one of the highest homeless populations in the country received a $ 50000 grant from the weingart foundation that allowed it to hire a tutor for its transient students tutoring is especially important for homeless students ojena said learning is sequential she pointed out and homeless students often drop out of a particular school sometimes for as long as a year according to the principal writing has become a schoolwide priority teachers try to have students write daily whatever they are studying students also correct each others written work as a way of developing editorial skills ojena said she believes that performance on the cap tests has to be viewed in context for a student who is preoccupied with adjusting to a new culture and mastering english the tests may not be especially relevant its not that its not important she said it is but when we test across the board its irrelevant to a lot of the kids and thats why they test as low as they do given the complex needs of the student body she said sometimes its incredible to me we do as well as we do other administrators also urged that cap scores be viewed in context vera jashni assistant superintendent for educational services for the culver city unified school district said cap scores can be a useful measure of how a school is doing but only if other measures are also evaluated when you take any test in isolation thats not good she said its only one part of the picture and youve got to take the whole picture into consideration culver citys scores changed little from last years placing the district near the middle statewide jashni said her district looks at several measures in evaluating how well a school is performing in addition to looking at cap scores in written expression for instance the district may also evaluate portfolios that contain examples of students writing over a period of time jashni said culver city does no special preparation for cap testing besides notifying parents and giving students the usual pretest advice get a good nights sleep eat breakfast and try to relax additionally she said the district hopes test day wont be too hot or rainy either one brings down scores how to read the scores these are results of the california assessment program test for third sixth and eighth grades state officials say the scores are intended to provide a way to assess schoolwide academic performance students do not receive individual scores schools are listed alphabetically by district scores are scaled between approximately 100 and 400 although a few scores may be higher or lower a schools scores may be compared to district and state averages for example if the third grade at your school scored 295 in math and the state average is 283 children at your school are performing at a higher level than most thirdgraders statewide in general a fluctuation of 10 points or less should not cause alarm although state education officials say that the margin of error varies depending upon the size of the school students in grades three and six last spring were given multiplechoice tests in reading written language including grammar and spelling and mathematics last springs eighthgraders were tested in reading math historysocial sciences and science eighthgraders also took an essay test to assess their writing skills results of the essay test are expected next month in some cases a specialized or magnet school has its campus on the grounds of a regular school state officials have combined the scores so separate results are not available sample question for sixthgraders illustrative social studies passage in 1860 a midwestern stagecoach company let people know about an exciting new plan which would affect our entire country the company planned a faster mail service to california the pony express which would deliver the mail in 10 days or less strong young men were the riders buffalo bill was one of the famous ones these men had to have courage every day they faced many kinds of danger they had been told remember you travel alone and the country is wild and rugged you may be cold hungry wet and tired but you must go on the mail must go through and it did go through over the saddle of the pony express horses was hung a leather blanket or mochila in the four pockets of it were the tissuethin letters five dollars was the usual price for sending a letter the route cut directly across from missouri to sacramento each rider rode nonstop for about 100 miles and then a new rider took over the horses used were chosen for speed and were changed every 10 miles quickly the mail was thrown over the saddle of the fresh horse much like a relay race horses were saddled and ready to go at every station with a leap the rider was in the saddle and off like the wind illustrative test questions what do you think would usually happen when the rider reached sacramento a he would go to new york b he would eat and rest c he would brand horses d he would meet buffalo bill the mochila used by the pony express rider can best be compared to the a sleeping bag used by the camper b sandpaper used by the carpenter c mail pouch used by the mail carrier d pen used to write and letter you can conclude from the passage that a someone at each station prepared a fresh horse for the rider b buffalo bill was bored by the pony express c the worst danger was from the cold d few people ever heard about the pony express 1990 cap scores beverly hills unified district average 3rd grade
