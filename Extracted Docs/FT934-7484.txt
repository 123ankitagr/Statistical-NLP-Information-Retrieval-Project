So where exactly is the much-trumpeted British supermarket war taking place ? Certainly not in the advertising trenches , where the battle more closely resembles formal jousting than tooth-and-nail struggle . Take the latest advertising campaigns by J Sainsbury and Safeway . Sainsbury 's has recently cut the price of 300 popular own-label products . Naturally , arch-rival Safeway has quickly followed suit . But this is a war of total emulation . So , Sainsbury launched its price-cuts with the slogan 'Sainsbury 's - essential for the essentials ' . Meanwhile , Safeway 's breathtaking innovation was : 'Safeway - low prices on everyday essentials ' . We are further informed that Sainsbury 's gives 'low prices every week ' and Safeway offers 'everyday low prices ' . Ah , the whiff of cordite among the shopping trolleys . . .
