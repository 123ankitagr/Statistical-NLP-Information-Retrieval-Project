The Santa Ana City Council on Monday gave the owners of a 10-unit apartment building involved in a rent strike 60 days to renovate stairs and a balcony or face having the property declared a public nuisance and repaired by the city -- at their expense . Nick O'Malley , an attorney for landlords James B. Isbill and Bonnie P. Isbill , said his clients intend to begin repairs as soon as they receive building permits from the city . The two-story building at 607 E. Washington Ave. has four units vacant and six occupied by low-income families . All of the residents might have been forced to move had the city declared the building a nuisance . In August , an attorney appointed by the city declared that the outside stairs and balcony were so rotten that the building posed a danger to residents . Attorney Calls Building Unsafe In a report to the council , attorney Keith C. Monroe said the apartment building is unsafe . `` Credible evidence demonstrated , '' Monroe wrote , `` that the stairs located on the front of the building . . . are and have been for some time badly dry-rotted and deteriorated . They are dangerous for residents and others to use . '' Because of the conditions , tenants have been withholding rent from the owners since 1985 as part of a countywide rent strike movement . The tenants filed a suit against various landlords , demanding better conditions . O'Malley said the owners of the East Washington Avenue building have not made repairs or renovations because of the lack of rent income . O'Malley said the owners had intended to demolish the building in 1984 but could not proceed with the demolition because of the strike .
