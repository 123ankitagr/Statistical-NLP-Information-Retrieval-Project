The Republican National Committee rushed away from the Senate candidacy of former Ku Klux Klan grand dragon David Duke earlier this year . Incoming RNC Chair Bill Bennett , however , has embraced Duke 's platform by scoring Democrats for their support of affirmative action , which he defines as the process whereby whites lose their jobs to less qualified blacks . Duke may have lost the election , but he won the ideological war . If Bennett has his way , the 1992 national election will set middle-class whites against blacks , the sort of struggle Duke has spent his life instigating . Despite The Times ' choice of words , there is nothing `` curious '' about Bennett 's approach . With Willie Horton as the MVP of George Bush 's 1988 campaign , and Sen. Jesse Helms ' success invoking the issue this fall , Bennett apparently hopes the Duke strategy will distract an angry electorate from its economic woes . Democrats and Republicans should follow The Times ' lead by exposing Bennett 's assault for what it is , and reminding Americans of the profound benefits of diversity at all levels . JOHN B.
