'' Born on the Fourth of July , '' `` Glory , '' and `` When Harry Met Sally '' -- with five nominations each -- were the clear favorites this year among the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , which announced the nominees for its annual Golden Globe Awards Wednesday morning in Beverly Hills . Following close behind with four nominations each were 'Dead Poets Society , '' `` Do the Right Thing '' ( tapped by the L.A. Film Critics as the year 's best picture ) , and Disney 's animated fairy tale , `` The Little Mermaid . '' On the television side , NBC 's `` L.A. Law '' walked away with eight nominations , while NBC 's `` Cheers '' received four , and ABC 's `` thirtysomething '' -- which won last year 's Golden Globe Award for best dramatic series -- earned three . The most popular TV miniseries or made for TV movies were `` Lonesome Dove , '' with four nominations , and `` Roe vs. Wade , '' with three . The Golden Globe Awards , which will be handed out Jan. 20 , often provide a good indicator of what direction the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will take in awarding its coveted Oscars each year . In the past 11 years , eight Golden Globe winners in the dramatic film category -- including last year 's winner , `` Rain Man '' -- went on to win Academy Awards for best picture . The 84 Hollywood-based foreign reporters who voted did shut out a handful of films considered possible Oscar candidates , including two Holocaust-themed films , `` Triumph of the Spirit '' and `` Enemies , a Love Story , '' whose director Paul Mazursky was named the year 's best director last week by the New York Film Critics Cirle ; Kenneth Branagh 's widely acclaimed `` Henry V , '' and Phil Alden Robinson 's baseball fantasy , `` Field of Dreams . '' The latter omission is not surprising because , as a rule , baseball films are rarely popular overseas -- `` Field of Dreams '' was no exception at the foreign box office . The Golden Globe nominees for best dramatic picture were `` Born on the Fourth of July , '' in which Tom Cruise portrays Vietnam vet Ron Kovic ; Woody Allen 's morality play , `` Crimes and Misdemeanors '' ; `` Dead Poets Society , '' starring Robin Williams as a teacher who brings his iconoclastic style to a strict boys prep school ; `` Do the Right Thing , '' Spike Lee 's controversial look at the makings of an urban race riot , and `` Glory , '' a Civil War film about the fate of an all-black regiment . `` Born on the Fourth of July '' also earned a best actor nomination for Cruise , a best director nomination for Oliver Stone , a best screenplay nomination for Stone and Kovic ( on whose life the film is based ) , and a best original score nomination for John Williams . `` Glory 's '' other nominees included Denzel Washington for his supporting role ; Edward Zwick for direction ; Kevin Jarre for his screenplay and James Horner for his original score . Another star of `` Glory , '' Morgan Freeman , was overlooked for that film , but received a best actor nomination for his performance in `` Driving Miss Daisy . '' The Golden Globe Awards touch a broader array of films than the Academy Awards because nominees are named in two separate motion-picture categories -- drama and musical/comedy . `` When Harry Met Sally , '' a best picture nominee in the musical/comedy category , also earned nominations for stars Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal , director Rob Reiner and screenwriter Nora Ephron . The other nominees for best musical/comedy were : `` Driving Miss Daisy , '' which also drew a best actress nomination for Jessica Tandy ; `` Shirley Valentine , '' which garnered a best actress nomination for Pauline Collins ; `` The War of the Roses , '' which brought nominations for co-stars Kathleen Turner and Michael Douglas , and `` The Little Mermaid , '' which earned another three nominations for its music . `` My Left Foot , '' the New York film critics ' choice as the year 's best picture , was ignored in the best dramatic picture category . But its star , Daniel Day-Lewis , was nominated for best actor in a dramatic film . In addition to Cruise and Day-Lewis , the foreign reporters nominated Jack Lemmon ( `` Dad '' ) ; Al Pacino ( `` Sea of Love '' ) , and Robin Williams ( `` Dead Poets Society '' ) in the best actor category for dramatic pictures . The best actors nominated in the musical/comedy category were Crystal , Douglas , Freeman , Steve Martin ( `` Parenthood '' ) and Jack Nicholson ( `` Batman ) . The best actress nominees in the dramatic category were Sally Field ( `` Steel Magnolias '' ) ; Jessica Lange ( `` Music Box '' ) ; Andie MacDowell ( `` sex , lies and videotape '' ) ; Michelle Pfeiffer ( `` The Fabulous Baker Boys '' ) , and Liv Ullmann ( `` The Rose Garden . '' ) Best actress nominees in the musical/comedy category were Collins , Ryan , Tandy , Turner and Meryl Streep ( `` She-Devil '' ) .
