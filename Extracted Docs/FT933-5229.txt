sir while the forum of private business cannot be faulted on its efforts to obtain a statutory right to charge interest on overdue debts mps back right to levy interest on late debts august 19 i wonder whether its energy is correctly directed we already have a right to charge interest on overdue debts and any experienced credit manager will be able to obtain this without the need for parliamentary intervention interest on debt bill may i suggest that if the fpb has sums available to pursue this matter they be directed towards the training of suitable candidates to become effective managers of credit credit management is a relatively new profession which has emerged over the past few years a good credit manager can make all the difference between the success or failure of a business whether we have a statutory right to charge interest on the late payment of debts or not the problem will still be the collection of this money all businesses will end up with is a bigger financial problem unless they have the right people to collect their debts in the first place elaine jenking willow cottage princes road buckhurst hill essex ig9 5 dz
