justice department lawyers have vigorously denied that they have engaged in any misconduct in prosecuting espionage charges against former fbi agent richard miller in january attorneys for miller claimed in a motion filed in us district court in los angeles that charges against him should be dismissed because prosecutors intentionally withheld information that could benefit millers defense but in their response prosecutors maintain that the defense motion is wholly without merit the defense has conveyed a false sense of conspiracy and wrongdoing on the part of the government according to the brief filed by assistant us attys russell hayman and adam schiff the defense motion prosecutors contend is a rehashing of old issues with a new face contentions that were rejected by us district judge david kenyon who presided over millers two trials and the trial of soviet spy svetlana ogorodnikova with whom miller had an adulterous affair in 1984 miller 52 was tried on espionage charges twice with the first trial ending in a hung jury in 1985 the next year a jury convicted him of trading a secret fbi manual to the soviet union for sex money and a burberry trench coat it was the first time an fbi agent had been convicted of espionage the conviction was overturned by the us 9th circuit court of appeals last april and he was released on bail last october miller says he was not a spy but was attempting to revive his lackluster fbi career with an attempt to infiltrate the kgb kenyon removed himself from the case and us district judge robert m takasugi took over millers third trial is scheduled to begin july 10 much of the government response deals with a july 1989 letter sent to fbi director william sessions by a lawyer for former fbi agent john hunt hunt was a witness in both of millers earlier trials the letter urged sessions to investigate possible fbi misconduct in the case the letter claimed that the fbi omitted from hunts investigative reports on the case information that was favorable to miller all of the issues raised by millers january motion have been aired during the earlier trials the prosecutors retorted the defense has long been aware of mr hunts view that his report had been inaccurately summarized and has crossexamined him on this issue in all proceedings the prosecutors also maintain that the fbi conducted an indepth investigation of the case the fact that the fbi did not back away from a prosecution of one of its own agents is a clear testament to its objectivity and singleminded pursuit of the criminal actors the prosecution response states moreover the prosecution motion maintains that much of the information contained in the letter from hunts lawyer lynn sarko of seattle tends to incriminate miller rather than exonerate him and the prosecutors state that they have turned over to millers lawyers all relevant information that could aid his defense in reply joel levine one of millers lawyers asserted that prosecutors have mischaracterized many of the things we were attempting to say he said that a number of issues were raised by the july 1989 letter that the prosecutors did not deal with in their response levine and his cocounsel stanley i greenberg said they plan to file a detailed written reply and hope that judge takasugi will grant a hearing so that the issues they have raised can be further explored before millers trial takasugi is scheduled to hear the misconduct motion on june 11
