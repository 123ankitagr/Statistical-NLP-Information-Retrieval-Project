once the most scorned politician in america former president richard m nixon is now lionized by both liberals and conservatives and is regularly consulted on foreign policy and political strategy by the bush administration and congressional leaders yet nixons latest book in the arena is an eloquent reminder of his profound limitations as a politician and political thinker its callow attempts at selfjustification and its neocold war policy prescriptions reflect a man who is still bedeviled by his past nixon devotes a good deal of in the arena to lame excuses for watergate perhaps assuming that americans memories have dimmed nixon reduces the entire watergate scandal to campaign peccadilloes at the core of the scandal was the fact that individuals associated with my reelection campaign were caught breaking into and installing telephone wiretaps at the headquarters of the democratic national committee in the watergate hotel he writes he either denies or minimizes his role in the sundry assaults on constitutional liberties that the watergate investigation uncovered nixon insists that the numerous wiretaps he ordered were carefully limited and totally legal for reasons of national security we were concerned that leaks might abort our secret china initiatives and our vietnam peace negotiations but the wiretaps were first installed in spring 1969 on nixons national security council and two of his closest aides after the new york times revealed that nixon had begun secretly bombing cambodia the wiretaps had nothing to do with nixons china initiative or peace negotiations the supreme court later ruled that they were illegal nixon dismisses as bizarre and false charges that he ordered massive illegal wiretapping and surveillance of political opponents but in july 1970 nixon approved a massive plan for political repression concocted by aide tom huston that included intensified electronic surveillance of domestic security threats and increased mail coverage these activities were to be coordinated by a new interagency group fortunately j edgar hoover balked at creating a rival to his own agency nixon acknowledges that the watergate coverup was illegal but blames it on his subordinates i made the inexcusable error of following the recommendation from some members of my staff some of whom i later learned had a personal stake in covering up the facts and requesting that the cia intervene nixon says in trying to excuse his request that the cia throttle the fbi investigation of watergate nixon limits his own role to not setting a higher standard for the conduct of the people who participated in my campaign and administration nixon frequently uses the debating technique of denying what has never been charged in order to evade what has already been shown denying any hint of political corruption he writes no one who donated over a million dollars was ever appointed to any ambassadorship what he fails to mention is that quite a few people who contributed somewhat less were given appointments according to j anthony lukas nightmare nixon appointed 13 noncareer ambassadors after his 1972 election who together contributed $ 706000 to his campaign nixon uses a similar debating technique in discussing the use of the internal revenue service irs to harass political opponents he cavalierly defends using the irs against democratic chairman lawrence obrien i see nothing wrong with getting wealthy people to pay their taxes nixon says but nixon doesnt mention using the irs against virtually anyone who crossed his path from a newsday editor to basketball star kareem abduljabbar nixons rendition of his vietnam policy is about as credible as his version of watergate he blames the prolongation of the war on the north vietnamese filibustering the negotiations nixon omits his own role in sabotaging the johnson administrations october 1968 peace overtures his adamant refusal for four years to accept a north vietnamese presence in the south even though it was obvious they could not be dislodged the south vietnamese governments veto of the agreement finally worked out in summer 1972 between national security adviser henry kissinger and the north vietnamese nixon not only defends but recommends as models of decisionmaking the 1970 invasion of cambodia and the brutal and unnecessary 1972 christmas bombing of hanoi he writes that the cambodian invasion saved lives and reduced the communists ability to continue their attacks on our forces not mentioning that the invasion failed utterly in its main objective of unearthing and destroying the north vietnamese headquarters the infamous cosvn supposedly located in cambodia nor that by inflaming domestic opposition the invasion restricted nixons future options far more than it restricted north vietnams as president nixons greatest achievement was to break with the cold war model of a monolithic world communist movement nixon recognized that the united states could use the growing divisions within the communist world to its own advantage by playing china off against the soviet union the problem is that two decades later with communism in ruins and the soviet union turning inward nixon clings to the same geopolitical strategy nixon still believes that the soviet union remains a dangerous threat that must be parried through alliance with china in this book nixon avers that soviet president mikhail gorbachev is not a reformer but a wily brezhnev seeking the same ends through more devious means his musings on gorbachev sound as though they were excerpted from a john birch society newsletter gorbachevs reforms represent little more than crumbs which have fallen from the banquet table gorbachevs goal is not to replace the communist system but to strengthen it the soviet army is stronger than when gorbachev came to power five years ago gorbachevs principal political reform has been to concentrate more power in his own hands than any soviet leader since stalin he has not given up his support for those regimes besieged by anticommunist freedom fighters by the same token nixon insists that the chinese are worthy and valuable allies against the soviet union after the tian an men square massacre nixon called for the bush administration to retain its cooperative relationship with deng xiaoping and chinas other leaders to prevent the soviet union from creating an alliance with china against the united states in this book nixon wildly exaggerates chinas importance to american foreign policy china he writes is the number three political player on the world scene nixon also glosses over chinas retrogression after tian an men square he predicts that after some necessary retrenchment dengs economic reforms will continue and with them will inevitably come renewed pressure for political reforms he portrays deng and disciple li peng the architects of the massacre as being reformers and warns that an american attempt at isolating china will only be grist for the mill of the reactionaries in typical nixon fashion he refutes his critics by attributing to them untenable positions they do not hold after the massacre nixon writes some observers called for the united states to punish chinas leaders by breaking off all relations chinas critics however did not call for breaking off all relations but rather for suspending highlevel contacts above ambassadorial level a far different and more reasonable response and one that nixon might have found more difficult to dismiss like paul nitze and dean acheson nixon was a lot smarter in office than out out of office he has seemed determined to prove his conservative credentials even positioning himself in 1987 on ronald reagans right by opposing the manifestly benign inf treaty he also seems driven by a need to justify his continuing close relations with chinas leaders and his questionable role in persuading the bush administration to take a conciliatory posture after tian an men square nixon is so obsessed with cold war geopolitics that he barely mentions the global issues that will dominate american foreign policy in the next two decades nixon has only the foggiest notion of international economics he devotes a single sentence to economic conflicts with japan many of our trade disputes nixon declares have been politically potent but economically petty if anything the exact reverse has been the case the disputes have had little effect politically but have had enormous repercussions on key american industries like semiconductors and automobiles there are sensible and interesting sections in this book in chapters on temperance recreation public speaking or privacy nixon offers dale carnegielike advice to the young about how to succeed in politics nixon also can display a commendable realism in rejecting proposals for total disarmament or world government but just as nixons greatest achievements as president were overshadowed by his darker side the virtues of this book are dwarfed by its vices
