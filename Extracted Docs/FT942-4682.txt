recent trading successes and indications of political goodwill appear to be breaking down the often intense and historic rivalry between new zealand and its resourcerich neighbour australia australians are showing increasing interest in the economic reform programme in new zealand although it is acknowledged that political realities make it unlikely that some of the tax and labour regulations will find their way into law there investment flows between the countries are growing rapidly spurred by the trade pact closer economic relations cer signed in 1982 cer has been of immense importance to new zealand for decades australia with britain was the major supplier of manufactured goods trade traditionally ran twotoone in australias favour but today it is in balance each country increased its exports to the other by 12 per cent last year new zealanders are pressing australia to further develop the agreement and move towards a fuller integration of the two economies but there was disappointment in may when some australian officials argued that cer has gone about as far as it can the australians refuse to examine issues such as harmonising taxation matching manufacturing standards and freeing up mutual investment options after initial rapid progress aviation reform also appears to have stalled the agreement has allowed air new zealand to establish a hub in brisbane to service the asian market this has proved of immense benefit to the airline and created thousands of jobs in queensland as asian holidaymakers flock in however australians have been slow to use the beyond rights that they gained to new zealand in the reciprocal aviation deal new zealand is anxious to see ansett flying the tasman sea between the two countries both countries seem to be ignoring one of the most delicate issues rules of origin new zealand manufacturers operate in a largely tarifffree environment and can buy raw materials such as plastic cheaply on the world market however australia retains import protection for its own manufacturing goods this situation appears to benefit new zealand manufacturers in selling to australia as it keeps up the price of australian inputs rowland crone president of the new zealand manufacturers federation says action on these issues is a priority and would further strengthen cer trade and economic ties behind mr crones concern are statements by the australian prime minister paul keating who in a visit to thailand last month spoke of extending cer to the six asean nations new zealand officials are also keen to see freer trade between the two blocs however mr crone argues that to compete equably with the dynamic asean countries new zealand and australia must settle the remaining outstanding issues between them over cer political differences became intense in the mid1980s over defence highlighted by new zealands withdrawal from anzus the pact with australia and the us since last year relations have improved following a state visit to new zealand by mr keating who appears to have developed an excellent relationship with the new zealand prime minister jim bolger in many areas apart from trade the ties are growing steadily stronger defence links appear to have improved and there is close liaison on police and crime matters however the australians continue to keep a close eye on new zealand there were grumbles in new zealand after australias april budget many people complained that it contained a tax incentive measure that was expressly aimed at encouraging companies to base their head offices and manufacturing facilities in australia rather than new zealand this followed moves to new zealand by a string of companies to take advantage of the lower tax cost and wage structure a major attraction was the employment contracts act which has introduced greater flexibility in wage bargaining but is labelled an antiunion measure in australia among companies moving to new zealand or expanding there were gillette unilever johnson johnson and alcatel which supplies wiring systems for the australian car industry all use new zealand as a base to supply australia and asia a recent study by trust bank found that major companies were coming to new zealand because of its low inflation it found that costs were being held as industry developed flexibility and said productivity of new zealand industry had risen by 28 per cent in the five years to last december using no more staff or overtime hours a number of new zealand companies are expanding in australia they include pacific star a subsidiary of telecom new zealand which is a major supplier to telecommunications equipment to the queensland government and larger companies and the whitegoods manufacturer fisher and paykel which has built a large plant in queensland the growth of sales to australia has been a factor in the surge of optimism seen recently among new zealand manufacturers business confidence is at its highest level for two decades and the manufacturers federation believes economic growth could touch 6 per cent by june after years of running between zero and 2 per cent a year in the year to december 31 the strengthening new zealand economy led to the creation of 42000 jobs of which 23000 were fulltime positions in manufacturing many more were created in allied industries that service the manufacturing sector the statistics department reported in march that employment in the manufacturing sector was up 97 per cent the strength in manufacturing is spreading through the economy and the extra jobs and spending power is seen as a significant reason for the budget surplus that is expected this financial year yet all is not going new zealands way australia for example is winning the trade war on the food front where it appears to offer cheaper canned and frozen processed items against this new zealanders have done well in light engineering and steel and aluminium fabrication gilbert petersen of the manufacturers federation says that while there is a feeling of confidence in the sector there is no great sense of security with the knowledge that the australians could run rings around us if they wanted to because their larger population leads to economies of scale it is widely believed that any advantages new zealand manufacturers have gained are due to efficiencies learned the hard way through surviving a protracted and deep recession they will battle to keep them and make the best possible use of the cer pact
