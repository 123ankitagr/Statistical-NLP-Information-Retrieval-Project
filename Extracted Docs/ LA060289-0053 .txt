In Australia , where the environment has become a major political issue , Prime Minister Bob Hawke and his 4-year-old granddaughter will appear on a 90-minute program Tuesday called `` Climate in Crisis . '' On the program , Hawke says : `` Sophie 's now 4 . In the year 2000 she will be 15 -- not all that far from adulthood , with her own dreams and aspirations . How successfully she and other children can fulfill their goals depends increasingly on how we look after our environment and how we best use this planet 's natural resources . '' Saving the country 's rain forests and cleaning up beach pollution are among concerns of conservationists down under . ALEENE MacMINN
