Any hopes of establishing 'open skies ' between New Zealand and Australia were dashed yesterday . Transport ministers from both countries acknowledged that a 1992 memorandum of understanding giving Air New Zealand access to Australia 's domestic market from November 1 will not proceed . Mr Laurie Brereton , Australia 's minister , said the accord would now go no further than the existing concessions allowing Air New Zealand to pick up the equivalent of 12 jumbo-jet loads of passengers in Australia each week and take them to another overseas destination . Mr Maurice Williamson , his New Zealand counterpart , conceded the climate had changed since the agreement had been signed , in part because of the planned floatation next year of the Australian government 's remaining 75 per cent stake in its flag carrier , Qantas . Air New Zealand 's entry into the Australian domestic market , as a second competitor alongside Ansett , would almost certainly have disrupted Qantas 's domestic revenue flow . Australia 'froze ' the memorandum unilaterally two weeks ago . There has been speculation that the Australian authorities were keen to encourage a tie-up between Ansett and Air Zealand , thus extending the duopoly which exists in Australian air services across the Tasman .
