burmas ruling military junta has wrongfooted some of its fiercest critics with a steady stream of announcements on political and economic reform over the past six months the state law and order restoration council slorc has released hundreds of political prisoners lifted a night curfew reopened universities eased restrictions on foreign tourists and journalists and reached a tentative agreement with dhaka on the return of thousands of persecuted burmese moslems who sought refuge in bangladesh the generals have also promised to hold a convention on a new constitution in january sought to accelerate a fouryearold economic liberalisation programme and announced the partial privatisation of state factories the changes have sparked agonised debate among diplomats in rangoon who were once united in outrage at burmese human rights abuses there is division between those who favour renewing foreign aid to burma suspended after army suppression of the prodemocracy uprising in 1988 and advocates of continued isolation the isolationists contend that international pressure and burmas shortage of cash is partly responsible for the slorcs reforms they say pressure should be maintained to secure the release of ms aung san suu kyi the detained opposition leader the advocates of renewed foreign aid argue that another uprising would lead to another military crackdown they argue it is better to foster economic growth and encourage the creation of a middle class which could gradually use the political institutions established by the slorc and eventually challenge the power of the military establishment the burmese people themselves appear resigned and they say the slorc is able to loosen its grip because it has stamped out opposition in central burma noone believes that the slorc which ignored the results of a 1990 election in which the opposition national league for democracy won more than 80 per cent of the seats has any intention of yielding power most burmese wishing to share their political views live in terror of informers opposition politicians who have not fled have been jailed or frightened into silence participants at the convention will be vetted by the slorc which is thought to have its own draft constitution ready for rubber stamping without the participation of aung san suu kyi the national convention will be regarded as a hoax by the majority of the burmese people says one burmese doctor in rangoon senior officials acknowledge their distrust of democracy and all but admit that the whole process is windowdressing we are moving towards true democracy democracy in which there will be party pluralism declared col ye htut a de facto government spokesman at a recent meeting with foreign journalists but a moment later he added the solution to problems in this country is not democracy it is national unity however since the general public desire a multiparty democratic system then this must be done by us as if it to underline its determination not to relinquish political control the slorc in october issued six objectives for the national convention one of these stated that the army would have the leading role in future national politics the slorcs economic reforms however have started to take root for the past four years the government has nurtured the private sector and accepted the failure of statecontrolled enterprises under the previous military governments burmese way to socialism mandalay straddling the main trade route from china is booming in the capital rangoon newlyopened private restaurants are thriving and the first private bank has opened its doors local businessmen are already drawing parallels between burma and china where the unchanging nature of the political system has not stopped economic reform or rapid growth more or less they are following the chinese model says one burmese banker the ruling party is still in control but in the economic sphere they are adopting gradual reforms foreign investors are vying to take over and refurbish the countrys stateowned hotels the new pepsicola joint venture is planning to increase production thai and australian entrepreneurs are setting up businesses south korean singaporean and hong kong companies have already established factories to make textiles and electrical goods however formidable obstacles still block the path to burmas international rehabilitation the generals for all their rhetoric are wary of the free market and point fearfully at the destabilising effects of economic reforms in the former communist states of eastern europe potential investors in burma are still deterred by corruption bureaucracy the poor state of transport and communications and the slorcs reluctance to devalue the kyat the local currency which trades on the black market at a twentieth of its official value in addition the slorc does not know what to do about ms aung san suu kyi who won the nobel peace prize in 1991 she has refused to leave the country and remains under house arrest the soldiers standing guard in full public view outside her home on rangoons university avenue are a continuous reminder that although there has been some change there is scope for much more
