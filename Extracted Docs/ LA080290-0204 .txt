Two men have been charged in federal court in San Diego in connection with the seizure of 261 pounds of cocaine allegedly smuggled from Costa Rica . Customs agents , along with members of a task force composed of federal agencies and officials from Southern California law enforcement agencies , arrested the two men last week . Dirk Francis Jennings , 52 , an unemployed U.S. citizen who had been living in Costa Rica , was arrested in San Diego . He was charged Friday with conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with intent to distribute , said Assistant U.S. Atty . John Kraemer . Jennings is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Facility . John Daniel Cornwell Jr. , 42 , a shipbuilder from Manhattan Beach , was arrested last week in Long Beach after agents found the cocaine , worth $ 2 million , in five duffel bags in his car . He was charged Tuesday with the same offense as Jennings . He will be brought to the San Diego correctional facility in a few days , Kraemer said . In addition , a 27-foot fishing boat , which agents believe was used to smuggle the cocaine , was seized in Chula Vista on July 27 , said customs spokesman John Miller . The boat had a registration number but no name . Customs agents have not determined who owns it , Miller said . Miller said the arrests are important because it might signal a change in the route that drug smugglers are using . `` The unique thing was the distance it came from Costa Rica by water , '' Miller said . `` Normally it comes through Mexico . Maybe it 's an indication that drug smugglers are going around Mexico now . '' DEANNA BELLANDI
