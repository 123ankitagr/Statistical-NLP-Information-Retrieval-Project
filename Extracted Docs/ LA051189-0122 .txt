Calling self-styled activist Don Jackson `` psychologically unfit '' to return to his job as a sergeant with the Hawthorne Police Department , city officials announced Wednesday he will be granted a disability retirement . The decision by City Manager R. Kenneth Jue comes more than two years after Jackson , 31 , was placed on temporary disability leave after his allegations of racism against Hawthorne police . Jackson gained national attention in January when a television camera crew filmed him as he was apparently pushed through a plate glass window by a policeman during a `` sting '' operation designed to uncover abuse in the Long Beach Police Department . His retirement will be retroactive to Feb. 3 , the date of a psychiatrist 's report that recommended that he be removed from the force , said Doug Gates , Hawthorne 's employee relations officer . Jackson will receive $ 2,120 a month , 50 % of his sergeant 's pay , from the state Public Employees Retirement System , Gates said . Jackson had received $ 960 a month in temporary disability pay . `` I 'm very relieved , '' Jackson said Wednesday . `` It 's been a burden economically as well as mentally . ''
