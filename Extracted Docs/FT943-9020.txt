the us and north korea announced a breakthrough early today in talks aimed at bringing to an end their dispute over pyongyangs controversial nuclear programme in a joint statement the two sides released an outline agreement that includes a transfer of western nuclear technology to pyongyang in return for north korea freezing its homegrown nuclear programme which is thought to include weapons development the us said it was ready to provide pyongyang with light water reactors up to 2000 mw as soon as possible north korea agreed to halt construction of two graphite reactors near completion and to forego reprocessing of spent uranium fuel rods which the west fears pose a radiation risk the graphite nuclear reactors produce highquality plutonium that can be used in nuclear weapons the two sides said they were ready to establish diplomatic representation in each others capitals as a move toward full normalisation of political and economic relations north korea also reiterated its readiness to remain a party to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt and to allow implementation of its safeguards agreement however several important issues remain to be resolved and us officials were cautious in assessing the impact of the accord the deal would not remove all nuclear bombmaking capacity from north korea pyongyang does not appear to have agreed to demands for full inspection of its nuclear facilities by no means its a final agreement but i think it will underscore some of the sort of areas where theres agreement said ms dee dee myers white house press secretary washington had been trying to win agreement from north korea for 8000 spent uranium fuel rods extracted from a nuclear reactor at yongbyon in may to be shipped abroad for reprocessing perhaps in china or russia but the two sides agreed that the nuclear fuel rods would remain in a cooling pond and not be reprocessed for the time being the us fears the rods pose a radiation risk us officials believe the rods contain enough plutonium to produce up to five nuclear bombs the cia thinks north korea may have already produced two nuclear devices the deal would involve north korea shutting down its graphite nuclear reactors which produce high quality plutonium in return the us would supply technology for a watercooled reactor of the type used in the west these produce poorer quality plutonium which is harder to detonate and are easier to monitor by international observers it is not clear who will bear the dollars 2bn pounds 12bn cost of a large watercooled reactor north korea also wants compensation for ending construction of a new large graphite reactor plutonium that north korea has already produced is not covered by the agreement nuclear conundrum page 3
