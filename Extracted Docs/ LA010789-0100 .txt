japan's powerful economic machine began to tone itself down in observance of the death of emperor hirohito but its factories will continue to hum throughout a period of mourning that seems likely to have a largely cosmetic effect on global business while movies were canceled on some japanese airlines and flight attendants donned more conservative outfits a 60-second period of meditation at toyota's domestic plants was timed to avoid any loss of production on the auto assembly lines the chief economic impact could be felt in the travel industry officials speculated as both corporate and personal travel plans were being canceled or postponed for periods that range from a few days to two months in some japanese corporate board rooms today was the x day that had been anticipated ever since the emperor fell ill last fall contingency plans that business executives had previously refused to discuss were quickly put into effect they included temporary suspensions of advertising campaigns in japan and to a small extent in the united states a mandate for dark conservative clothing and an unofficial ban on entertainment alcoholic drinks and social functions but despite the long period of preparation for hirohito's death the responses varied widely from company to company because it had been 62 years since the japanese have had to so mark an end to an era many were unsure how to respond and it was considered unseemly to plan for the death in any detail before it occurred we are an american corporation this has not happened in the lifetime of most of the japanese in our bank margaret merrett a spokeswoman for sanwa bank california said friday the last time this occured before they weren't born for the most part so they don't remember this is a new experience for them meanwhile japan's pervasive role in the world economy gives the emperor's death a high visibility abroad a concern that japan's u s subsidiaries downplayed by stressing that they are u s firms officials of japanese banks and securities firms u s arms of japanese auto firms and other japanese outposts in this country said it would largely be business as usual we are an american corporation we work on an american calendar and schedule said yutaka nakai general manager at the los angeles office of daiwa securities america an exception all nippon airways canceled the next three days of u s advertising according to kent cooper director of public relations at the los angeles office of hokuhodo advertising america hokuhodo is japan's second-largest advertising agency ana one of the most japanese of japan's airlines also dusted off contingency plans that called for an end to in-flight movies for a week as well as the customary welcome drink for first-class and business-class customers an airway spokesman said and the chief steward was to exchange the usual orange uniform in favor of the more subdued blue outfit worn by the rest of the staff cooper said the cancellation of ana's domestic advertising compared to a planned seven-day suspension in japan was implemented friday under what was known internally as the hirohito ad suspension plan for the thousands of americans who do business with japanese or work for them the death of the emperor raised issues of protocol that brought forth this advice friday american business people should direct their condolences to the consul general of japan in los angeles hiromoto seki the consulate office at 250 e first st 12 th floor will receive condolences monday through thursday between 10 a m and 5 p m where visitors may sign a book of mourning steve clemmon executive director of the japan america society of southern california said the main focus for condolences should be toward japanese government representatives beginning with the consulate general but merrett of sanwa bank said it would be appropriate for american business people to express regrets to japanese business people in writing or in person there is nothing really set down as this is what you have to do she said in japan several major observances have been scheduled for example the tokyo stock exchange's normal half-day saturday trading session was canceled and officials were discussing whether to close the exchange on monday as well said ken suzuki general manager at the los angeles office of nikko securities notified by loudspeaker the fact that hirohito's death occurred as the weekend began will tend to minimize the disruption to the nation's economic life several executives said nissan and toyota the two biggest auto makers planned full factory schedules even through the weekend employees arriving for work saturday morning were notified at most companies by loudspeaker of the emperor's death and were asked to lower the national flags to half-staff and observe one minute of meditation at toyota the observance was scheduled for 10 a m a normal work break time so that no factory production would be lost though the u s operations of japanese firms were generally supposed to be unaffected several companies said they will continue to observe a general ban on large parties and receptions some companies implemented the ban last september when hirohito first became seriously ill merrett of sanwa bank said sanwa will stay open as usual but will observe a 50-day mourning period during which there will not be any large parties or receptions also senior officers in japan will not likely leave japan to visit the united states during this period she said the general slowdown of official economic activity in japan will mean less travel within japan and abroad several executives said tourism is also likely to be affected however no dramatic impact was predicted gene cotter senior vice president of marketing for the hawaii visitors bureau said he thought the effect of reduced visits from japanese tourists to his state will be minimal he said older japanese tourists who were close spiritually to the emperor may postpone trips for a while but the bulk of japanese tourists are younger and less likely to change their plans significantly he said in any event he contended the mourning period may be shorter than the traditional 49 days since government officials were asking people to show restraint only over the next four or five days staff writers bill sing george white linda williams and nancy yoshihara
