North Carolina has refused the Ku Klux Klan permission to join an Adopt-a-Highway cleanup program that would have allowed the group to post its name on signs along a stretch of road running through a black neighborhood . Under the program , the state puts up eye-catching , green-and-white road signs naming the group or business that has pledged to clean the adopted stretch of road four times a year . The klan asked for a 3.4-mile stretch of road on U.S. 158 in Rockingham County about 100 miles from Raleigh through a predominantly black neighborhood .
