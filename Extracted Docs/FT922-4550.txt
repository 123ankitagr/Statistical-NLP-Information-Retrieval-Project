the us forest service is to change its forest management philosophy in a move that could sharply alter logging practices and help to revive indigenous tree species almost wiped out by rapidly-growing softwoods mr dale robertson service chief has instructed regional foresters to start to manage the 191 m acres of national forest under their authority as dynamic and complex eco-systems instead of concentrating on maximising timber production the new policy is to lead to a 70 per cent reduction in clear-cutting where loggers clear an entire area of trees and brush and to a greater use of less intensive logging techniques that leave some trees standing at the moment clear-cutting is used on about a third of the 800,000 to 900,000 acres harvested each year in national forests and accounts for a much higher proportion of timber volume the forestry service also aims to restore traditional north american tree species including east coast hardwoods and the western ponderosa pine which has been largely superseded by faster-growing species such as douglas fir and lodgepole pine forestry officials said reduction of clear-cutting would lead to a short-term drop of about 10 per cent in timber volume harvested but added that volumes would return to their previous levels over time through development that pays attention to variations in tree maturities stable volumes would imply logging on larger acreages this might be difficult because of environmental challenges to logging of any kind on vast areas of national forest land that shelter endangered species of wildlife even so some foresters argue there is ample scope for sustaining volumes by thinning existing forests the exact consequences of the new eco-system in forest management policy are difficult to predict especially as it is by no means clear that mr robertson will be allowed to proceed with his policy change by president george bush he likes to call himself the environmental president but his administration has usually considered timber industry jobs more important than ecological concerns industry officials argue that clear-cutting is not just the cheapest way to harvest trees but also the best way to ensure replanting it's cheaper but it is also often the best way to get regeneration said ms anne heissenbuttel director of forest planning and policy at the national forest products association however mr neil sampson executive vice-president of american forests a conservation organisation says that the robertson memorandum would represent a dramatic shift from the european philosophy of treating forests as agricultural factories by planting acres of single softwood species it's not a non-economic view of forest management it's a view which says people may not be powerful enough or smart enough to replace a natural forest with an artificial forest he said
