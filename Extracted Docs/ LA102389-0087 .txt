The 5-day-old forest fire straddling Orange , San Diego and Riverside counties is expected to be fully contained by late this afternoon , according to the U. S. National Forest Service . `` The rainy weather today really did help us , '' said Audrey Hagen , a spokeswoman for the U. S. National Forest Service , on Sunday . Hagen said the remaining pockets of fire on Sunday were confined to a wooded area in Riverside County , just north of the San Diego County line . About 900 firefighters were on duty Sunday working to extinguish those final blazes , she said . Hagen added that no fires remained active in the Orange County portion of the Cleveland National Forest . The forest fire , which started Wednesday at the Marine Corps ' Camp Pendleton in San Diego County , was 65 % contained by Sunday afternoon , Hagen said . `` We expect 100 % containment by 6 p.m. Monday , '' she said . As of Sunday , the forest fire had burned 10,925 acres in the three counties , Hagen said . She said four firefighters had been injured during the past five days , but none of the injuries was life-threatening . They included a cut knee , a dislocated shoulder , chest pains and a minor burn , Hagen said . The forest service has estimated that the total cost of extinguishing the blaze would be $ 2.5 million , including manpower and equipment . That figure does not include property loss , primarily in trees and shrub , due to the fire . The forest service had no loss estimate yet on the fire 's total property damage . The cause of the fire has been attributed to `` military training '' at Camp Pendleton , Hagen said , adding that she had no information on the exact sort of training that caused the fire to ignite and spread .
