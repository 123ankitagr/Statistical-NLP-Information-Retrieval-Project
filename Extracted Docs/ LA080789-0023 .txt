A small plane whose pilot was spotting schools of fish for a fishing boat crashed into the ocean off Orange County on Sunday , prompting a search by the Coast Guard and Navy for the flier , authorities said . Searchers found a sneaker , a flight plan , an aerosol can and pieces of the aircraft , but no sign of the pilot several hours after the plane nose-dived into the ocean 10 miles southwest of Dana Point . Coast Guard spokeswoman Elizabeth Neely said crews aboard a Coast Guard cutter and patrol boat and two Navy vessels searched for the pilot of the Cessna 172 until nightfall . His name was withheld until relatives could be notified . `` The water in that area is pretty deep , '' she said . `` It 's at least 200 to 400 fathoms , '' about 800 feet to 1,600 feet . The plane is believed to have taken off from Gillespie Field near El Cajon in San Diego County sometime Sunday morning , Neely said . The pilot was working with the commercial fishing vessel Horizon , spotting schools of fish and reporting by radio their position to the boat , whose owner saw the plane crash into the ocean , Neely said . `` There was no fire and no smoke '' coming from the falling plane , Neely said . She said it was believed the pilot was alone in the aircraft . A Federal Aviation Administration duty officer said the pilot did not report having difficulties , and there was no immediate information on what caused the crash .
