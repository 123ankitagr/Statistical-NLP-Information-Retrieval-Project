Joe McNulty 's earliest childhood memories were n't of playing on a swing set with his four older brothers in the back yard of their home in Capistrano Beach . `` We never even had anything like a swing set or a basketball hoop in our yard , '' he said . `` All we did was surf . '' With the pounding waves of the Pacific Ocean only a few feet from his back door , Joe was a reluctant student of the surfing game . But to keep up with his brothers , he had no choice but to learn . `` It was really funny , '' said Brian McNulty , Joe 's brother and a regular on the pro surfing tour . `` We could n't get Joe to surf . I already was surfing in contests . It seemed he had a vengeance against surfing . We kept bugging him and bugging him , but he would n't try it . '' But one day Brian returned from a competition and saw his brother riding a wave . `` I finally gave in , '' Joe said . `` I went out on my own and I got hooked . '' `` Now he 's the most hard-core surfer in the family , '' Brian said . The playful days of youth have come and gone for the McNulty brothers , but not their free spirit . Outsiders view surfing as the last refuge of the free spirit . But for the McNultys , it has been a family bond . `` It was really easy growing up , '' Brian said . `` We all got along pretty good . We all had one thing in common with surfing . We could all relate to each other through that . '' A product of their environment , the McNultys are to surfing in the 1980s what the Wilson brothers were to singing about surfing in the '60s . Brian , 25 , has been in the surfing spotlight the longest . He 's ranked 32nd in the world and is in his fourth year on the Assn . of Surfing Professionals tour . Sean , the oldest brother at 28 , enjoyed modest success on the world tour before retiring in 1984 . He now leases commercial real estate in San Diego . Pat Jr. , 26 , a former top amateur , commutes between Capistrano Beach and Hesperia and works in real estate development . Joe , 19 , and Terence , 21 , represent the family 's new breed of surfers . Terence is in his first year as a pro and Joe is a top amateur . McNulty family reunions are a rarity , which is why this weekend will be special for them . Brian and Terence will participate in the Op Pro Surfing Championships , which start Monday at Huntington Beach . Joe will compete in the Op Junior portion for top amateurs . Pat and Sean will be in town to watch . `` It 's a good time for us because the pro tour is in California , '' Joe said . `` We have n't spent Christmas together for eight years . There 's always one , two or three of us gone . '' But for many years , the McNulty household was full of surfboards and young surfers . `` We grew up in a neighborhood with a lot of famous people in surfing and water sports , '' Brian said . `` Hobie Alter grew up here . A lot of surf stars , like Jerry Lopez and James Jones , stayed at ( neighbor ) Gordon Clark 's house . '' With the brothers off chasing waves and real estate deals , their mother , Mary , lives in peace and quiet in the family 's five-bedroom home in Capistrano Beach . Brian is with the world tour eight months of the year and Joe and Terence live in San Clemente and are busy traveling to area contests . `` It 's been tough on mom , '' Brian said . `` She is n't too happy with us right now because we all left and there 's no one at the house . '' Mary said she 's enjoying the solitude . `` Raising five boys was a snap , '' she said . `` Although it had its moments . I knew what to expect with the boys . After one or two , there were no surprises . Their affinity with the ocean made it much easier to raise them . '' The McNultys ' interest in surfing budded from their father , the late Pat Sr. , who was editor of Surfer magazine from 1967-69 . `` Dad was a complete water man , '' Brian said . `` We had boards , a catamaran and kayaks . '' Pat Sr. died of a heart attack in 1971 , leaving Mary to keep the family together . `` We had a few rough years after dad died , '' Pat Jr. said . `` Mom took over the leadership . She was in charge , but we all helped out . '' Joe was 2 when Pat Sr. died . He turned to the oldest McNulty , Sean , to fill his father 's role . `` He was the elder statesman , '' Joe said . `` He kept us in line when mom could n't . He was at the age he knew he had take responsibility . He was the marshal . '' Brian said his mother gave the brothers `` a lot of room to grow when we were young . '' `` We did n't have any strong curfews or strict upbringing , '' Brian said . `` We had strong morals . We knew right from wrong . '' When they did n't , Mary used a variety of disciplinary actions . After one of Brian 's worst teen-age transgressions , she exiled him to tennis camp in Big Bear during the week of qualifying for the world amateur surfing championships . `` I do n't know how I ever got the guts to do that , '' she said . She even went so far as to ground the boys from the beach . `` She tried that a couple of times , '' Brian said . `` But it did n't work . '' As the boys grew older , they began to develop interests outside surfing . Sean went off to college for two years , then tried the pro surfing circuit . Pat was dabbling in real estate by the time he was 20 . Joe played baseball and surfed with Terence as much as he could . `` Joe and Terence were so close in age it was almost like they grew up as twins , '' Mary said . Meanwhile , Brian 's surfing career began to blossom . As an amateur , he was named to the National Scholastic Surfing Assn . team twice . He helped San Clemente High School to the state surfing championship as a senior and Saddleback College to the state college title after becoming the individual California college champion . But his pro career has n't developed as smoothly . His best finish was fourth at the Pipeline Masters on Hawaii 's North Shore in 1986 , his first year on the world tour . `` My first year I was trying too hard to be perfect and my performance suffered , '' he said . `` The second year I went for a more radical approach and I made a lot of little mistakes . Last year I tore ligaments in my ( right ) ankle , which slowed me down . This year I 'm trying to take a little bit of each approach from the past and see how it works . '' Brian 's finish at the Op Pro Championships could drastically affect his world ranking . The competition has been billed as the `` Super Bowl of Surfing '' and has drawn competitors such as two-time world-champions Tom Curren and Tom Carroll and defending world-champion Barton Lynch . `` I have n't broken into the top 30 yet , '' Brian said . `` So you could still say I 'm an underdog . It 's been hard on me from a ratings standpoint . This year 's really important to me . '' Brian can find competition in his family , as well . Opinions differ on who 's the best surfing McNulty . Pat says Brian . Brian says it could be Joe or Terence , given time . `` We 're competitive with each other , '' Brian said of his younger brothers . `` But it makes me happy to see them surfing so good . They have a great future . '' Terence , whose best finish is seventh on the pro tour this year , has trouble deciding who 's best . `` It 's hard to say , '' Terence said . `` Sean is out of his prime now . He was definitely a good competitor . Brian can handle some big waves , and Joe is coming into his own . Joe 's powerful on the medium waves . Brian is definitely more developed than Joe and I are . `` We always joke around and say Pat 's the businessman of the family who does n't surf . But he 's into what we 're doing . '' Brian said the brothers ' personalities show in their surfing . `` Sean is really good at the large waves , '' Brian said . `` He was one of the best out there in Hawaii . He had a real powerful style that worked well . Joe surfs a lot like Sean , he has strong legs and works on the big waves . '' Pat , Brian says , has a more laid-back style . `` Pat does n't rip or tear through a wave , '' Brian said . `` He 's not really flashy , but he 's smoother . '' The question of who 's the best surfer likely will rise at McNulty family reunions in years to come . And just what will one find at a McNulty reunion in , say , 30 years ? `` Probably a lot of grandchildren , '' Terence said . `` There definitely would be a lot of kids running around . '' Will the brothers still be surfing ? `` You bet , '' Terence said . `` It 's more of a lifetime sport than something like football . ''
