US producer prices for finished goods rose 0.1 per cent last month and by 1.7 per cent in the year to July , indicating that inflationary pressures remain subdued , the Labour Department reported yesterday . The figures were in line with forecasts in financial markets and followed a 0.2 per cent increase in producer prices in June . Excluding prices of food and energy , which tend to be volatile , the 'core' producer price index rose 0.2 per cent last month and by 2.5 per cent in the past year . It has held steady at this level for several months . The moderation of wholesale price inflation was interpreted in financial markets as further evidence of an unusually lacklustre economic recovery . Most analysts expect it to feed through into lower consumer price inflation , which is running at an underlying rate of about 3.5 per cent .
