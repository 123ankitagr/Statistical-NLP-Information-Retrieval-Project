Environmentalists Call for Ban on Some Gifts : In the Christmas season 's first boycott of merchandise disliked by conservationists , San Francisco-based Rain Forest Action Network has asked holiday shoppers to avoid buying products made from imported tropical rain forest wood . The group listed the most common imports as teak , mahogany and rosewood . Teak is used in kitchen utensils and salad bowls . Teak , mahogany and rosewood veneers are used on home and office furniture . Some pencils , picture frames and tool handles are also likely to be made from rain forest wood , said the group . Some products were exempted , however . Two furniture makers , Smith & Hawken and Herman Miller , replant as much teak and mahogany as they harvest . Faber-Castell Corp. escapes the ban by using U.S.-grown cedar for its pencils .
