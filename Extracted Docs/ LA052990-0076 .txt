Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will not make a previously announced visit to the Hoover Institution during his trip to Stanford University next week . Soviet officials decided that Gorbachev 's schedule during his June 3 and 4 visit to the Bay Area `` was just too tight , '' Bob Freelen , Stanford vice president for public affairs , said Monday . During the Stanford visit , Gorbachev will meet with University President Donald Kennedy ; former Secretary of State George P. Shultz , now a professor of international economics at Stanford 's Graduate School of Business , and with students and other faculty members at the school of business . The Hoover Institution on War , Revolution and Peace , a longtime bastion of anti-communism , has one of the world 's largest collection of material on the 1917 Russian Revolution , including `` mug shots '' of known revolutionaries that came from the secret police files of the czarist days .
