william fairbank whose work lowtemperature superconductivity laid foundation hundreds scientific experiments worldwide died he 72 fairbank professor emeritus physics stanford university suffered heart attack saturday jogging near palo alto campus university officials said fairbank researched nature superconductivity participated search gravity waves subatomic particles called quarks monopoles believed component magnetism his work basis multimilliondollar project test final unproven prediction albert einsteins general theory relativity fairbank worked lab night death believed called antimurphy law physics this held one understands experimental situation correctly three four things come together make impossible possible he performed first superconductivity experiment 1947 brother henry also physicist laser advancement fairbanks work centered ability materials offer resistance electrical current cooled near absolute zero stanford said fairbanks influence physics included development stanford superconducting accelerator linear accelerator cooled 2 degrees absolute zero the superconductivity allows greater degrees sensitivity led first demonstration free electron laser his research often led areas in 1975 developed machine experimental program killed cancer cells without damage organs tissue designed use cancers mouth throat certain brain lung tumors medical pion generator used stream pions subatomic particles generated highenergy accelerator kill cells minute nuclear explosions fairbank born minneapolis graduated whitman college washington earned phd yale university 1948 before joining stanford 1959 taught university washington amherst college duke university worked staff radiation laboratory massachusetts institute technology
