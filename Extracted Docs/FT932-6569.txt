argentinas film directors enjoy prestige influence and an international reputation to which few of their latin colleagues can aspire directors such as ms maria luisa bemberg are internationally respected mr luis puenzo won an oscar in 1986 for the official story mr fernando solanas won a cannes prize in 1988 as best director directors have become the keepers of argentinas conscience far too many argentines would prefer to forget about the people who disappeared during the 197683 military regime or ignore the poverty and despair that economic change is bringing the industry seems to be going through a renaissance but the truth is that argentine cinema is perhaps facing the greatest crisis in its history like everywhere else in the world people are making fewer visits to the cinema and watching videos or cable tv more the problem is that this trend has been more prominent in argentina than in most other countries twenty years ago argentina had more than 3000 cinemas today it has about 260 in contrast there are about 1400 cable tv companies and video clubs proliferate on every street corner less than ten years ago a successful locallymade film could sell over more than 2m tickets today a successful film sells 400000 tickets few films sell more than 100000 tickets mr fernando solanas the angry old man of argentine cinema worries that people who are not able to create their own images are too weak to defend their own cultural identity we are condemned to consuming images from abroad but there is no reciprocity they do not accept out images still argentines remain great cinephiles but instead of going to the cinema they are watching films at home the trouble is government film subsidies are tied to the number of cinema tickets a film sells the fewer tickets sold the less government money it gets and government support is vital to making films almost everywhere outside hollywood mr luis puenzo who made theofficial story and old gringo gloomily predicts that argentina will not make much more than half a dozen movies this year in the postwar years it turned out a film a week films these days need international support mr luis cesar dangiolillo whose matar el abuelito was coproduced with spanish tv says its difficult to make films in argentina for us its a very expensive activity although for the rest of the world our costs are very low as well as money these coproductions attract big names which help independent productions compete with hollywood films alsointernational backing gives directors a chance to broaden their range puenzo made a dollars 15m film version of albert camus the plague in buenos aires starring william hurt with 80 per cent of the dollars 15m budget covered by french producers maria luisa bembergs new film de eso no se habla we dont talk about this stars marcello mastroianni in an argentineitalian coproduction argentine films tend to be bleak if not apocalyptic with an occasional tendency to becoming ponderous and prolix tristan bauers despues de la tormenta a film about despair decay and poverty is as powerful as it is depressing luis puenzo says he chose to set the plague in contemporary latin america because the plague is in the last instance evil this relates indirectly to what happened to us with the military the plague is an ambiguous hidden illdefined evil the central theme of the book and the film is that the plague always returns the bacillus never dies mr solanas dispensed with subtlety in his latest film el viaje the journey a longwinded satire on modern latin america it tells the story of a young mans search for his missing father on his travels he encounters buenos aires awash with greed and corruption with the deft use of special effects the city is shown flooded with sewage mr solanas makes harsh criticisms of mr menem who predictably is suing him for slander solanas career gives an idea of the skills argentine directors need to survive in the 25 years since la hora de los hornos his first feature film mr solanas was exiled for eight years and has made only five other films he says a film maker is an organiser who has to do everything el viaje was filmed in five countries and took five years to make i may not make another film for two years still argentinas film industry is unlikely to die mr puenzo says 2500 people are studying film making plus countless thousands more studying drama and successful argentine directors invariably come home mr puenzo says he wants his next project to be a low budget film made in argentina spoken in spanish with argentine actors and dealing with argentine themes
