Stanford got off to a fast start by winning three of five events Friday at the Pacific 10 Conference women 's swimming championships at East Los Angeles College . The Cardinal leads California , 519 to 376 . UCLA is third at 340 , Arizona State fourth at 304 and USC is fifth at 236 . Earlier , Stanford senior Katie Connors won the one-meter springboard diving event at the McDonald 's Swim Stadium at USC . Connor edged UCLA freshman Kristen Walls , 410.85 to 409.65 . Because the East L. A. pool has no diving facilities , those events are being held at USC . The three-meter springboard finals are today at 1:30 p.m. and the 10-meter platform is Sunday at 10 a.m. Stanford took up where Connors left off . After Cal won the 200-yard freestyle relay , the Cardinal depth took over . Janet Evans led four Stanford swimmers in the championship final of the 500-yard freestyle with a time of 4:43.74 . In the next event , the 200-yard individual medley , Stanford swimmers placed first , third , fifth , sixth and seventh , led by freshman Janel Jorgensen in 2:02.81 . Teri O'Laughlin of USC was second in 2:03.67 . Kris Stoudt of UCLA won the 50-yard freestyle with an NCAA qualifying time of 23.36 to give the Bruins their only victory . The Pac-10 men 's diving championship started as UCLA sophomore Chris Dudka won the three-meter springboard . He defeated USC 's Brian Earley , 551.40 to 527.05 .
