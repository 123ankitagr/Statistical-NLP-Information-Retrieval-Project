More than 25 media correspondents crammed into a Valentine 's Day news conference at Breckenridge to mark the expedition 's first 50 days , plus Arnie Wilson 's 50th birthday . Wilson , who is suffering frostbite on his nose , reports : 'We were forced to ski after dark at Keystone to keep up our record of skiing every day in 1994 . 'To clock up more miles , we spent Tuesday skiing madly , and with the help of night skiing , we managed more than 30,000 vertical feet in a day - more than the height of Everest . ' You could win a skiing holiday for two or runner-up prizes of malt whisky by entering the competition which appeared in Weekend FT on February 5 ( copies available from the FT shop , tel : 071-873 3324 ) .
