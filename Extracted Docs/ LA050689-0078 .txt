i would like to ask the protesters against using animals for medical research two questions 1 do they think it is more humane to use human beings for that purpose 2 how many of the protesters are vegetarians i do not think there are many do they know that meat eaters are killing animals by the thousands every day therefore such protests are not only ridiculous but also hypocritical jay chen south pasadena
