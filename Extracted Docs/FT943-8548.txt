Poland 's central bank has criticised the government 's inflation target for next year as unrealistic . Mr Witold Kozinski , deputy president , told Nowa Europa newspaper that the 16 per cent target was unrealistic after this year 's 27-28 per cent rate . The government 's outline budget , he said , seemed to indicate a sharp rise in central bank financing of the deficit . Unless that share was reduced , the inflation rate would not be brought down . Mr Kozinski called for more information on what the government 's financing requirements might be so that the bank could help .
