willy brandt the former west german chancellor who died on thursday aged 78, belonged to that select band of post-war european leaders who stamped an indelible mark not just on their countries but across the european continent his chancellorship from 1969 to 1974, was relatively short but his period of uninterrupted influence on the centre stage of international politics was longer than that of any other contemporary politician in germany or abroad in an almost kaleidoscopic variety of roles ranging from charismatic young mayor of berlin to his latter years as elder statesman brandt gave shape and direction to german politics during four post-war decades in his last years before he was stricken by cancer in the spring brandt took up a new part as an emotional force behind german unification the turbulence of his long life mirrored germany's own vicissitudes brandt was a man of varied hues and changing moods his capacity for misjudgment could sometimes be almost as striking as his qualities as an activist and visionary yet beyond all the restlessness which drove him on and the controversy which dogged him brandt stood out as germany's paramount statesman of peace after the horror and the shame of the second world war he was the first chancellor to allow foreigners and his own compatriots to believe again in a decent germany playing its part in the international community brandt's career moulded beneath the shadows of the third reich and maturing during the cold war was dedicated to ensuring that his country would never again be a source of instability and evil through his ostpolitik in the early 1970 s normalising west germany's relations with its neighbours in the east brandt did more than any other politician before mikhail gorbachev to bridge the post-1945 division of the continent his policies on eastern europe were hotly contested at the time by the german right as a sell-out to communism but brandt was a prime architect of the detente which eventually in 1990, made german unification possible in the 1970 s and 1980 s he occupied himself increasingly with international affairs as chairman of the international socialists and of the brandt commission it was a source of frustration that the commission despite all its good intentions failed to make any headway in closing the north-south economic gap the sweeping aside of communism in east germany in the autumn and winter of 1989 gave brandt a pivotal new domestic role in a nation being reforged before the eyes of an astonished world at an age when many lesser men would have settled into their armchairs brandt was out on the stump in both parts of germany still fighting elections for his social democratic party spd still drawing the crowds with his peculiar brand of rasping oratory and his message that the fatherland was now growing together again brandt's political pinnacle came much earlier during his five years as chancellor a period marking the return of the spd as the main party in government for the first time since the weimar republic of 1919-33 his chancellorship ended abruptly with his resignation over a spy affair still one of germany's most opaque post-war political crises he remained spd chairman until 1987, and was the party's honorary chairman until his death brandt showed a singular ability both to stir his power to attract younger women had a legendary if not notorious quality and to disappoint his setbacks were almost as striking as his triumphs and for all his undoubted thoughtfulness he could teeter alarmingly between hesitancy and rashness in many ways he was the hamlet of german politics partly because he was so often going against the tide of contemporary ideas brandt was an uncomfortable often enigmatic figure respected rather than loved by the social democratic party he was not the first german leader to owe part of his authority to his aloofness manoeuvring his way through pitfalls along his political path brandt was all too often reminded that he remained ultimately an outsider the central component of brandt's ostpolitik was recognition of east germany as a separate state although he clung to the nebulous goal of unity of the nation a term he distinguished from reunification which he rejected because of its revanchiste overtones he cajoled his countrymen to come to terms with the legacy of hitler by accepting the status quo of division brandt laid an important part of the groundwork for eventually ending it when the german black red and gold flag was hoisted in berlin in the midnight unity day ceremony on october 3 1990, the 76-year-old brandt was there with the other dignatories on the balcony of the reichstag staring out at the huge crowds with the inscrutability which with age he came to wear like a mask in accepting the nobel peace prize awarded in 1971 for his ostpolitik breakthrough he said i believe in diversity and hence in doubt so it was an entirely typical paradox that unity took place after brandt had given up any idea of seeing it happen who would want to believe that one day the german democratic republic would be annexed to the federal republic and that would be that he wrote in his memoirs published in 1989 the elliptical question was a favourite form of statement for a man who could not take refuge in certainties his scepticism like his self-doubt had its origin in the complexities of his childhood he was born as herbert ernst frahm on december 18 1913 in the northern city of lubeck the illegitimate son of a 19-year-old shopgirl he never knew his father a loss which helped shape his non-conformism and concern for the under-privileged as well as a sporadic lack of discipline he grew up under the guardianship of his grandfather a man who in a further twist turned out not to have been the father of his mother he joined the spd at the age of 16 disenchanted with the weimar republic and supporting a more active struggle against the far right he quit a year later in 1931, to join a splinter group the socialist workers party this early defiance provides a key to his later tolerance as party chairman of the radicalism of the young socialists during the 1970 s and his attempted espousal of the cause of the greens ecology party during the 1980 s of the younger generation he once said they feel that the old and middle-aged may already have made so many compromises that they can no longer confront the new tasks of today shortly after hitler took power in 1933, brandt's splinter group aware that he was in danger of arrest by the nazis decided to send him to oslo he was smuggled out of germany on a fishing smack taking with him the name of willy brandt which he had already been using as a pen-name it was the start of 12 years of exile during his three attempts to run for the chancellorship during the 1960 s brandt's political enemies tried to use this emigration to show that he was less than totally committed to his country indeed brandt's views on germany often seemed strangely detached he once said that chancellor helmut kohl with whom he forged in his later years a close political relationship though never real friendship would be a better leader if he knew a little more about the world outside brandt became a socialist activist in scandinavia returning briefly to berlin on an undercover mission as a journalist on the republican side in 1937, he witnessed the horrors of the spanish civil war in 1940 he was arrested by the invading german forces in norway while wearing a norwegian uniform interned and then released he fled to neutral sweden where he continued his underground work took norwegian citizenship and met his future wife rut who was norwegian-born his marriage to his first wife carlota whom he met in 1940, broke down in 1944 after his marriage to rut also ended in divorce brandt wed in 1983 the journalist and author brigitte seebacher brandt returned to his defeated homeland in 1945, as a correspondent covering the nuremberg trials he found his way back to the spd but remained a norwegian citizen until 1948 in 1947 he became press attache at the norwegian military mission in berlin shortly afterwards he met edzard reuter the spd governing mayor of west berlin during the 1948-49 blockade who heavily influenced brandt's firm anti-communist policies in berlin during the 1950 s and 1960 s in 1949 brandt was elected to the bundestag as a west berlin deputy and in 1955 he became president of the west berlin senate in november 1956 he twice showed his oratorical skills by stopping crowds of berliners angered by soviet crushing of the hungarian revolution from rushing into east berlin towards bloody confrontation with russian tanks in 1957 brandt was elected governing mayor of west berlin this was a crucial period the spd under the guidance of the party's irascible strategist herbert wehner was moving to cast off the encumbrances of marxist ideology and reform itself into a modern volkspartei people's party brandt's experience in 1961, when he witnessed the western allies helplessness as the berlin wall was built had a profound effect on his future foreign policy the implication was clear however important bonn's links with the us washington was incapable of giving west germany full protection against the soviet union through building up relations with the east bonn would eventually have to take greater initiative for securing its own security after three years as foreign minister in the grand coalition with the christian democrats of 1966-69 brandt had the chance to put his precepts into effect when he became chancellor in 1970, in coalition with the free democrats his finest hour came when the coalition was returned with an increased majority in the 1972 elections making the spd the largest single party in the bundestag by 1972, the high points of his crusading european policies the emotional visit to erfurt in east germany in 1970, and his dramatic gesture later that year when he knelt at the warsaw monument to the jewish ghetto were past the victory bloom soon wilted as he ran into obstacles with france over policies towards western europe he became bogged down by domestic difficulties particularly an outbreak of public-sector strikes in april 1974, gunter guillaume an official in the chancellery who had been sufficiently close to brandt to have accompanied him on holiday to norway was arrested on charges of spying for east germany under pressure from wehner still the main spd power-broker and disheartened by the reluctance of others notably hans-dietrich genscher then interior minister to shoulder any of the blame for the resulting debacle brandt impulsively accepted complete responsibility he resigned from office by staying on as spd chairman brandt hoped to foster party unity in fact the relationship gradually worsened with the other members of the spd leadership the increasingly neurotic wehner and helmut schmidt as schmidt became a target of spd left-wingers opposing his course on defence nuclear energy and the economy the chancellor accused brandt of countering party discipline by encouraging the cause of younger radicals after the spd went into opposition in 1982, and lost two general elections in 1983 and 1987, it became clear that brandt himself had contributed to the party's sense of drift in march 1987 a somewhat mindless row brought his downfall as party chairman his attempt to hire as spd press officer an able political scientist a young woman greek-born above all a non-party member proved too daring for some party stalwarts badly piqued the patriarch who would have bowed out anyway in 1988 announced that he was stepping down in a emotional two-hour farewell address at bonn's beethoven hall in june 1987, brandt declared that his brand of libertarian social democracy was one where the leader would make mistakes i have not always considered what should be considered i am sorry and that is it conditioned by the threat germany had once posed to its neighbours and to itself brandt spent his life looking several ways at once his greatest service was to show that a certain ambiguity could buttress germany's position in the world rather than undermine it his greatest regret may have been to have died before he or anyone else could be completely sure that the unification of the german nation would turn out an unmitigated success
