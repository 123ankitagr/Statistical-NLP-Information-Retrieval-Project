The Bella Lewitzky Dance Company today rejected a $ 72,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts in protest over anti-obscenity provisions in the NEA 's 1990 grant guidelines . The Los Angeles-based dance company , which has received NEA funding since 1972 , also said it and People for the American Way will file a federal lawsuit challenging Congress ' content restrictions on grants as unconstitutional . `` We hope to file the suit in either Los Angeles or Washington , D.C. , within the next two weeks , '' said Michael Hudson , vice president of People for the American Way . The suit will charge that grant conditions imposed on the dance company and all NEA recipients are an unconstitutional limitation on free expression as guaranteed by the First Amendment , Hudson said . The refusal of the $ 72,000 comes several weeks after New York City theater producer Joseph Papp turned down $ 50,000 in NEA funding in a similar protest .
