A public meeting on wildlife preservation on the Palos Verdes Peninsula will be held at 7:30 p.m. Monday at the South Coast Botanic Gardens . Results of a Rolling Hills survey on residents ' knowledge of and attitudes about wildlife preservation will be announced at the meeting at 26300 Crenshaw Blvd . The mail survey , which had a 40 % response , was conducted by a Wildlife Preservation Committee appointed by the Rolling Hills City Council after some residents said increasing urbanization is driving away skunks , raccoons , foxes , opossums and other creatures . Don Gales , a naturalist and vice chairman of the committee , said that the meeting will also discuss ways to attract more animal and bird life and that committee plans to release pheasant and quail into the gated community .
