Environment secretary John Gummer yesterday opened the five-mile extension to the Docklands Light Railway to Beckton in east London after a delay of 18 months . The Pounds 280m project to extend the railway has been dogged by problems with construction and systems installation . The extension , which connects Beckton with the Isle of Dogs and the City , is funded by the London Docklands Development Corporation . Mr Gummer also launched the West Silvertown Urban Village , where he took the controls of a mechanical digger ( above ) .
