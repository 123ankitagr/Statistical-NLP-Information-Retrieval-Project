A Newhall doctor accused of overprescribing painkillers to patients who said they subsequently became addicted pleaded innocent Wednesday to 10 felony counts of furnishing controlled substances . Dr. Sandra Soho , 47 , allegedly made out prescriptions for codeine-fortified painkillers without giving patients thorough examinations to determine if the drugs were necessary . One patient told Los Angeles County sheriff 's investigators that she received prescriptions for 4,300 painkillers in a year , while others said they received from 1,650 to 3,600 tablets over periods ranging from 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 months . Soho , who was Dr. Stanley Soho until a 1986 sex-change operation , entered the pleas during an arraignment in Newhall Municipal Court . The physician refused to answer reporters ' questions following the brief hearing . Her attorney , Thomas F. Kascoutas , also declined to comment , saying that he did not want to reveal his defense strategy to prosecutors . A preliminary hearing was scheduled for July 30 in Newhall Municipal Court . Soho , who lives in Hollywood , was arrested April 17 after two patients complained to sheriff 's narcotics investigators that they had become addicted to drugs she had prescribed . One of the patients said she went to the doctor seeking relief from headaches and back pain but was given a prescription for 100 codeine painkillers after a rudimentary examination . She soon began taking the pills `` to help her get through the day , '' according to a sheriff 's report filed with court papers . Soho was barred from practicing medicine from 1981 to 1984 after state medical examiners found her conduct incompetent and corrupt . She later purchased the practice of Dr. Milos Klvana , a home birthing advocate , who was sentenced in February to 53 years to life on charges that he had killed eight infants and a fetus .
