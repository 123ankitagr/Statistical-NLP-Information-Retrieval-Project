resentment over attacks by european environmentalists on sarawaks timber industry bubbled over in an address by the chief minister datuk patinggi tan sri haji abdul taib mahmud in kuching this week to an audience of scientists attending a workshop on ecology conservation and management of south east asian rainforests he asked how much accusations tallied with facts and suggested that the green lobby was political rather than scientific and at the extreme could being seen as a form of protectionism restricting international trade in tropical wood products his views are not surprising from a minister of the malaysian state of sarawak which is 70 per cent forest covered and depends very heavily on its timber trade for revenue and some of the frustration stems from a lack of international recognition of the efforts being made to improve forest management and control about 54 per cent of sarawaks forest is classified as permanent forest estate pfe for timber production in 1990 an international team of forest and environment experts put together by the international tropical timber organisation was invited to review the forest situation in sarawak one of its recommendations was a reduction in annual log production from the pfe in order to be surer of future sustainable harvests as a result sarawak set out to reduce production from the pfe from 122m cubic metres to 92m cu m in two bites each of 15m cu m in 1992 and 1993 it has not been easy to contemplate a 25 per cent drop and the state government has had to impose quotas on logging companies during the last four months of this year to ensure the target is reached some timber companies have had to reduce production by more than 50 per cent forest areas outside the pfe are not subject to such controls
