Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : 'Resurrected ' Great Britain , 1988 , 96 minutes 6:45 p.m . The only thing more hellish than war is its uncivilized aftermath in this grim first film from director Paul Greengrass ( co-author of the controversial book `` Spycatcher '' ) , which begins seven weeks after the end of the brief Falklands War . A missing and presumably dead British soldier miraculously straggles in from the hills , and although this shy young man is at first given a hero 's welcome back home , he is eventually presumed to be a cowardly deserter and is ostracized by everyone he knows . Well-told , but unremittingly bleak.CHRIS WILLMAN
