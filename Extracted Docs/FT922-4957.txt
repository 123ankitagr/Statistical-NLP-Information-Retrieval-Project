it used to be said that french carmakers would be knocked spinning by japanese competition once europe lifted its curbs on car imports at the end of the decade now is the time to send that view to the crusher over the past decade peugeot and renault the countrys two main car groups have retreated from the brink of bankruptcy and top executives at both believe they can catch up and fight on equal terms with japan last year the peugeot group which also includes citroen was the worlds most profitable carmaker in terms of net sales margins renault staged a startling recovery with more than doubled net profits and outsold all foreign competition in the fast growing german market can these be the same companies that were one of europes biggest industrial headaches 10 years ago not quite since then they have made big increases in quality productivity and efficiency european volume producers took more than twice as long per man as their japanese counterparts to make a car in 1989 according to a seminal study by the massachusetts institute of technology mit today french carmakers productivity is a mere 10 per cent behind that of japanese car producers in britain itself 10 per cent behind the japanese in japan says another study by consultants mckinsey just how peugeot and renault came so far is instructive to other european manufacturing industries aiming to match japanese productivity standards like carmakers across the world the french have made deep cuts in their workforces down by 25 per cent over the past five years at renault and 5 per cent at the leaner peugeot they still have a long way to go according to a recent study by the french planning commission which estimates that the french car industry must trim its labour force by another 25 per cent a year for the rest of the decade to be competitive job cuts are only part of the story peugeot and renault have have also made profound changes in the way people and stocks are organised overturning old hierarchies and introducing japanesestyle project and production management teams peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per cent in five years while renault says it has improved its productivity by 6 per cent per year over the same period both aim to repeat that improvement by the end of the decade this is partly the result of heavy investment in automated production lines in the mid1980s the investment has not been an unqualified success however recently they have reintroduced more labour and simpler machines to the shopfloor because the new robots broke down too often this is revealing for as the mit study pointed out organisation is more important than automation in even the most modern japanese plants again renault and peugeot applied a lesson from japan by breaking down the old production line into small autonomous units each responsible for product quality and machine maintenance this has already enabled peugeot to close the refinishing departments which used to occupy 10 to 20 per cent of total production time now each team does its own refinishing on the production line and is taught to treat the next team down the line as a customer says jeanyves helmer director of the peugeot groups car division french carmakers see themselves today like their japanese competitors as primarily designers and assemblers they have mostly stopped being highly integrated although they still make what they consider to be strategic components like automatic gearboxes where peugeot and renault are considering collaborating boughtin components have risen to just over 60 per cent of costs at peugeot and 67 per cent at renault a steep rise over recent years renault has set up a make or buy committee which treats inhouse suppliers on the same footing as external components makers says philippe gras deputy chief executive like the japanese the french have started to work more closely with component suppliers to the extent of consulting on new designs peugeot and renault have for the past five years been running joint audits to keep component suppliers quality up to the mark grading them japanese style again according to their ability to do their own quality control they are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers productivity too suppliers are also expected to deliver more frequently to match the justintime stock control which is now commonplace in both groups factories peugeot for example has reduced its stocks of unfinished goods from 12 days supply in 1984 to four days last year but this technique is also a risk for french carmakers because they can not guarantee japanesestyle labour stability renault discovered this to its cost last year when a strike at its engine and gearbox plant took 10 days to bring its entire french and belgian car production to a halt design management is another important element in productivity where the french are quickly applying lessons from the far east japan still designs and launches new cars much faster and more cheaply than france for around ffr34bn pounds 300mpounds 400m in three years as against the french average of ffr68bn in four to five years renault and peugeot have taken similar approaches to the problem formerly new cars were designed in a cumbersome way with the blueprint passing from the design department through engineering and production management both companies have in the past three years started setting up project teams which bring together all departments involved in a new car launch to work simultaneously design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results for new models from 1994 both agree that despite the progress one big problem remains french carworkers are older and less educated than their japanese counterparts gigantic efforts are needed to correct this handicap says the planning commission report which calls for heavy public spending on retraining we have from now until the year 2000 to get up to the right level all of us in the company know we can do it says gras the machine
