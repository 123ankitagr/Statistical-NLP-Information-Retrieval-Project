The Pope will go ahead with plans to visit Sarajevo on September 8 even though Bosnian Serb leaders warned that his security could not be guaranteed , writes Laura Silber in Belgrade . The visit is intended to show solidarity with the inhabitants of the Bosnian city , whose population of 525,000 was about 7 per cent Catholic before the outbreak of war . Mr Radovan Karadzic , Bosnian Serb leader , said the papal visit would not get consent because of security concerns . 'The Moslems can shoot him down and accuse the Serbs . That would be terrible for the Catholic world . That would be disastrous . ' The Vatican has already abandoned plans to visit Belgrade , the Serbian capital , after the Serbian Orthodox Church refused to receive the pontiff . The Pope will visit Zagreb , the capital of Croatia , on September 10 .
