New York will build the nation 's first prison exclusively for drug addicts and alcoholics as part of an $ 886.6-million plan to put 7,100 more inmates behind bars , Gov . Mario M. Cuomo and legislative leaders said . The deal calls for construction of six new medium-security prisons scattered across Upstate New York . It will also create seven `` annexes '' built onto existing prisons that would provide drug treatment and counseling for inmates within two years of parole eligibility . The new drug prison , to be built at a cost of $ 65 million near the U.S. Army Depot in Romulus , Seneca County , will offer comprehensive treatment .
