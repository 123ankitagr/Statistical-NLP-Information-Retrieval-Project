A group of Orange Coast College students who took part in the school 's first `` semester abroad '' program have learned there 's a world of difference between Costa Mesa and Costa Rica . But it was these contrasts -- particularly the environment and language -- that led to the creation of the program in Central America . Botany and ecology professor John Lenanton and Spanish professor Susana Salessi put together the 15-week study program after a 1988 visit to the college by Carlos Rivera , a Costa Rican government official . The teachers were attracted by Costa Rica 's stable politics and educational opportunities . `` There is not another place that can compete with Costa Rica with regard to diversity of habitat , '' Lenanton said . Students were attracted by the opportunity to live in another country . `` I was always interested in the environment and I wanted to learn a language in a neutral country that has good relations with the United States , '' student Julie Rona said . The Orange Coast College group arrived in Costa Rica in January . Classes have been held at the Institututo Centroamericano de Asuntos Internacionales -- the Central American Institute for International Affairs -- in San Jose . The institute provided classrooms and a political science instructor , organized field trips and coordinated housing for students with Costa Rican families . The course has taken students to Costa Rica 's two coastlines , to the volcanic mountain range that separates them and into three distinct tropical forest environments . There have also been trips to museums , Latin dance clubs , the Legislature and the theater . SUZI BRAKKEN
