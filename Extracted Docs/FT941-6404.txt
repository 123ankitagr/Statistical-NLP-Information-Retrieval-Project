The success of films such as Jurassic Park helped to encourage large increases in cinema attendances last year , according to research for the 11th annual survey of the industry . The research for the Cinema Advertising Association found that 69 per cent of those aged over seven said that they visited the cinema , the highest proportion in recent history and an increase of 4m on the previous year . The number of people visiting the cinema regularly , defined as once a month or more , increased from 11 per cent of the population to 14 per cent . This accounted for a total of 7.139m visits last year , a rise of 28 per cent compared with 1992 . According to the survey , carried out by BMRB International , the four most popular films were Jurassic Park with 14.2m viewers ; The Bodyguard , 7.2m ; Home Alone 2 , 6.1m ; and Sister Act , 5.4m . Jurassic Park set a modern record with an audience 3m higher than the film ET in 1983 . The survey shows that 24 films were seen by more than 2m people , compared with 21 in 1992 and 14 in 1990 . More than 40 per cent of cinema visits in the two months prior to the research , carried out in October and November , were to the 66 multiplex cinemas in the UK - all of which opened in the past nine years . The survey also suggests that 85 per cent of those aged over seven have a video recorder in the home and that , on a monthly basis , 70 per cent watched programmes recorded from television and 16 per cent from satellite . Some 39 per cent watched hired videos .
