a writer of my acquaintance neil lyndon is a man with a peculiar mission he wants to know how many people there are in the world or more particularly how we know how many people there are in the world or still more particularly how those who say they know how many people there are in the world can justify their claim so he rang up the office of population and censuses at the united nations and asked an information officer there if he was right in thinking that the population of the earth now exceeded 6bn er that cant be right said the population counter its more like 5 12 bn isnt it china one imagines is the source of much of the confusion my friend asked the man at the un how they knew the population of china for example when was the last census held in china and how was it carried out oh dear said the man from the un i very much doubt you could find anyone who could answer that question so my friend rang up the chinese embassy in london no one answered they must have been one short it is one must concede to lyndon a big and perhaps even an important question since we tend to be given so many statistics expressed as a percentage of the population of the world what percentage have aids for example it is a little unsettling to discover that they are all based on ignorance unsettling perhaps but not surprising stock markets for example seem based entirely on the principle of general ignorance about everything of importance if the true facts about corporate performance were universally available and understood there would be very little difference of opinion and hence very little room for trading this sort of ignorance is acceptable because it is somehow abstract and intangible but general ignorance is expanding to cover the most practical and down to earth problems take for example something as seemingly simple as the workings of the internal combustion engine it used to be the case that almost anyone who drove a car would have a basic idea of how the engine worked they could imagine armed with the necessary diagram how the thing might be put right if it stuttered stalled or conked out few owners of a modern car would have any idea what to do in a similar situation indeed the electronics have become so complex and computerised that i much doubt if the average garage owner has a clear idea of how to solve a breakdown in a modern engine many parts have to be sent back to the manufacturers the only people who understand the sophisticated electronic management systems i suppose the retort of the car manufacturers would be that their customers have ceased to have the same need to know how engines work because the things are now so much more reliable than they were but still as one drives one of these gently humming beauties it is difficult not to feel uneasy that one is somehow a cog in a machine beyond ones comprehension this is a particular example of a universal problem increasingly one is told to trust the expert the very word expert has become something of a commonplace in newspaper accounts of otherwise inexplicable events the readers being reassured that such and such an expert or in the tabloid press boffin has come up with such and such a theory which explains everything the experts sometimes work under other names such as doctor or garage mechanic or psephoplogist or environmental health officer it would be pleasant always to believe that these experts are trading in more than the blend of half understood facts ignorance and prejudice which inform the beliefs of the rest of us but that would amount to an act of faith just as big as that required to believe that the average garage mechanic can mend our car engine to believe that the united nations office of populations and censuses really knows how many people there are in the world and that there will always be someone to answer the telephone in the chinese embassy dominic lawson is editor of the spectator
