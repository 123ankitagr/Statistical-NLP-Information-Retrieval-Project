A Van Nuys Municipal Court judge quoted lyrics from a Michael Jackson song as he sentenced a woman Monday to 2 1/2 years in jail for repeatedly harassing the singer and claiming to be his wife `` Billie Jean . '' Lavon A. Muhammad , 41 , was found guilty last week of eight misdemeanor charges stemming from her violation of a 1986 court order that she not pose as the singer 's wife or visit his Encino home . As he imposed the maximum allowable sentence , Judge Stephen E. O'Neil urged that Muhammad -- who insisted that court officials call her Billie Jean Jackson -- listen to a song on Michael Jackson 's latest album , `` Bad . '' The song is entitled `` Leave Me Alone . '' Muhammad has never met Jackson but claims that the singer fathered her three children , Deputy City Atty . David S. Kestenbaum said . The prosecutor said she tried to buy a wedding gown and bill it to Jackson and had a bill for $ 145 in medical treatment sent to Jackson 's house . She walked up Jackson 's driveway and was arrested by Los Angeles police early this month .
