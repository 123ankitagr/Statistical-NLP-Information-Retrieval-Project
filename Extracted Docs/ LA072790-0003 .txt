i suppose that i should not find it surprising that reagan whose administration was involved in everything from illegal arms deals to supporting terrorists is praising nixons record while the activities of the nixon administration may seem somewhat tame by comparison that makes them no less repugnant perhaps we are as a nation forgetting what responsible leadership means to such an extent that someday the appalling actions of nixon will seem commonplace and historians will indeed praise his achievements however if there is any justice or indeed morality in the world it will be the moral failing of the reagan administration that will be recognized not the dubious successes of the nixon administration jonathan kaplan irvine
