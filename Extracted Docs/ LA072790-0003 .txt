I suppose that I should not find it surprising that Reagan , whose Administration was involved in everything from illegal arms deals to supporting terrorists , is praising Nixon 's record . While the activities of the Nixon Administration may seem somewhat tame by comparison , that makes them no less repugnant . Perhaps we are as a nation forgetting what responsible leadership means to such an extent that someday the appalling actions of Nixon will seem commonplace , and historians will indeed praise his achievements . However , if there is any justice ( or indeed morality ) in the world , it will be the moral failing of the Reagan Administration that will be recognized , not the dubious successes of the Nixon Administration .
