Zang Toi never gave a thought to Americanizing his name , which now appears on the label of one of the hottest new collections in the country . It may read oddly ( the last name is pronounced `` toy '' ) , but that has n't hurt him one bit . New York-based and Malaysia-born , Toi is entering his second year in business after a five-year stint assisting New York designer Mary Jane Marcasiano . You see his quirky Amerasian style in the way he dresses : Shorts made of gold-threaded songket fabric traditionally used for wedding clothes , apple-green custom-made blazer , black velvet Belgian slippers . And you see it in his designs . In his fall collection , available at I. Magnin Beverly Hills , colors are as exotic as rare flora , such as chartreuse green tailored tweeds ( paired with silver fox ) , a lacquer red moire mini-opera coat that reverses to a jewel-colored paisley , and a shocking pink trench coat paired with a bright red waist cincher . Prices range from $ 200 ( shorts ) to $ 1,800 ( evening coat ) . Malaysia , the 29-year-old designer explains , is a multicultural country , composed of native Malay , Indians and Chinese -- his own heritage -- and he finds inspiration everywhere . `` I got my sense of color from the Indians who are known for wearing shocking pink , orange and red together . They treat shocking pink like navy here in America . '' BETTY GOODWIN
