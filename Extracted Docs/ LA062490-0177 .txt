l ron hubbard enjoyed being pampered he surrounded himself with teenage followers whom he indoctrinated treated like servants and cherished as though they were his own children he called them the commodores messengers messenger he would boom in the morning and wed pull him out of bed one recalled the youngsters whose parents belonged to hubbards church of scientology would lay out his clothes run his shower and help him dress he taught them how to sprinkle powder in his socks and gently slip them on so as not to pull the hairs on his legs they made sure the temperature in his room never varied from 72 degrees they boiled water at night to keep the humidity just right they would hand him a cigarette and follow in his footsteps with an ashtray when hubbards bursitis acted up a messenger would wrap his shoulders in a lumberjack shirt that had been warmed on a heater long gone were those days when hubbard was scratching out a living now in the early 1970s he fancied silk pants ascots and nautical caps it was evident that the redhaired author had enjoyed many a good meal it was a high honor for scientologists to serve beside hubbard even if it meant performing such dreary tasks as ironing his clothes or ferrying his messages but for some it was also disconcerting the privileged few who worked at his side saw personality flaws and quirks not reflected in the staged photographs or in hubbards biographies they came to know the man behind the mystique they said he could display the temperament of a spoiled child and the eccentricities of a reclusive howard hughes when upset hubbard was known to erupt like a volcano spewing obscenities and insults former scientologist adelle hartwell once testified during a florida hearing on scientology that she saw hubbard throw fits i actually saw him take his hat off one day and stomp on it and cry like a baby hubbard had been hotheaded since his youth when his red hair earned him the nickname brick one of hubbards classmates recalled a day in 11th grade when the husky hubbard for no apparent reason got into a fight with gus leger the lanky assistant principal at helena high school in helena mont old gus was up at the blackboard recalled andrew richardson he taught geometry he was laying out this problem and brick let loose with a piece of chalk and he missed him leger whirled and threw an eraser at brick who ducked and it hit a girl right behind him in the face hubbard wrestled with the teacher then stuffed him into a trash can said richardson we all got to laughing and he leger couldnt get up richardson said chuckling at the memory richardson said that while the students helped their teacher hubbard stormed out and never returned he left to be with his parents in the far east where his father was stationed with the navy in later life one thing that could throw the irascible hubbard into a rage was the scent of soap in his clothes i was petrified of doing the laundry one former messenger said to protect themselves from a hubbard tirade the messengers rinsed his clothes in 13 separate buckets of water doreen gillham who had who spent her teen years with hubbard never forgot what happened when a longtime aide offered him a freshly laundered shirt after he had taken a shower he immediately grabbed the collar and put it up to his nose then threw it down said gillham who died recently in a horseriding accident he went to the closet and proceeded to sniff all the shirts he would tear them off the hangers and throw them down were talking 30 shirts on the floor he let out a long whine gillham said and then began screaming about the smell i picked up a shirt off the floor smelled it and said there is no soap on this shirt i didnt smell anything in any of them he grudgingly put it on said gillham who added deep down inside im telling myself this guy is nuts gillham said that hubbard had become obsessed not only with soap smells but with dust which aggravated his allergies he demanded whiteglove inspections but never seemed satisfied with the results no matter how clean the room gillham said he would insist that it be dusted over and over and over again gillham formerly one of hubbards most loyal and trusted messengers said his behavior became increasingly erratic after he crashed a motorcycle in the canary islands in the early 1970s he realized his own mortality she said he was in agony for months he insisted with a broken arm and broken ribs that he was going to heal himself and it didnt work according to those who knew him well hubbard was neither affectionate nor much of a family man he seemed closer to his handpicked messengers than to his own seven children one of whom he later denied fathering his kids rarely if ever got to see him gillham said until his wife mary sue insisted on weekly sunday night dinners hubbard expected his children to live up to the family name and do nothing that would reflect badly on him or the church and for that reason his son quentin was a problem quentin had once tried suicide with a drug overdose and was confused about his sexual orientation a fact that was quietly discussed among his friends and at the highest levels of the church he thought quentin was an embarrassment said laurel sullivan hubbards former public relations officer who had a falling out with the organization in 1981 and he told me that several times in 1976 quentin parked on a deserted road in las vegas and piped the exhaust into his car at the age of 22 he killed himself when hubbard was told of the suicide he didnt cry or anything according to a former aide his first reaction she said was to express concern over the possibility of publicity that could be used to discredit scientology hubbard also had problems with another son his namesake l ron hubbard jr hubbard feuded with his eldest son for more than 25 years dating back to 1959 when l ron hubbard jr split with scientology because he said he was not making enough money to support his family in the years that followed he changed his name to ronald dewolfe and accused his father of everything from cavorting with mobsters to abusing drugs for his part hubbard accused his son of being crazy although hubbard cast himself as a humble servant to mankind former assistants said he was not without ego he craved adulation and coveted fame sullivan the former public relations officer recalled how after an appearance he would ask how many minutes of applause did i get how many times did they say hip hip hurray how many people showed up how many letters did i get if you remained in awe of him he was great said sullivan who had a falling out with the church in 1981 if you crossed him or appeared to cross him he would lash out at you scream at you accuse you of things gillham and other former aides said he would accuse even his most devout aides of trying to poison him if he did not like the taste of a meal that had been laboriously prepared for his table somebodys trying to kill me former aides said he would shout what have i done all ive tried to do is help man he envisioned global conspiracies designed to smash scientology and he ingrained this dark view in the minds of his followers through his many writings time and again since 1950 hubbard said in 1982 the vested interests which pretend to run the world for their own appetites and profit have mounted fullscale attacks with a running dog press and slavish government agencies the forces of evil have launched their lies and sought by whatever twisted means to check and destroy scientology our enemies on this planet are less than 12 men he announced in a 1967 taperecorded message to his adherents they are members of the bank of england and other higher financial circles they own and control newspaper chains and they are oddly enough directors in all the mental health groups in the world which have sprung up chief among his suspects were psychiatry and government agencies that probed his organization including interpol the parisbased international police agency the us food and drug administration the internal revenue service and the fbi former scientologist hartwell told the florida hearing that she was present when hubbard made a film about bombing the fbi office i was in makeup and we had so much blood on those actors which was made out of karo syrup and food coloring hartwell said and we couldnt get enough on them to suit hubbard we had guys legs off there were hands off arms i mean it was a mess from the word go even before scientology hubbard believed that unseen forces were against him i watched him operate said dianetics publisher arthur ceppos who later split with hubbard if he felt he was under attack thats when his paranoia showed this siege mentality led hubbard to author a series of church policies on how to combat suspected foes writings that more than any of his others have worked to reinforce scientologys cultish image and undermine its quest for legitimacy he counseled his followers to discredit the opposition to a point of total obliteration and to remember that the thousands of years of jewish passivity earned them nothing but slaughter so things do not run right because one is holy or good things run right because one makes them right in this spirit during the mid1970s scientologists launched nasty smear campaigns and turned to criminality burglarizing private and government offices eventually 11 top scientologists were jailed including hubbards wife mary sue who oversaw the sweeping operation hubbard was named as an unindicted coconspirator at one point during this period fbi agents raided church headquarters in los angeles and washington hubbard and three trusted aides fearing that his enemies had at long last gained the upper hand ran for cover they fled a scientology compound near the town of hemet and drove to sparks nev where they used false names and lived in a nondescript apartment for six months until things cooled off when the raids happened he never really knew what they the fbi had recalled dede reisdorf one of those who accompanied hubbard to disguise hubbards appearance reisdorf said she cut his red hair and dyed it brown he often wore fake glasses donned a phony mustache and pulled a hunters cap down over his ears he got to a point reisdorf said where he wouldnt even walk in front of a window he was afraid of being seen by somebody there was always somebody in a bush somewhere a reporter or an fbi agent or an irs agent it was not the last time hubbard would go into hiding in 1980 on st valentines day hubbard pulled another disappearing act this time he never returned
