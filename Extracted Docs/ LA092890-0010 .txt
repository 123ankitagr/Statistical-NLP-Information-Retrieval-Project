when does a disease become a political issue when it is contagious incurable and kills those who are still vigorous enough to mount a campaign to grab public interest and funding every year 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast disease every year 42,000 women die of it i am not the only person who while watching one more television program on aids has noted that every two years more women die from breast cancer than all the people in the united states who have ever died from aids yet because breast cancer is not a contagious or predictably incurable disease and because women have not yet defined it as a women's issue what should be seen as a major social and political problem is regarded as a tragic and somehow biologically fated part of women's lot this is not to suggest that aids should receive any less attention or funding on the contrary women have a great deal to learn from groups that have successfully publicized and politicized the horror of the aids epidemic but it is time for national women's organizations to comprehend that a disease that afflicts so many women is more than a medical problem it is a social concern entitled to the full force of national activism what for example has caused the incidence of breast cancer to rise from one out of 11 women to one out of 10 is it the result of better detection longer life spans or have environmental pollution oral contraceptives and dietary habits somehow caused a greater proliferation of the disease why do so many doctors and insurance companies fail to encourage or cover preventive mammograms because women are at particular risk breast cancer is a women's issue waiting to be recognized as such this doesn't mean that other problems including abortion rights are any less important but a single-issue orientation has obscured the reality that breast cancer kills women with terrifying frequency in boston and oakland women who have survived cancer have started organizations the cambridge women's community cancer project and the oakland's women's cancer resource center to lobby for better preventive care increased research funding and improved insurance coverage and to provide information and support groups for breast cancer patients other women however should not leave this battle to those who are exhausted from treatment or in the process of dying the national women's health network a national organization that promotes and monitors women's health-care delivery in the united states has testified at congressional hearings that the government must reconsider its current priority of funding research for treatment while ignoring research for prevention they are lobbying for the resumption of a canceled study on the association between dietary fat and breast cancer and for a new study to explore the connections between breast cancer and oral contraceptives there are many obstacles to overcome including those in medical training only 2 of medical students take elective courses in preventive medicine the academic award system rewards those who engage in basic research and technology development rather than those who devote themselves to prevention attention to women's health care moreover is sadly neglected in 1987 the national institutes of health spent less than 14 of its 7.6 billion research budget on women's health issues although women make up more than half the population the general accounting office has reported that national institutes of health has made little progress in including women in research study populations and as a result women's problems are not taken seriously until they reach a critical stage look around you one-tenth of your sisters daughters wives lovers mothers and female friends who manage to survive other life-threatening accidents or diseases will in the course of their lives receive a diagnosis of breast cancer it's time for feminists the public and politicians to grasp that breast cancer is a disease of epidemic proportions that affects enormous numbers of women and hence hundreds of thousands of their children partners and friends this is a silent political constituency waiting to be discovered there is no greater human right than the right to live out one's natural life span
