uncertainty about the ownership of a 17 per cent block of shares in maclean hunter has put an obstacle in the way of rogers communications proposed bid for the toronto-based publishing and cable-tv group rogers which is canada's biggest cable-tv operator was expected on friday to announce the terms of a strategic merger with maclean hunter valued at between cdollars 4 bn pounds 2 bn and cdollars 4.5 bn instead rogers said that it would first ask the ontario securities commission to rule whether it could make an offer for all mh's outstanding shares without including a parcel of 36.3 m shares held by a company known as maclean hunter holdings the commission's decision is expected within a week or two the status of the mh shares held by mh holdings could make a substantial difference to the cost of a takeover bid as well as rogers ability to secure majority approval of all mh shareholders for its offer as required under a poison pill which mh set up in 1989 rogers said the equity of mh holdings is almost entirely owned by two units of maclean hunter itself and mh's financial statements treat the shares held by mh holdings as if they were not outstanding mh holdings was formed by senior maclean hunter managers and former family shareholders after the parent company went public in the 1960 s apparently to help thwart a hostile predator details of its ownership have never been revealed rogers believes that by combining their resources the two companies have a better chance of standing up to international multimedia conglomerates as well as to canada's powerful telephone companies but mh pre-empted its bid early last week by revealing it had received an unsolicited and informal takeover proposal from the cable-tv operator mh has indicated it will not show its cards until rogers puts a firm offer on the table
