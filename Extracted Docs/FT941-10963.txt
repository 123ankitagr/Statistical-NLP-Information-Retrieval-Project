Uncertainty about the ownership of a 17 per cent block of shares in Maclean Hunter has put an obstacle in the way of Rogers Communications ' proposed bid for the Toronto-based publishing and cable-TV group . Rogers , which is Canada 's biggest cable-TV operator , was expected on Friday to announce the terms of a 'strategic merger ' with Maclean Hunter valued at between CDollars 4bn ( Pounds 2bn ) and CDollars 4.5bn . Instead , Rogers said that it would first ask the Ontario Securities Commission to rule whether it could make an offer for all MH 's outstanding shares without including a parcel of 36.3m shares held by a company known as Maclean Hunter Holdings . The commission 's decision is expected within a week or two . The status of the MH shares held by MH Holdings could make a substantial difference to the cost of a takeover bid , as well as Rogers ' ability to secure majority approval of all MH shareholders for its offer , as required under a 'poison pill ' which MH set up in 1989 . Rogers said the equity of MH Holdings is almost entirely owned by two units of Maclean Hunter itself , and MH 's financial statements treat the shares held by MH Holdings as if they were not outstanding . MH Holdings was formed by senior Maclean Hunter managers and former family shareholders after the parent company went public in the 1960s , apparently to help thwart a hostile predator . Details of its ownership have never been revealed . Rogers believes that by combining their resources , the two companies have a better chance of standing up to international multimedia conglomerates , as well as to Canada 's powerful telephone companies . But MH pre-empted its bid early last week by revealing it had received an unsolicited and informal takeover proposal from the cable-TV operator . MH has indicated it will not show its cards until Rogers puts a firm offer on the table .
