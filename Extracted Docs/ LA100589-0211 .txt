do you hesitate when someone asks what your name is or when you come to the part of a form where you're asked to identify yourself if so you might be suffering from an increasingly common disorder called women who have kept their maiden name but sometimes use their husband's when i decided to retain my name nine years ago it didn't seem like a particularly momentous decision i had grown accustomed to it and had no desire to start all over with a new one my husband supported me and understood completely we both agreed however that there were older relatives who would not understand and i would use his name in my dealings with them in retrospect that is how this nightmare started from then on it became easier to do the same in other situations and soon i became a habitual name changer the first real problem we experienced was when we had children and started using baby-sitters naively i gave my name to them without a second thought it was not until they started calling back that the problem surfaced there isn't a mr hazlewood here my husband would explain only to have a confused teen-ager insist she had baby-sat for us once eventually he learned to answer in a noncommittal manner until he learned the purpose of the call things reached an all-time low however when my husband was forced one day to identify himself as mr hazlewood i persuaded him to do this in lieu of a lengthy explanation to the caller he did so with a great deal of embarrassment but refused any further involvement in name swapping finally i relented and started giving my husband's name to baby-sitters another area of contention is the whole problem of reservations we are continually forgetting what name the dinner reservations are under and what name to give the shoe repair service when we go to pick up our shoes one of our biggest fiascoes was in regard to airline reservations for a vacation to seattle my sister who lives in san francisco was boarding there and accompanying us on our vacation she generously donated one of her frequent-flier vouchers in order for me to receive a free trip one of the rules was that only a family member with the same last name could use the ticket so she proceeded to make reservations for the two of us under our common last name as well as for my husband and two children meanwhile my husband who was organizing the trip was also making reservations for all of us for the sake of convenience he had my reservation under his name so we ended up with 10 seats on the plane one evening an angry airline reservation agent telephoned trying to figure out who all these people were i was going through a rather complicated explanation when he finally asked now let me get this straight how many people are really going and which name is really yours then comes kindergarten with endless forms to fill out some do not even have a space for my last name they just assume it is the same as my husband's sometimes i just use the name that fits best in the space given no one seems to care and i'm not sure anyone is reading those forms anyway i knew i was in the name-changing business for good when i volunteered to work in my son's class he had a very traditional teacher a no-nonsense sort of person whom i could never imagine being ms anyone when a mother first works there she is introduced by her child to the whole class i did not realize this until my son started asking some peculiar questions mom what is your name he inquired after school one day he knows the answer but has trouble understanding why everyone else's mother has the same last name as the rest of the family he became increasingly agitated as the day approached for me to go with him he finally admitted he was worried about what name to use when he introduced me here is a boy who has the only duck-tail haircut in his class and he was worrying about being different memories of being young came rushing back the terribly wrong dress i was forced to wear and the unmatched socks i had to wear because one of my five sisters beat me to the sock drawer all those painful moments when the price of being different was too high and so i relented and became mrs slade in matters pertaining to school i stubbornly cling to my name in the midst of all these compromises it helps that i'm not the only one going through this perhaps the best solution is offered by british royalty in that vast multitude of names that prince charles and andrew pronounce at weddings there is not one last name as a matter of fact queen elizabeth's husband gave up his last name when he married her there is no chance of that happening in our household despite the inevitable confusion i intend to keep my dual identity my father who after six daughters finally gave up on his dream of having a son to carry on the family name would be proud
