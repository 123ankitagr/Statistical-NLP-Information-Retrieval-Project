the presidents of the us and south korea are expected to make a lastditch attempt to persuade north korea to abandon its nuclear weapons programme when they meet in washington today in an effort to defuse the mounting tension between north and south korea president bill clinton and president kim youngsam are likely to offer to suspend the joint annual team spirit military exercise in south korea in return they will seek a resumption of international inspections of north korean nuclear facilities and talks on denuclearisation of the korean peninsula the deal could pave the way to settle a dispute sparked by north koreas threat to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty if pyongyang offers proof it has ended its nuclear arms development programme the us has suggested it might grant diplomatic recognition and provide economic aid the latest us initiative follows a statement by north korea that it would consider a package of simultaneous compromises with washington both sides are racing against time a possible declaration in the next few weeks by the international atomic energy agency iaea that north korea has broken nuclear safeguards by refusing to accept inspections could force the un security council to consider economic sanctions on pyongyang that might trigger a hostile response by north korea and lead to a conflict in the most heavilyarmed area on the planet a war on the korean peninsula might last only a month and end in the defeat of north korea but the destruction would be unimaginable a western diplomat said whether such an apocalyptic event will occur depends on north koreas true intentions in provoking the crisis and the wests response to it the prime aim of pyongyangs nuclear weapons programme seems to be to ensure survival of north korea and the ruling family of president kim ilsung north korea is confronting increased problems in the postcold war world its economy has shrunk by an annual 5 per cent in the past three years reports persist of disturbances caused by food shortages abroad collapse of the socialist bloc has left the north isolated as witness the recent 1401 vote in the un general assembly urging pyongyang to comply with nuclear inspections the north has lost the support of one key ally russia and relations have cooled with another china after moscow and beijing set up diplomatic ties with seoul even the norths conventional military force although bigger than the souths is ageing while seoul rapidly modernises its army it is an insecure north korea that views nuclear weapons as the ultimate guarantee of its continued existence its the last card they have left to play says mr adrian fostercarter director of the leeds university korea project but how pyongyang plans to use that card is open to question some of those who favour a hardline approach to the north korean nuclear issue argue that pyongyang may be intent on taking south korea by force once it completes the development of nuclear weapons possession of nuclear missiles aimed at us military bases in japan might force the us to think twice about supporting seoul in a conflict but other analysts believe north korea would never risk invading south korea again as it now lacks powerful allies instead pyongyang is engaged in a highstakes game of diplomatic poker using its nuclear programme as a means to win concessions these would include us diplomatic recognition which would imply international acceptance for the permanent division of korea and western economic aid adding to the uncertainty over north koreas nuclear programme are varying estimates of how close pyongyang is to producing a nuclear weapon us intelligence estimates range from a few months to five years whatever north koreas nuclear intentions are the us has based its opposition to pyongyangs possession on two main grounds one it would deal a blow to efforts to stop nuclear proliferation north koreas acquisition of nuclear weapons despite being a signatory to the nuclear safeguards treaty would encourage others to violate the agreement two the us fears a renegade north korea could provoke a nuclear arms race in northeast asia by forcing seoul and tokyo to follow suit pyongyang might also emerge as a supplier of nuclear technology to other antiwestern nations the us has few options to stop north koreas nuclear programme a preemptive attack on the norths yongbyon nuclear facilities is highly unlikely it would almost certainly precipitate an attack on south korea economic sanctions are also questionable china may veto a sanctions resolution in the un as it tries to extend its influence in the region by protecting north korea the us is urging beijing to support sanctions if chinas efforts to intercede with the north koreans fail even if sanctions are imposed they could be ineffective north koreas border with china its chief outside source of oil and food is porous moreover sanctions could provoke an attack by north korea sanctions are regarded as being perilously close to an engagement of war and the north may see no alternative but to fight one diplomat said for this reason china south korea and japan are urging the us to be cautious over sanctions the us so far has pursued a conciliatory approach to solving the nuclear inspection issue but pressure is growing in washington for the clinton administration to adopt a tougher approach if north korea refuses to accept iaea inspections soon the clinton administration is already being criticised for being weak on foreign policy to some in washington the offers to north korea smack of appeasement i dont know if the administration could sell diplomatic recognition to the us public and media even if north korea accepts full inspections one us official says if north korea is engaged in diplomatic brinkmanship it may have to decide soon whether to accept the present package of us concessions instead of holding out for more and risking seeing them disappear washington and pyongyang may be seriously seeking a negotiated solution to the dispute but the situation is still fraught with possibilities for miscalculation and for conflict
