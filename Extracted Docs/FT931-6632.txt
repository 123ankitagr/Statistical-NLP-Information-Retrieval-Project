the government is about to announce that it is planning to privatise the docklands light railway which links the city of london with canary wharf and stratford in east london the move is likely to reinforce suspicions that privatisation could extend beyond british rail to smaller urban systems such as london underground and the tyne wear metro however the department of transport said that privatising the docklands light railway would require separate legislation from the railways bill currently going through parliament the move was foreshadowed in the conservative party's general election manifesto last year which said the government would seek to privatise the docklands light railway during the present parliament's lifetime until recently the commitment had been considered to be lying dormant because of the railway's unreliability and because the failure of the canary wharf development meant it would carry far fewer passengers than expected however the government is now about to appoint the management consultancy arm of ernst young the accountants to draw up a list of options for fulfilling the manifesto commitment if a stock market flotation or outright sale is chosen the railway's new owners will need continuing subsidies because the railway costs six times as much to run as it collects in fares an alternative would be to privatise it in the same way as br by inviting the private sector to bid for a franchise to operate the railway the contract would go to the company requiring the lowest subsidy the docklands light railway cost pounds 77 m to build from its opening in 1987, its performance was disrupted by an pounds 800 m expansion programme to cope with the increased demands that were expected to be created by the canary wharf development one reason the government wants to press ahead with privatisation is because of the need to fund a proposed pounds 130 m extension of the railway from the southern tip of the isle of dogs to lewisham in south-east london the government would like the extension to be privately funded and the simplest way to achieve that would be to have the line built by the private-sector owner of the rest of the railway
