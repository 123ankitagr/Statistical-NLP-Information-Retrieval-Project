One of my most memorable jobs as a young reporter on The Times was to spend a night in Rowton House , a hostel for homeless men . It was deeply unpleasant . One of the largest of these hostels left in London today is Arlington House which is near my home . Passing by frequently , and seeing the sad inhabitants coming and going , I shall watch What Do You Expect - Paradise ? with particular interest . Part of Channel 4 's ' Gim me Shelter' season , this 60-minute programme ( 9.00 ) was made by Rex Bloomstein who has an impressive record with fly-on-the-wall documentaries . BBC1 screens a revised version of Rock Bottom ( 8.00 ) , a programme originally shown as part of BBC2 's 'TV Hell ' evening last year , in which John Peel selects his top 10 weird and worst novelty records . Horizon visits the Gobi Desert with American scientists who are looking for fossil evidence that dinosaurs evolved into birds ( 8.00 BBC2 ) . ITV shows the last episode of September Song , a sentimental drama about two middle-aged men , of a quality that has helped banish some fears about programme standards in the new ITV .
