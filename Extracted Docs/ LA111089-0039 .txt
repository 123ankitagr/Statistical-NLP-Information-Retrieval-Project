Timothy Burns , longtime headmaster at La Jolla Country Day School , on Thursday told the faculty that he plans to resign to return to the Los Angeles area and pursue other career opportunities . As director of the private school for almost 10 years , Burns ' tenure was perhaps best known for his decisions earlier this year that led to an arrangement in which Sharon Rogers ended her relationship as a fourth-grade teacher at the school . The wife of Navy Capt . Will Rogers III , Sharon Rogers and the school reached a mutual agreement in which she was paid to leave the school because of concerns about safety on the campus . In March , she was the target of a bombing while driving her van to school . Mark Saxon , president of the school 's board of trustees , said the departure was not related to criticism of Burns for his handling of the Rogers affair . Instead , Saxon said , Burns wants to rejoin his family in Pasadena and consider new career objectives . Burns could not be reached for comment Thursday about his resignation , which takes effect at the end of the current school year . But , in a letter Thursday to the board president , he said `` the time is simply good for me to explore new and different challenges . ''
