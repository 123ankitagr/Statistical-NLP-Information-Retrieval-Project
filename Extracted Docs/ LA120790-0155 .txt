Emergency medicine -- A Nov. 19 article about tensions between two specialties involved in the care of trauma patients at County-USC Medical Center erroneously reported that emergency medicine was recognized with its own specialty board examinations only a year ago . In fact , the American Board of Emergency Medicine has been empowered to certify doctors as emergency medicine specialists for 10 years . New powers granted a year ago governed examinations certifying expertise in subspecialties of emergency medicine .
