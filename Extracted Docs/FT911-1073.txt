There are too many places to have a pint in Ireland . The Irish Vintners Federation says the proliferation of pubs in the country is causing many landlords serious hardship . In County Cavan , one village has 11 bars - chasing the business of only 100 drinkers . In Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon there are 32 bars , a hotel and an off-licence for a population of only 1,400 . The vintners say there should be fewer pubs , but longer opening hours to cater for those with long thirsts .
