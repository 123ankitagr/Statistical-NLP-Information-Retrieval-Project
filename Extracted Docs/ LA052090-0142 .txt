About 40 domestic flights were canceled and international traffic was delayed up to three hours after air traffic controllers refused to work overtime Friday , officials said . `` At the moment it is impossible to say for how long this situation will continue , '' said Rune Andersson , chief of air traffic control at Arlanda airport outside Stockholm . The controllers are negotiating for higher pay for the extra hours , saying they are short-staffed because authorities failed to anticipate increased air traffic .
