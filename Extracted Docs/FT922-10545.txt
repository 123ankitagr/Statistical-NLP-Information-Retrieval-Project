CHANNEL 4 is likely to increase its share of advertising when it starts selling its own air time next year , according to James Capel , the stockbrokers . The ITV companies presently sell Channel 4 's advertising air time and pay a subscription of 17 per cent of advertising revenue to fund both Channel 4 and the Welsh fourth channel , S4C . From next year the government will fund S4C , which has had advertising revenues of about Pounds 4m a year . Mr Neil Blackley , media analyst at James Capel , believes that next year Channel 4 will be able to earn 17.6 per cent of terrestrial advertising revenue in its own right , with the possibility of winning a greater share if it retains its audience .
