the engineer in the garden by colin tudge jonathan cape pounds 1799 398 pages as bernard shaw said to ellen terry yes but what if our children had my looks and your brains genetic engineering promises to help them out it can also change the plants and animals we share the earth with what is genetic engineering it sounds easy a strip of material carrying genetic information is snipped from one organism and patched into another the cells enzymes tidy up what genetic engineering offers is a cross between the specific genes of any life form with any other life form for humans all we have to do is sort out the 100000 genes divided or scattered into 3 billion base pairs each one does something different colin tudge has written a frustrating book the engineer in the garden which charts the history and state of genetic engineering equipped with a glossary of genetic terms and a few idiot guides a reader would have some chance but tudge makes it hard going the information is embedded like small fossils in the bedrock of the prose there is no list of further reading no page of notes and no chronological table of genetic science these serious doubts aside this can be a rewarding book tudge starts with darwin on natural selection 1859 and arrives at crick and watson on the molecular structure of nucleic acids a structure for deoxyribose nucleic acid dna in 1953 then come the molecular biologists and michael crichtons dna chains on screen at jurassic park en route tudge treats no question as trivial and delivers masses of information but the result confused while we learn about bees gannets deer peacocks and crocodile eggs tudge moves between scientific practice and its history he covers the moral issues which surround dna fingerprinting and genetic enhancement he invokes the twin imperatives of hubris and blasphemy which seem to be the only concepts developed enough to counter an unchecked drive into a geneticised future one piece of good news since dna in men and women behaves differently neither gender is superfluous neither is sex or at least there is now an alluring scent called dna in a doublehelix shaped bottle tudge steers clear of the commercial concerns which drive the research but gene technology with bioengineering have a future as limitless as life itself last months regulation of the united kingdom biotechnology industry and global competitiveness suggested that food containing genetically engineered organisms need not be labelled for consumers it also pointed out that excessively precautionary and unscientific regulations might be handicapping the uk biotechnology industry alongside less stringent controls in the us and japan but how is the human species doing genetically tudge has a good chapter on human improvability darwin knew rightly that each species has descent with modification we are bigger taller healthier than we used to be but why are not we all bach or einstein or freud is there a gene which causes absentmindedness in the same sense as there is a gene which causes blue eyes or wrinkles the human genome project predicts a map of every gene in the body inside ten years already inherited deafness cystic fibrosis and sicklecell anemia have been linked to single genes and now the genes which cause inherited breast cancer have been traced to positions on the chromosome give or take half a million pairs tudges book follows the genre evolved by richard dawkins and stephen jay gould intellectual scientific commentary as more books like this one emerge we should recognise that intellectual and scientist are gradually and rightly converging in the public mind the arty side of cp snows two cultures will have to adapt to survive in a hostile world house of lords select committee on science and technology 7th report paper 80 hmso pounds 2100
