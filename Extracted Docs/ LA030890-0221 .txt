i enjoy the writings of mike downey and often find his work very humorous on monday i was deeply moved by mike's piece and found it difficult to finish reading it my younger brother paul a student at santa clara university was so amazed by hank gathers performances that he nicknamed him f-gathers as in an f-4 fighter jet i used to like that nickname but we'll use it no more our fighter has been shot down we will all miss hank the basketball player but mostly we will miss hank the person bill komar playa del rey
