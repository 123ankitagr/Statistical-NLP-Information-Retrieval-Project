I enjoy the writings of Mike Downey and often find his work very humorous . On Monday , I was deeply moved by Mike 's piece and found it difficult to finish reading it . My younger brother , Paul , a student at Santa Clara University , was so amazed by Hank Gathers ' performances that he nicknamed him `` F-Gathers , '' as in an F-4 fighter jet . I used to like that nickname , but we 'll use it no more . Our fighter has been shot down . We will all miss Hank the basketball player , but mostly we will miss Hank the person .
