San Diego State 's baseball team has had numerous rallies in its 52-year history , but none quite like the one it had Saturday afternoon at Charlie Smith Field . There were no runs , no hits and no men left on base , but the rally held to determine the baseball program 's standing in the community netted approximately 3,500 people . An anonymous donor , who pledged an unspecified but significant amount of money to build a 4,000-seat baseball stadium , and Athletic Director Fred Miller wanted to know what kind of support SDSU baseball had in the community . Baseball , as well as a number of other sports at SDSU , have been hit with financial cuts because of an athletic department deficit exceeding $ 500,000 . There has been talk of discontinuing the baseball program . `` We were geared up for maybe a thousand people , and we had about 3,200 , '' said an ecstatic Jim Dietz , SDSU 's coach . `` We had enough sign-up sheets for 3,200 , and we ran out . I was stunned . It went way beyond my expectations . '' Dietz added that there were about 2,000 additional pieces of mail on his desk , many of which were from fans indicating they could not attend because of other commitments . The 2 1/2-hour program included the unveiling of the stadium plans , a memorabilia stand , a professionally-edited highlight video and the appearances of many former Aztecs , including Tony Gwynn of the Padres and the Cleveland Indians ' Bud Black . Asked if the turnout surprised him , Black said , `` In a way yes . In a way no . Nothing Jim does surprises me . '' Said Gwynn , `` I understand that college is now a business . . . but for them to even consider giving up baseball is really tough to swallow . '' JIM LINDGREN
