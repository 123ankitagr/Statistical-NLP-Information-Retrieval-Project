only one thing stands between the average person and their computer a keyboard although most people feel happiest communicating with each other through speech voice interfaces for computers are viewed as a technology very much for the future the computer industry has grappled with this dilemma for at least 20 years periodically computers which are designed to be controlled with digitised voice commands are designed and sold to a small number of users and the most successful use of voice in computing to date has been found in specially-built military systems where voice is used to control aircraft and radar equipment and in speech synthesis systems for the disabled in business voice technology is already being widely used for telephone-based services such as voice messaging retailers can replace human telephone operators with a voice messaging system then accept orders placed from customers who key in relevant numbers on tone dialling telephones hospitals and other commercial organisations are using internal telephone exchanges to manage this type of voice messaging application text files such as railway timetables and stock market reports can be digitised and broadcast over telephone and computer networks small businesses and private homes also benefit from new digital exchanges and voice data networks now being installed by british telecom across the uk the fact that most exchanges can store digitised voice locally on computer disks means that bt can try out new services such as call minder this tells incoming callers if the number they want is busy then invites them to leave a voice message other applications for voice in business have always been limited by the cost of computer hardware storing digitised voice is a resource-hungry business with one minute of uncompressed speech taking up one megabit of disk storage another problem is processing speed if a computer is to recognise the words being spoken to it it must have some way of checking spoken words against a known vocabulary such a vocabulary swallows up disk space and the act of matching word to voice dictionary requires a fast computer processor but the fact that the cost of pc and unix hardware has fallen so dramatically over the past year or two is bringing new voice related applications onto the desktop an example of this new breed of voice-activated application is shakespeare speechwriter a word processor and document handler that can be controlled wholly or partially through voice commands speechwriter allows users to dictate documents to their pc which then displays words on-screen almost as quickly as they are spoken software converts spoken words into digitised data which can be stored on the pc's hard disk shakespeare expects that key users of the new system will be middle and senior managers who can create documents without using the keyboard and sales order processing departments which normally type or write down incoming telephone enquiries shakespeare will sell speechwriter as an all-in-one voice processor which will include a beefed-up compaq 80486 pc and software for around pounds 5,000 although there will be more applications of this type on offer in the future most software for the pc that uses voice is still fairly limited the most it can normally do is to accept voice commands to open or close windows on the screen or to record and play short voice annotations software packages written for apple's system 7 operating system or for microsoft windows 3.1 which now includes voice capabilities let users with a suitably equipped pc record short messages the message can be included within a word processing or electronic mail document where it is shown as a special icon when the document is read by somebody else they can click on the sound icon and hear the message this kind of voice annotation is particularly useful when users want to be more expressive in the message they are sending or wish to draw attention to a particular part of the document the fact that microsoft has included support for voice in windows means that there will soon be a critical mass of users able to make the most of voice in everyday business applications another factor will be the increasing trend for pc and workstation hardware manufacturers to build voice capability into their products just the beginning one of these manufacturers is compaq which recently said that it would include business audio as a standard feature in its middle and top end deskpro products deskpro pcs now include a sound chip and a microphone allowing users to both record and play back digitised voice but as compaq's desktop product manager sue forkin explains this is just the beginning for multimedia in pcs the way in which voice is used so far in computing is still fairly rudimentary and artificial in the future voice will be much more useful particularly in security systems along with multimedia security is one of today's hot topics in voice technology the fact is that a voice print is as individual to one person as a fingerprint it means that voice will be extremely useful in the control of everyday items such as automated teller machines atms as well as office systems like fax machines instead of using complex commands and remote controls customers will control such systems simply by talking to them but the key benefits of voice interfaces of the future will be freedom for users who will be able to operate computers hands-free' and the removal of the keyboard barrier for it-shy managers bearing in mind the fact that people type at rates from a slow 25 words per minute wpm but speak at around 200 wpm speech input can also bring productivity benefits all round the fact is that the keyboard has been a limiting feature in computing for far too long concludes mike patrick of digital equipment uk voice interfaces have a great deal of potential because voice is the key method of communication for most people
