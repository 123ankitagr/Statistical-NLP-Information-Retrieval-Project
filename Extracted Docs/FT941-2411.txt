five years ago coffee and cocoa farmers worldwide were leaving crops to rot in the fields after a spectacular collapse in commodity prices today the picture is different as prices for soft commodities such as coffee sugar and cocoa are surging encouraging financial investors to turn their attention to these previously unsophisticated markets prices have been buoyed by crop difficulties rising consumption and declining world stocks for coffee and cocoa the end to the recession in many countries is expected to fuel demand rising prices and an upturn in speculative interest in the soft commodity markets has resulted in financial investors returning to commodities after an absence of several years new capital is increasingly focused on commodities and this is reflected by growing exchange membership among international finance houses and banks says mr robin woodhead chief executive of the london commodity exchange poor returns expected on world bond markets have also encouraged institutional investors to put cash into commodities even the metals markets where world stocks remain high are benefiting from renewed interest in basic commodities but it is not just speculation that is fuelling this years rise in the soft commodity markets coffee cocoa and sugar crops are all expected to be lower than forecasts for world consumption leading to a deficit to be made up from stockpiles cocoa prices reached a fiveyear high at the end of last year with prices breaching pounds 1000 a tonne on the london commodity exchange after forecasts of a growing shortfall in production prices remain firmly above pounds 950 a tonne and production is expected to be between 120000 and 170000 tonnes lower than consumption the international sugar organisation last week revised its deficit forecast to 24m tonnes this year just over 2 per cent of world consumption from 14m tonnes in december prices have risen by almost 20 per cent for both raw and white sugar with the may futures contract at new yorks coffee sugar and cocoa exchange reaching over 12 cents per lb last week similarly coffee prices hit their highest level for 19 months last week when the lces second position futures contract touched dollars 1341 a tonne coffee prices have also received a boost from the operation of a producers retention scheme last october 40 coffeeproducing countries put together a plan to withhold up to 20 per cent of supplies from the export market until prices increased this followed a dramatic collapse in the coffee market when prices fell to their lowest level since 1974 the retention scheme has been successful in adding to investors fears of a squeeze on stocks goldman sachs the us investment bank works out production costs for commodities each month this shows a price below which it is not economic to continue production by this measure commodity prices overall are 7 per cent undervalued when compared with the costs of production cocoa prices are 5 per cent below the costs of production and sugar prices 4 per cent lower however goldman reckons coffee prices are 15 per cent higher than production costs as the producers retention scheme has begun to bite goldman points out that the low valuation of some commodities makes them a good investment opportunity but not everyone is happy about the appearance of futures funds and speculators in the traditionally gentlemanly commodity markets the extra cash can exaggerate a market move and some traders complain that the soft commodity markets are becoming dominated by fund activity funds can push a market but it is not the case that these markets are bucking fundamental trends said mr lawrence eagles commodity analyst at gni the london brokerage house
