the sydney morning herald's main story yesterday headlined pm sends kiwis dollars 500 m welfare bill was accompanied by a cartoon showing a new zealander lying on an australian beach and saying he had emigrated because job opportunities were better there almost all australia's daily newspapers carried front-page reports of a briefing by one of mr paul keating's senior aides on the agenda for the prime minister's four-day visit to new zealand which starts in wellington today the media coverage reflects australian prejudices about new zealanders who are widely believed to have taken an unfair advantage of reciprocal immigration and social security arrangements between the two countries however the story was regarded with puzzlement in wellington where mr keating's visit is regarded as an opportunity to ease recent strains in the bilateral relationship in particular mr keating was thought to want to soothe resentment caused by labor's occasionally vitriolic criticism of new zealand's free market economic policies in the run-up to the australian federal election in march ironically the growing australian resentment about new zealand immigrants has been accompanied by rapid progress towards economic integration following the 1983 closer economic relations cer agreement studies show that both cer and the parallel trans tasman travel agreement which guarantees free movement of australian and new zealand citizens have delivered net benefits to both countries free trade in manufactured goods was established in 1990, and bilateral trade is growing at 12 per cent a year however the greatest benefits have accrued to new zealand which now sends 19 per cent of its exports to australia as a result the relationship with australia has become a high priority for new zealand which virtually ignored its larger neighbour until the 1980 s in spite of their shared history as former british colonies mr jim bolger the conservative new zealand prime minister would also like a successful round of talks to improve his image in the approach to a difficult election later this year however there are a number of areas in which agreement may be difficult new zealand wants to see rapid progress on second generation cer issues such as harmonisation of standards corporate taxation law business law and investment rules it also wants greater access to markets such as telecommunications coastal shipping and insurance some progress has been made partly as a result of the inclusion of new zealand ministers in most of australia's ministerial councils which co-ordinate federal and state government approaches to such issues but mr bolger will be seeking an indication that harmonisation remains a priority for australia and that the speed of reform will be increased by the re-elected labor government in particular new zealand would like to tie up an agreement on pre-clearance for airline passengers which has been held up by australian concerns about new zealand's visa requirements for third countries mr bolger will try to defuse the welfare row by agreeing to a review of reciprocal social security arrangements especially for pensioners but he will resist any attempt to weaken the free travel agreement the australian government has been under pressure from its trade union allies to restrict access for some workers especially sheep shearers who are accused of undercutting established wage rates canberra has been perturbed by new zealand's support of the north american free trade agreement which australia sees as a potential threat to japan its biggest trading partner new zealand has worked hard behind the scenes to allay australian fears but mr keating will be seeking assurances that wellington remains committed to the integration of both australasian economies into the asia pacific region mr bolger who returned on tuesday from a trip to japan china and south korea said last week that he was comfortable with wellington's increasingly close relationship with asia new zealand's trade is more geographically diversified than australia's and wellington is less enthusiastic than canberra about the prospects for regional trading organisations such as the australian-inspired asia pacific economic co-operation process new zealand's nine-year-old anti-nuclear legislation which bars visits by nuclear armed or powered ships has reduced the effectiveness of the anzus defence pact which links australia new zealand and the us mr bolger would like to repeal the legislation but is unable to do so because it is strongly supported by voters of all parties as a result the us has suspended exercises with the new zealand armed forces restricting its access to intelligence and military equipment canberra has continued bilateral defence links with new zealand which include a joint frigate programme but australian ministers have recently made clear that they will not support a return to three-way exercises until the nuclear ban is abandoned mr keating may also express concern about the falling level of new zealand defence spending which has been capped for three years because of budget constraints there is one area in which the two leaders will be in complete agreement both want to see a rapid conclusion to the uruguay round talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade both countries would gain substantially from liberalisation of agricultural trade and the talks are likely to conclude with a joint appeal to the us and the european community to stop bickering over the details
