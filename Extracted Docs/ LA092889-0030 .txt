Carson City Clerk Helen Kawagoe 's decision to invalidate an initiative petition against the city 's mobile-home rent control law has been upheld by a state appellate court . In the decision , handed down Monday , the judges ruled that Kawagoe was correct in throwing out more than 200 signatures . Kawagoe 's disqualifications left the petition short of the 10 % of registered voters needed to qualify a measure for the ballot . The measure would have retained existing rent control for mobile-home tenants meeting federal poverty guidelines while phasing them out for others over a two-year period . Park owners , who supported the petition drive , argued that the city 's rent control ordinance prevents them from making a fair profit . Mobile-home owners say they would not be able to pay steep increases in rent for their spaces . Kawagoe , who lives in a Carson mobile-home park , said she felt vindicated by the decision .
