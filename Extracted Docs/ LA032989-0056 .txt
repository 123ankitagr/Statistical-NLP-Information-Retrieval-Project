Billionaire H. Ross Perot , saying the nation 's capital has some of the nation 's worst schools , urged local business leaders Tuesday to pitch in and help fight the city 's murder , drug and crime epidemic . `` Get out of your fancy house , '' Perot said . `` Get down there where the rubber meets the road . . . and say , 'Let 's fix this ; let 's help these folks . ' `` It 's pure self-interest , if I ca n't get you excited any other way , because you 're helping the tax base , '' he said . Perot , a colorful and controversial Texas businessman , spoke to more than 500 Washington-area business leaders who support the Salvation Army at the charitable group 's annual district luncheon . He cited Washington 's surge in drug-related slayings , which have given it the highest per capita murder rate in the nation . `` You say , 'What can I do ? ' Here 's what you can do . You can clean up the schools in this town . You can clean up streets in this town . You can make it a safe place for people to live . ''
