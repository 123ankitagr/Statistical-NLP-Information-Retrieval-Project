I am shocked to read that professionals who deal with children believe that `` children do n't lie . '' Where on earth are their real-life experiences with children ? And do n't they know of Lawrence Kohlberg 's famous study at Harvard that shows that children do n't develop a moral code until they are 7 or 8 ? Has n't anyone considered the possibility that the children were playing doctor and that the little girl , rather than saying , `` We were playing doctor and I enjoyed it , '' projected onto the little boy 's father the injury ? I admire the Johnsons for insisting that their story be told . HELEN COLTON Los Angeles
