Nice to see Britain 's armed forces boosting their clientele bases . For , having honed their own expertise in shedding personnel over the past two years , they are now being retained to help the Russians deal with the effects of doing the very same . Under an agreement signed yesterday in Moscow by defence secretary Malcolm Rifkind , Russians will receive lessons in how to set up redundant officers happily in Civvy Street . So , after many years teaching citizens of developing countries how to fight communism , Britain will now be training post-Soviet Russians how to be civilians .
