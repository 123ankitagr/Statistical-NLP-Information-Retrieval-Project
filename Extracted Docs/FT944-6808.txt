there was encouraging news for the german bond market last week growth in october's m3 money supply worked out at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent suggesting the bundesbank will come close to meeting its target of 4 to 6 per cent m3 growth for the year year-on-year inflation was down to 2.6 per cent in november further progress towards the bundesbank's 2 per cent objective the favourable outlook is blighted somewhat by continuing uncertainty over german fiscal policy which cannot be cleared up until after the tight 1995 budget has been agreed later this month the wage round for next year presents another risk but given the backdrop of improving inflation and money supply data it is not absurd to suggest that the bundesbank may cut short-term rates one last time during the current economic cycle perhaps early next year to some extent it does not matter whether short-term rates are cut or not sentiment towards bunds will improve even if rates are merely left on hold throughout most of 1995 this seems more likely than the monetary tightening still anticipated by the euromarkets improving fundamentals have helped bunds over recent months they have regained their traditional premium to comparable us issues the outperformance is more marked for us investors because of the weakness of the dollar versus the d-mark this may encourage profit-taking at signs of a pronounced rally but if last week's tentative worldwide shift from equities into bonds gathers momentum bunds will clearly benefit
