There was encouraging news for the German bond market last week . Growth in October 's M3 money supply worked out at an annualised rate of 6.9 per cent , suggesting the Bundesbank will come close to meeting its target of 4 to 6 per cent M3 growth for the year . Year-on-year inflation was down to 2.6 per cent in November - further progress towards the Bundesbank 's 2 per cent objective . The favourable outlook is blighted somewhat by continuing uncertainty over German fiscal policy , which can not be cleared up until after the tight 1995 budget has been agreed later this month . The wage round for next year presents another risk . But , given the backdrop of improving inflation and money supply data , it is not absurd to suggest that the Bundesbank may cut short-term rates one last time during the current economic cycle , perhaps early next year . To some extent it does not matter whether short-term rates are cut or not ; sentiment towards bunds will improve even if rates are merely left on hold throughout most of 1995 . This seems more likely than the monetary tightening still anticipated by the Euromarkets . Improving fundamentals have helped bunds over recent months ; they have regained their traditional premium to comparable US issues . The outperformance is more marked for US investors because of the weakness of the dollar versus the D-Mark . This may encourage profit-taking at signs of a pronounced rally , but if last week 's tentative worldwide shift from equities into bonds gathers momentum , bunds will clearly benefit .
