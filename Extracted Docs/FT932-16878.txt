IMPORTS OF cattle from the Czech and Slovak republics were banned by the Ministry of Agriculture yesterday after positive tests for foot and mouth disease . The ban also applies to pigs , deer , sheep , goats and other susceptible cloven-hoofed animals . There have been 51 outbreaks of the disease in Italy this year , with eastern Europe suspected as the source , and thousands of animals have been slaughtered . The ministry said the positive tests did not necessarily indicate that animals were infected , as those vaccinated against the disease showed a similar reaction .
