Elf Aquitaine , the French oil company , has sold a 10 per cent stake in Enterprise Oil , the UK company which earlier this year failed in its hostile bid for fellow explorer Lasmo . Elf raised Pounds 187.5m from the placing of 50.8m shares at 369p , representing 10.3 per cent of Enterprise . The placing price of 369p compares with an Enterprise share price of 451p before the bid for Lasmo . The sale was widely expected after Elf 's decision earlier this year to re-classify the Enterprise holding as non-core . Elf has set a target for this year of FFr5bn ( Pounds 590m ) from the sale of such assets , as part of a restructuring programme . Elf continues to hold 12.9 per cent of Enterprise through the joint venture company Elf Enterprise Petroleum . The company said yesterday 's sale would not affect the joint venture , which operates three North Sea fields and the Flotta oil terminal in the Orkney Islands . Elf has a two-thirds share in the joint company . Mr Andrew Shilston , finance director of Enterprise Oil , said : 'The disposal of this block of shares should not be interpreted to mean the unravelling of the joint venture . Both Elf and Enterprise are content that it should continue to exist . ' Elf Enterprise Petroleum was formed in 1991 to buy out the North Sea assets of Occidental , the US group , for Pounds 800m . It was attacked by Lasmo during Enterprise 's unsuccessful bid . Lasmo claimed the venture had been ' a disastrous investment ' , with losses of Pounds 238m in 1993 , debts of Pounds 1bn and gearing of more than 200 per cent . Mr Shilston said Enterprise became aware several weeks ago that Elf intended to place its stake . Under a shareholders ' agreement , Elf had to consult Enterprise over the placing and could not sell the shares to any one buyer . Mr Shilston said he did not know which institutions had taken up the shares .
