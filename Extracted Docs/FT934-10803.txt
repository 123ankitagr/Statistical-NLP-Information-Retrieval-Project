all but 2 per cent of dubai's energy requirements are met by gas but for the government with its strategy of creating a long-term self-sustaining economy based on the tripod of traditional imports and re-exports tourism and further development of dubai as a regional services and light industries centre there can never be enough energy nor is it satisfactory for dubai to be dependent on only one or two sources of supply some gas reaches dubai's generators from the four off-shore oilfields which provide the bulk of dubai's oil and gas revenues fateh south west fateh falah and rashid output from the first two has averaged some 200,000 barrels a day and 190,000 b d respectively output from the last two is some 10,000 b d each the concession holder is dubai petroleum company dpc consisting of the us's conoco the operator france's total the spanish company repsol and two german companies rwe germany's sixth-largest industrial group and its biggest electricity generator and gas company wintershall conoco-dpc lifts and markets the crude dubai sets the price it also markets four or five cargoes a month each containing some 1 2 m barrels so that when traded the government knows what price dpc should also be getting dubai treats crude oil as just another commodity with the sole purpose being to maximise value the approximate published price for mid-october was dollars 15.23 a barrel dubai gets its revenue from taxes and royalties levied on dpc since last april a pilot scheme has operated to inject 100 m cu ft a day of gas to enhance recovery signs are that the scheme is proving positive and that recoverable crude reserves are greater than originally foreseen the reinjection scheme is due to run until 2038 associated gas is also piped to dubai natural gas company's processing plant at jebel ali most of the liquids butane propane and condensate are separated and shipped to japanese buyers some of the liquid gas goes to dubai's own products company emirates petroleum products company which operates its own petrol stations a dollars 2 bn refinery with a capacity of 250,000 b d almost all of which would be for export at jebel ali is still being considered potential markets are in india east asia and the east coast of africa such a refinery would also enable dubai to be self-sufficient in petroleum products or at least less dependent on abu dhabi even allowing for the anticipated surge in demand some of the dry gas about 130 m cu ft a day is used by dugas itself some goes to power generators at dubai's aluminium smelter and to dubai city the onshore gas and condensate field operated at margham by atlantic richfield produces some 35,000 b d of condensate and can produce 400 m cu ft a day of gas this is all reinjected to maintain reservoir pressure except when in high summer dubai itself needs extra gas supplies for generators in this case up to 150 m cu ft a day is available most of dubai's energy requirements are met by the neighbouring emirate of sharjah where the sajaa gas and condensate field is operated by amoco under an agreement signed in may 1985, dubai receives 140m-250m cu ft a day depending on seasonal demand in dubai for this it is thought to have paid something less than dollars 1.25 per million cubic feet amoco has recently found more gas and condensate other smaller gas supplies reach dubai from sharjah's offshore mubarak field dubai's energy needs last summer averaged 315 m cu ft a day with the annual average being about 230 m cu ft a day but energy demand is rising almost 20 per cent a year and one estimate puts dubai's summer consumption in the next few years at 500 m cu ft a day if present growth rates are maintained for the time being this demand can be met from existing sources but the narrow spread of suppliers is causing concern added to which gas from sajaa and margham may not last more than 10-15 years dubai has to find other sources of energy sporadic talks have been held for some time with abu dhabi qatar and iran but no agreements have yet been reached
