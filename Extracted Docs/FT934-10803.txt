all but 2 per cent of dubais energy requirements are met by gas but for the government with its strategy of creating a longterm selfsustaining economy based on the tripod of traditional imports and reexports tourism and further development of dubai as a regional services and light industries centre there can never be enough energy nor is it satisfactory for dubai to be dependent on only one or two sources of supply some gas reaches dubais generators from the four offshore oilfields which provide the bulk of dubais oil and gas revenues fateh south west fateh falah and rashid output from the first two has averaged some 200000 barrels a day and 190000 bd respectively output from the last two is some 10000 bd each the concession holder is dubai petroleum company dpc consisting of the uss conoco the operator frances total the spanish company repsol and two german companies rwe germanys sixthlargest industrial group and its biggest electricity generator and gas company wintershall conocodpc lifts and markets the crude dubai sets the price it also markets four or five cargoes a month each containing some 12 m barrels so that when traded the government knows what price dpc should also be getting dubai treats crude oil as just another commodity with the sole purpose being to maximise value the approximate published price for midoctober was dollars 1523 a barrel dubai gets its revenue from taxes and royalties levied on dpc since last april a pilot scheme has operated to inject 100m cu ft a day of gas to enhance recovery signs are that the scheme is proving positive and that recoverable crude reserves are greater than originally foreseen the reinjection scheme is due to run until 2038 associated gas is also piped to dubai natural gas companys processing plant at jebel ali most of the liquids butane propane and condensate are separated and shipped to japanese buyers some of the liquid gas goes to dubais own products company emirates petroleum products company which operates its own petrol stations a dollars 2bn refinery with a capacity of 250000 bd almost all of which would be for export at jebel ali is still being considered potential markets are in india east asia and the east coast of africa such a refinery would also enable dubai to be selfsufficient in petroleum products or at least less dependent on abu dhabi even allowing for the anticipated surge in demand some of the dry gas about 130m cu ft a day is used by dugas itself some goes to power generators at dubais aluminium smelter and to dubai city the onshore gas and condensate field operated at margham by atlantic richfield produces some 35000 bd of condensate and can produce 400m cu ft a day of gas this is all reinjected to maintain reservoir pressure except when in high summer dubai itself needs extra gas supplies for generators in this case up to 150m cu ft a day is available most of dubais energy requirements are met by the neighbouring emirate of sharjah where the sajaa gas and condensate field is operated by amoco under an agreement signed in may 1985 dubai receives 140m250m cu ft a day depending on seasonal demand in dubai for this it is thought to have paid something less than dollars 125 per million cubic feet amoco has recently found more gas and condensate other smaller gas supplies reach dubai from sharjahs offshore mubarak field dubais energy needs last summer averaged 315m cu ft a day with the annual average being about 230m cu ft a day but energy demand is rising almost 20 per cent a year and one estimate puts dubais summer consumption in the next few years at 500m cu ft a day if present growth rates are maintained for the time being this demand can be met from existing sources but the narrow spread of suppliers is causing concern added to which gas from sajaa and margham may not last more than 1015 years dubai has to find other sources of energy sporadic talks have been held for some time with abu dhabi qatar and iran but no agreements have yet been reached
