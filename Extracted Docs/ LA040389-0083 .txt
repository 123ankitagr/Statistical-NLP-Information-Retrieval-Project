A Costa Mesa police officer who was nearly run down by man driving a four-wheel-drive pickup truck late Saturday afternoon on the Costa Mesa Freeway later caught and arrested a suspect . Motorcycle Officer Marty Carver was off his bike near the shoulder of the freeway 's southbound lanes about 5 p.m. when he saw a rust-colored , late-model Toyota truck barreling down the shoulder . Carver was trying to waive over the truck for the moving violation of driving on the shoulder when the vehicle aimed directly at him , according to police spokesman Allen Kent . The truck missed Carver by a few feet , then sped off down the freeway . Carver , unhurt , got on his motorcycle and chased the truck . Robert Paul Bishop , 34 , of Costa Mesa was arrested less than a mile farther down the freeway , where he was caught in the late-afternoon traffic . Bishop , who did not resist arrest , was held on suspicion of assault against an officer with a deadly weapon .
