MCI 's Credit Rating Lowered : Standard & Poor 's Corp. , a major credit-rating agency , downgraded its rating on some of MCI Communication Corp. 's debt . S & P said it lowered by one notch its ratings on MCI 's senior unsecured debt and subordinated debt due to MCI 's acquisition of Telecom USA Inc. , another long-distance phone company . `` The acquisition , which will likely be financed with borrowings of up to $ 1.5 billion , should initially result in a sharp deterioration in the capital structure ( of MCI ) and correspondingly higher fixed charges , '' S & P said . Kathleen Keegan , a spokeswoman for MCI , said the company was disappointed by the rating change .
