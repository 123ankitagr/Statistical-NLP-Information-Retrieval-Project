the world tungsten market severely depressed since 1989 has picked up smartly this year and experts are already worrying about a future shortage of the metal in the face of surging demand government and industry representatives who met for two days earlier this week in geneva said they expected strong growth in tungsten demand this year and next allied to world economic recovery with many tungsten mines now closed especially in industrialised countries the extra demand is being met from stocks but once stocks dry up the market may face serious instability in event of a sharp recovery in world tungsten consumption according to the united nations conference on trade and development which sponsored the meeting the price of ammonium paratungstate a key intermediate product has doubled since the beginning of 1994 to around dollars 9395 per mtu 10kg in europe this unctad says has led the industry to consider reopening conversion facilities however prices of tungsten concentrates remain too low to reverse mine closures world mine production of tungsten slumped from a peak of 60426 tonnes metal content in 1989 to 30286 tonnes in 1993 the lowest level since the 1960s that compared with consumption of ores and concentrates of 32967 tonnes last year mines in industrialised countries are producing only a tenth of their output at the beginning of the 1980s and in developing countries only about a fifth even in china the worlds biggest producer mine production has more than halved since the late 1980s to less than 20000 tonnes in 1993 unctad says the recent imposition by the us and the european union of antidumping duties on imports of chinese concentrates gives an opening to russia though it too has suffered from disrupted production in the much longer term the outlook for tungsten is mixed according to mr peter johnson of the us metal powder industries federation he told the meeting that while industrial developments offered potentially important market opportunities notably in electronics medical equipment armaments and cutting tools some traditional uses were likely to decline cermets and ceramics were increasingly used in place of tungsten carbide and the longer life of cutting tools was reducing replacement demand the us industry would also have to face up to the impact of lower spending on defence equipment and intense foreign competition in aircraft applications mr johnson said
