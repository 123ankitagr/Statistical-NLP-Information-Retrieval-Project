the august meeting of the sum seekers investment club of torrance found members scratching their heads over what to do with their 100 shares in marion laboratories the pharmaceutical company had agreed to merge with a division of dow chemical co in a mind-bending deal that would in part distribute a type of security a contingent value right to marion shareholders shareholders would be able to sell the right on the market begining in december or wait up to three years and sell it to dow would the sum seekers tell their brokers to sell marion on the open market for cold cash or tender to dow and wait for a future payoff we just decided not to deal with it and so we sold our stock said roslyn bodanis a club member it was too complex a deal the wave of corporate restructuring that swept through the business world during the 1980 s has left behind many a confused investor the 1990 s might see the pace of takeovers and restructuring slow some financial observers argue but that will still leave investors with difficult decisions to make as complex deals continue the advice to stockholders either follow the sum seekers lead and sell your shares for cash or tender your shares and proceed with great caution matters have been complicated by exotic offers loaded with mysterious securities whose value sometimes eludes even wall street veterans investors must decide whether to trade familiar common stock for packages that often include stub stocks junk bonds rights and securities that multiply into more securities you don't know what is going on and it's very confusing for the average guy to stay on top of and make the best choice said hugo quackenbush senior vice president at charles schwab corp a discount brokerage house which publishes a pamphlet to help clients on corporate restructuring investors have to sit down and figure out what is their best option that's not always easy take this summer's merger between time inc and warner communications under the deal warner stock holders will get 70 in cash for each share and three types of securities preferred stock yielding 8.75 in cash another preferred stock yielding 11 in the form of more stock for three years and then cash and shares in a spin-off company bhc communications that includes several broadcast television stations both preferred stocks would later be convertible to time common stock at certain prices time warner which will pile up 12 billion of debt to finance the deal said the three securities should be worth 70 excluding the cash payout but no one is really sure i don't think people would wait around for the three pieces of paper because of the uncertainty said industry analyst jeffrey logsdon at the los angeles investment firm of crowell weedon co as the warner deal shows a corporation is likely to be left with a lot of debt on its books after a restructuring people don't like debt said ernest wiggins manager of the fidelity value fund so you are better off getting out right away if investors do not want to abandon a stock wiggins suggests that they may want to sell only half of their holdings to lock in some profits professionals also suggest that investors who can stomach the risk familiarize themselves with a company's industry and keep up and analyze the flurry of proxy statements and news reports all that work might lead to some sweet rewards supermarket giant kroger co for example last year fought off unwanted suitors by assuming 5.3 billion in debt to finance a restructuring shareholders ended up with a one-time 40 cash dividend for each share a junk bond and kroger stock valued at about 8.50 a share that does not pay quarterly dividends kroger stock dubbed stub stock because it represents the shrunken amount of equity remaining in the company has nearly doubled in value and has traded as high as 19.75 a share but highly leveraged stub stocks have proved volatile they tend to outperform the market during bullish times but suffer more during market declines even the average person does not want a company with a lot of debt going into a recession said wiggins so they sell many marion investors wish that they had sold their shares for cash instead of accepting dow's offer which marion shareholders finally approved friday members of the pacific coast investment club unlike their brethren in the sum seekers chose to sell their 100 marion laboratories shares to dow chemical and have regretted the decision our observation said pacific coast president george baker is take your money and run for starters dow would pay cash 38 a share for only 41 of the 100 marion shares and issued rights for the remaining stock dow says it will buy those rights for up to 15.77 each in september 1991, or wait another year and pay up to 20.20 the amount would depend on the price of stock in a company formed by the merger of dow's pharmaceutical division and marion the people at marion can sympathize with their stockholder's confusion it's one of the most difficult and screwy of deals says larry wheeler investor relations director at marion i've been explaining this for six months and it still confuses me merger road map
