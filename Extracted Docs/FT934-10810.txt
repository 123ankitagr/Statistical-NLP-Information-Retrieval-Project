as reflected in trade statistics dubais economy has rarely been so buoyant the timing could not be better to implement through the recentlycreated economic department a strategy to take the emirate into the era still a long way off when a selfsustaining economic base will mean dubai is no longer dependent on oil revenues if government aspirations are met the selfsustaining economic base will rest on three factors traditional trade the leisure and business tourist industry and the continuing growth in the number of companies choosing dubai as a regional services and light industries centre but four essentials must be met if these ambitions are to be realised first there has to be regional political stability secondly there must exist a coherent and effective legal framework within which all kinds of business can flourish thirdly dubai must have abundant energy supplies at affordable rates and lastly it must rest comfortably within the federation even if it retains degrees of autonomy on different issues for the past five years dubais nonoil trade the traditional core of its economy has been growing at an annual rate of more than 20 per cent official statistics show dubai caters for 70 per cent of the uaes total trade just over half is with asian countries almost 30 per cent with europe for 1992 alone imports totalled almost dh60bn and reexports almost dh9bn the main entry and reexport points are port rashid a large and extremely efficient container port with an average reexport turnaround time of 24 hours jebel ali the largest manmade container harbour in the world the dhow traffic on dubais creek the waterway on which it built its reputation as an entrepot and the aircargo terminal which has a capacity at present of 250000 tonnes a year greatly expanded over the years and always being improved they allow dubais lifeblood to flow the funds generated by this trade are several times greater dh70bn compared with some dh10bn than revenue from crude oil and gas the funds for all this activity are entirely generated in the market says mr bill duff chief financial expert at dubais central accounts office they are not subsidised by the government whose oil revenues have to be concentrated on improving the infrastructure to cope with the increase in load dubais reexports are greatly helped by periodic problems in iran such as the imposition of quotas which limit imports these may make it more difficult for other traders but dubai is near enough and with sufficient experience to give its iranian community the necessary flexibility to take advantage of them the iranians themselves realise dubais special role for when they stipulated that all imports to tehran and bandar abbas should go direct rather than through middle men dubai was exempted but all this trade as mr duff points out is in cash investments which you have to try to stabilise so to a very large extent is tourism and the investments made by foreign companies which choose dubai as the preferred centre from which to service the wider middle east and west asia the indian subcontinent continuing political stability in the region of the kind that has existed since the end of the gulf war is therefore vital while dubai finds ways to attract more and more valuable investments the advent into dubai of so many companies particularly in the past 2 12 years has in turn unleashed a property boom in both house construction and rentals rentals some businessmen insist have risen more sharply than the actual increase in business turnover and more importantly profits these however are cyclical factors of greater concern in the longer term is that these markets houses service offices commerce could decline as rapidly as they came if the right conditions are not established within dubai to tempt more fixed investment the government needs time to expand the infrastructure and the private sector needs time to consolidate the commercial gains of the past few years both of these factors are in play partly because the prolonged recession in the west has encouraged more and more companies to venture into the expanding gulf market hence the phenomenal interest in regional exhibitions including the forthcoming air exhibition one answer to dubais and the uaes need for more fixed investment in nonoil industries is to acquire the high technology industries that come with offset programmes but as one visiting representative in dubai to discuss offset proposals said high technology industries are not like an invention you can not create one and then leave it you need the talent onthespot to run it and develop it further a source close to the government added technology transfer and diversification are all fashionable to talk about but they have to be viable before they set up here because they can not rely on government subsidies common sense and business acumen are dubais greatest assets and these are what we should build on overall strategy for dubais economic development for the next decade is with the recentlyformed dubai government economic department and mr mohamed alabbar its directorgeneral although best known to dubais business community as the man expected to streamline the process of issuing business and office licences and the principal target of their complaints when expectations are not immediately met mr alabbar has an awesome task dealing with many other issues for which he has earned the title of the governments economic troubleshooter he is credited with having turned round the governments property and other investments in singapore which it inherited from the dubai entrepreneur mr abdul wahab galadari and more recently with having rationalised the structure at dubai aluminium company which he continues to direct but the economic department under his direction also has to oversee other government onshore investments and represent dubai at meetings of federal committees where all types of draft legislation are discussed including the extent to which individual emirates retain degrees of autonomy however the core of his responsibilities lies with trying to streamline the licensing process for companies wanting to register or to renew registration his goal he says is to provide companies with their registration certificates within 48 hours of application and requests for information by fax on demand this is ambitious to say the least given the amount and complexity of forms required and the need for his staff to undergo customer service training but by and large the business community acknowledges that progress has been made mr alabbar says that a lot of the work that is done is not visible to the business community his department is involved in continuous federal committee sessions and it is in these where dubais voice is heard he is quick to point out that many of those who sit on federal committees have been at school together and that dubais relations with other emirates at federal level are fundamental to its economic future
