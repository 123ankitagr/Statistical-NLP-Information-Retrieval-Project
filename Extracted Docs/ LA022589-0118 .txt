the last missing player reported to padre spring training friday and it became official that pitcher eric show had been in bed all week with the flu the announcement was made by his face either he had the flu pitching coach pat dobson observed or hes been sleeping on a flour bag all winter a pale show six days late and nearly a waist size lighter showed up just in time to impressively complete a workout that included 12 minutes of strong pitching afterward he quickly showered dressed and begged forgiveness for hustling to the nearest bed lest someone need to carry him there im still not right he said how sick im sick enough i dont know how to measure that stuff show an eightyear veteran coming off his best season did stick around long enough to talk about the two things that could make his month here well a bit queasy 1 it appears the opening day starting assignment april 3 in san diego against san francisco is his the padre bosses who cant comment openly on this now will likely make final decision after shows fourth spring start in which he is scheduled to go five innings for a second consecutive time if at that time he is still in possession of an elbow and fingers he will be the pick this should make show uneasy but happy 2 it appears he and agent steve greenberg are having problems with his new contract worth a potential $ 36 million over three years one an option year when it was signed in midoctober the padres werent giving out threeyear guarantees then baseballs economics suddenly changed and bruce hurst and tony gwynn got them this could made show uneasy and unhappy wherever he decides to end up emotionally he is starting off with a surer step than last spring when dobson said show would finally learn to reach his potential or they would both die trying when asked if show was his biggest project last season dobson said yeah he was pretty headstrong pause but i was pretty headstrong too we battled there for a while but now i actually feel pretty close to him perhaps the relationship was forged on shows splendid 1988 finish when he won his last five starts and nine of his last 10 decisions he finished with a career high 16 victories with 11 losses including 13 complete games the most by a padre in 13 years then there was the stat that really made dobson happy show walked just 53 men in 234 23 innings only two per inning the padre staff wound up with a team record for fewest walks 439 dobson was given a nice contract and all was forgiven including the loud argument june 24 in atlanta you might remember thats where because of questionable fielding show gave up four runs in the first inning of an eventual 43 loss to the braves he not the fielders were later criticized by manager jack mckeon and dobson show heard the criticism and confronted the pair setting off a match of raised voices in the middle of the clubhouse show ended it by looking at dobson and saying im ashamed for you dobber eight months later dobson is proud of show so proud that he is pushing him for the opening day start after that game i think he really progressed and became able to face a lot of things without rattling dobson said errors didnt rattle him tiny hits didnt rattle him he showed he could cope with all the bull he became a lot more aggressive almost like im going to show you guys thats the kind of guy you want out there for you opening day it would be shows fourth opening day start all within the past six years where last season he went along with larry bowas experiment to save him for the third game and ease off the pressure this year he says he is ready pat dobson and i talked about it he asked how i felt about it and i said its fine show said i turned it down last year at bowas behest we mixed it all up and it didnt really work the padres dropped their first five games so yeah its ok with me but its still no big deal its just another game but with a lot more hoopla ed whitson who pitched his first opening day last season said it was also fine with him all it is is more publicity i dont need any more of that ill just take my starts and go on home bruce hurst whom you might think would be the opening day starter if you didnt understand mckeons and dobsons sense of loyalty also does not mind its not that big of a start when you consider some of the ones youll make later said hurst speaking from playoff and world series experience nonetheless dobson thinks opening day is an honor and show is worthy of it after the way he pitched last year hes earned it dobson said bruce hurst pitched great last year too but he did it in boston now for shows spring fever his agent greenberg said friday that the padres changed their fiscal policy within a couple of weeks of signing free agent show he said he wants shows contract to include that change essentially he wants shows third year currently at the clubs option and worth $ 14 million to be guaranteed and perhaps for more bruce hursttype money $ 16 million while the padres are at it the padres problem is that the contract already heavily weighs in shows favor if he throws 175 innings in either of the next two years the option is automatically guaranteed show has topped 200 innings in five of the past six years also the third year contains a unique arbitration clause if shows $ 14 million salary isnt market value he could take the club to arbitration we really dont expect this to be a big deal said dick freeman the padres interim president weve had general discussions with the agent and ill sit down with eric one of these days and well just chat its not as if show will walk out of camp according to greenberg but he already has been burned by signing too early and not testing a free agent market that later went haywire any further perceived burns might not be good employee relations its like if you have two kids and you tell one he has a 10 pm curfew and then a couple of weeks later when the other kid goes out you change the curfew to midnight greenberg explained shouldnt you let the first kid come home at midnight too when we signed we were told certain policy things couldnt be changed then a couple of weeks later the policy is turned on its head we just think its a logical question to ask that our contract discussions be revisited show a jazz guitarist who had a difficult enough winter producing two jazz albums under his own label said he prefers not to discuss money yet im just thankful for the opportunity to play here show said my money is not megamegamega but its still pretty good i wouldnt even think about leaving camp over it it just want to get working and get that yuma feeling again theres a song title in there somewhere by now youve probably figured that nothing eric show does not even simply showing up at training camp is less than lyrical
