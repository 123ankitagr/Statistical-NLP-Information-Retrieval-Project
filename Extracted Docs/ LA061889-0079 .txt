re the 15yearold bicyclist who got a $ 96 ticket by joanne thomas june 11 isnt it a shame that mrs thomas is outraged with the irvine police department for issuing a ticket to her son for failure to stop his bike at a stop sign what does she think a stop sign is for why does she condone his breaking of the law what message is she giving him by fighting in court when she knows he is guilty you break the law you pay and whose fault is it that she must take time off from work and valuable court time to fight this heinous crime this woman needs help in positive parenting i would never condone my childrens behavior in a similar situation b wall newport beach
