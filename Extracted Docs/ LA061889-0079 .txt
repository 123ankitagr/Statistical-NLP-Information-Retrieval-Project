Re `` The 15-Year-Old Bicyclist Who Got a $ 96 Ticket '' by Joanne Thomas ( June 11 ) : Is n't it a shame that Mrs. Thomas is `` outraged with the Irvine Police Department '' for issuing a ticket to her son for failure to stop his bike at a stop sign ? What does she think a stop sign is for ? Why does she condone his breaking of the law ? What message is she giving him by `` fighting in court '' when she knows he is guilty ? You break the law , you pay ! And whose fault is it that she must take `` time off from work and valuable court time '' to fight this heinous crime ? This woman needs help in positive parenting . I would never condone my children 's behavior in a similar situation . B . WALL Newport Beach
