is there a hint of cannibalism about eating an animal that has been genetically engineered to include human genes should a moslem or jew avoid meat from a cow that includes pig genes can vegetarians eat plants containing animal genes such questions may sound like absurd moral speculation but biotechnology is moving so fast that the worlds religious and ethical thinkers will soon have to give practical advice on genetically modified foods some preliminary advice came yesterday from the uk governments ethical committee on genetic modification of food it found no overriding ethical objections to foods incorporating copies of human genes but recommended that products containing human and other ethically sensitive genes be labelled clearly to allow consumers to make an informed choice the committee of six was chaired by john polkinghorne president of queens college cambridge who is an ordained scientist it consulted widely among different religious groups and others who feel strongly about food purity its report concludes that a human gene inserted into another species should not be regarded as human material this is partly because what is transplanted is not an original human gene but a copy of one and to make the point the committee uses throughout the report the cumbersome phrase copy genes of human origin in any case the report says the gene loses its human character outside the context of a human cell experimental transgenic animals with human genes already exist for example sheep that make factor ix the bloodclotting protein for haemophiliacs such animals are far too valuable to reach the meat market today but surplus transgenic sheep those that do not make enough human protein for pharmaceutical use may be sold for food at some point in the future report of the ethical committee on genetic modification of food hmso pounds 795
