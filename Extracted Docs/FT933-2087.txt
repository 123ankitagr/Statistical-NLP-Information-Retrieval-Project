Is there a hint of cannibalism about eating an animal that has been genetically engineered to include human genes ? Should a Moslem or Jew avoid meat from a cow that includes pig genes ? Can vegetarians eat plants containing animal genes ? Such questions may sound like absurd moral speculation . But biotechnology is moving so fast that the world 's religious and ethical thinkers will soon have to give practical advice on genetically modified foods . Some preliminary advice came yesterday from the UK government 's Ethical Committee on Genetic Modification of Food . It found 'no overriding ethical objections ' to foods incorporating copies of human genes , but recommended that products containing human and other 'ethically sensitive ' genes be labelled clearly to allow consumers to make an informed choice . The committee of six was chaired by John Polkinghorne , president of Queens' College , Cambridge , who is an ordained scientist . It consulted widely among different religious groups and others who feel strongly about food purity . Its report concludes that a human gene inserted into another species should not be regarded as human material . This is partly because what is transplanted is not an original human gene but a copy of one - and , to make the point , the committee uses throughout the report the cumbersome phrase 'copy genes of human origin ' . In any case , the report says , the gene loses its human character outside the context of a human cell . Experimental transgenic animals with human genes already exist - for example sheep that make Factor IX , the blood-clotting protein , for haemophiliacs . Such animals are far too valuable to reach the meat market today . But surplus transgenic sheep - those that do not make enough human protein for pharmaceutical use - may be sold for food at some point in the future . * Report of the Ethical Committee on Genetic Modification of Food , HMSO , Pounds 7.95 .
