A moribund Palestinian organization replaced by the Palestine Liberation Organization more than 25 years ago has resurfaced because of Arab anger with the PLO 's stand in the Persian Gulf crisis .

'' The committee 's statement , released in New York , was published in the widely read Saudi-owned newspaper Asharq al Awsat .
