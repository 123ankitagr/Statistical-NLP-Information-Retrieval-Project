The debate over genetic testing will involve profound questions about the boundaries between the rights of individuals and the rights of employers and insurers . The manner in which society answers these questions , experts say , will rival in significance earlier challenges in the civil rights and workers ' rights arenas . The parallel is apt . Some of the earliest documented cases of discriminatory genetic screening relate to sickle-cell anemia , an inherited blood disease that affects blacks almost exclusively . This potentially fatal disease results from a single gene defect that causes a deformation of oxygen-carrying red blood cells . It became the object of widespread screening in the United States in the early 1970s , partly in response to demands by the black community for better health care . Almost immediately , however , observers recognized in the programs a double-edged sword , with evidence that some employers might be using test results to discriminate against blacks . Even `` carriers '' of the disease -- those whose chromosomes contain only one of two possible genes for the disease and who generally show no ill effects -- were sometimes denied jobs as airline pilots , deferred from some branches of the armed forces and saddled with higher insurance premiums . Several states have since passed laws against the misuse of sickle-cell screening . But those early cases put minorities on notice that genetic testing has more than therapeutic possibilities . And now , with the genes for other diseases and medical predispositions coming into focus , every individual becomes , in a sense , a minority member with particular odds of suffering a particular medical fate .
