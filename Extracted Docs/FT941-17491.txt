The Mini car , the late Sir Alex Issigonis 's 'flying shoebox ' , is entering its 35th year of production with its largest market no longer Britain but Japan , where it has achieved a cult status . There are even Japanese magazines devoted to it . To help the enthusiasm along , Rover Japan , the Japanese publishing house NEKO and several other Japanese business concerns are entering one of the tiny machines - a 100 horsepower Cooper version - in January 's Monte Carlo rally . Not even Rover seriously suggests that the Japanese Mini - or three others being entered from the UK - will mount a credible challenge to the 300 horsepower monsters of the modern rallying world . The winner is far more likely to be a Toyota .
