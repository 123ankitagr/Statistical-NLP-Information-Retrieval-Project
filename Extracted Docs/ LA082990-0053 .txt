In a manner of speaking , Clemson is out on bail , which is to say , it is allowed by the NCAA to continue football operations , but is under surveillance . It has a new coach , Ken Hatfield , shifting from Arkansas to replace Danny Ford , who was n't exactly fired . He was paid off and asked to vanish . He departed a team , however gathered , that posted a record of 10-2 , including a 27-7 victory over West Virginia in the Gator Bowl . The team would be ranked one of the best on defense in the land . And six of these defenders , named All-ACC , are back . What we have here is a sort of lunatic index to a game against Clemson undertaken Saturday by Cal State Long Beach , George Herbert Allen , coach . George did n't book this game . It merely became his responsibility when , at 72 , he accepted the coaching post at Long Beach , from where units have sailed to the Persian Gulf . George wishes he were with them . `` Are you aware that Clemson is a 37 1/2-point favorite ? '' he is asked . `` Someone told me Clemson was favored by 58 , '' he answered . `` We may have a shot . '' What can be said in behalf of your team ? '' he is asked . `` Well , we are playing at Clemson , where the home team will have 80,000 rooters . There will be heavy humidity we are not used to . Clemson 's lines outweigh us an average of 24 pounds . And Clemson has a new coach eager to get off to a good start and land in the polls ' top 10 . '' `` And that only adds up to 37 1/2 points ? '' `` The Clemson coach , '' George continues , `` looked at his team in practice and told the press that no one from his Arkansas team , which went to the Cotton Bowl last season , could land a starting job on this club . '' George pondered this a moment . `` But do n't say anything that is going to discourage my players . Just run the headline , 'Allen Fears Clemson . ' `` Back to his old modus operandi , George is flying in his team two days ahead of the game , as he usually did with the Rams and Washington Redskins . `` We 'll arrive Thursday night and have a meeting , '' he says . `` We will then have a meeting Friday morning , work out and have a nap before dinner . '' On the road with the Rams , George put his players down for a nap on Saturday afternoon , promising each an extra $ 10 for dinner if the performer was in his room when George checked . Dick Bass inquired : `` Coach , if I take a nap with a girl , do I get $ 20 ? '' It developed that the league would nail George for offering illegal incentives , and his $ 10 rewards for napping were abolished , which was just as well . `` If we 're napping , '' a player told him , `` and you call to check , you wake us up from the nap , anyway . '' `` Are you able to hurl some experience at Clemson ? '' Allen is asked . `` Our starting defensive line has yet to play a down in college , '' he replies . `` Our guys are all from junior college and high school . '' `` And your quarterback ? '' `` He has yet to play a college game , too . '' It is n't surprising that on Saturday morning before the Clemson game , George should arrange prayer services for his club . In the NFL , he always arranged such services on Sunday morning . George is n't especially religious , nor is he sure God concerns himself with football . But in case he does , George wants him on his side . `` Do you feel the opposing coach will try to run up big numbers on you ? '' `` I hope he does n't have the chance , '' he answers . `` We have put in a lot of hard work to stop this team . I have n't been going home . I have been sleeping at a hotel near our practice field . '' Reflecting on George 's debut against Clemson , you recall the reporter doing an interview at 5 in the morning with a man about to be executed . `` What is your feeling ? '' the reporter asked . The guy answered : `` It 's a hell of a way to start the day . ''
