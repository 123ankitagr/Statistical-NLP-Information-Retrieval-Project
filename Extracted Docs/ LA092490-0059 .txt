the exchange was brief more professional than cordial but it surprised keith jackson nonetheless jackson was walking off the field after the philadelphia eagles 2721 victory over the rams sunday at anaheim stadium when he was stopped by eagles owner norman braman good game keith good game braman said thanks jackson answered braman and jackson hadnt exchanged too many words since wednesday when jackson ended a 50day holdout over his contract with only two days of practice jackson started sunday and caught four passes for 77 yards but jacksons return wasnt exactly smooth he was upset the eagles didnt renegotiate his fouryear $ 21million contract but he came back anyway he said braman was holding off negotiations with him so the eagles who lost their first two games would keep losing jackson said braman was using the slow start as an excuse to fire coach buddy ryan braman denied both charges so did braman and jackson settle their differences sunday im trying not to think about it jackson said we have to get the controversy out of the locker room if we want to win all thats behind me now while jackson didnt get a warm welcome in the front office eagles coaches and players were glad to have the thirdyear pro back especially ryan keith jacksons presence opened up a lot of things ryan said you know hes the best tight end in football we gave him the game ball for his leadership and enthusiasm his presence brought relief to wide receiver mike quick who had been doubleteamed in philadelphias first two games losses to the new york giants 2720 and phoenix cardinals 2321 quick had three catches for 37 yards and a touchdown sunday before leaving in the fourth quarter with a sore quadriceps in his left leg he had only four catches for 81 yards and no touchdowns in his previous two games keith is just another spoke in the wheel quick said with him back we had a lot of soft spots in the coverage downfield it was nice to have someone back who could work in the middle of the field jacksons presence also gave randall cunningham the eagles scrambling quarterback an extra target they the rams really couldnt key on anybody cunningham said when they would key on the wideouts we went to keith when they keyed on keith we went to the wideouts simple but effective jackson caught passes of 20 13 16 and 28 yards three of his receptions came over the middle when cunningham was scrambling away from ram defenders randall did a good job of picking up the mantoman coverages jackson said he kept looking at me on the scramble thats how cunningham found jackson over the middle for a 20yard gain on the second play of the game i was standing out there yelling hit me hit me jackson said i wanted to get that first lick out of the way randall and i have always had a knack for this its like with doug williams and jimmy giles they have that knack too once cunningham looks deep and doesnt find anyone he knows he can look over the middle for me but for the last two weeks jackson wasnt there had he not ended his holdout jackson a former allamerican at oklahoma would have been in norman okla watching the eagles on tv when told he probably wouldnt get the ram telecast in oklahoma jackson said i would just watch it on my satellite dish hey we have money in oklahoma hell be spending some of that money this week harry gamble eagles president told jackson he would have to pay fines totaling $ 114500 for his holdout he has to pay $ 68000 for the two games he missed and $ 1500 per day for the 31 days he missed of training camp but for jackson its money well spent im just glad to be back he said i think i did pretty good former oklahoma coach barry switzer always said i had some kind of magic about me i was glad i brought some of the magic back today
