response decrease rbcs epc acts red flag alerts bone marrow produce rbcs this multicenter study showed administering genetically manufactured epo intravenously allowed 96 patients treated store enough blood without becoming anemic the side at moment treatment costs high $ 2500 patient procedure still investigational insurance companies yet established policy reimbursement other ongoing studies examining effects lowerdose therapy bring costs when autologous donations option emergency operations openheart surgery involve massive blood loss another option utilizing blood technique known
