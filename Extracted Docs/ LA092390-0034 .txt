A judge Friday sentenced religious cult leader Jeffrey Don Lundgren to death for killing a five-member family belonging to his cult . Common Pleas Judge Martin Parks , in issuing the sentence , followed the recommendation of a Lake County jury . The other option was life in prison . Defense lawyer Charles Grieshammer pleaded Thursday for the judge to spare Lundgren 's life , saying the Independence , Mo. , native believed he was following God 's will when he shot the Dennis Avery family , which included children ages 15 , 13 and 6 , to death . Lundgren , 40 , a one-time lay minister in the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints , was convicted on Aug. 29 of aggravated murder for the 1989 killings . The murders were committed in April , 1989 , but the bodies were not uncovered until early January this year , after a member of Lundgren 's former cult went to authorities in Kansas City . The cult had broken up in December . Also facing a possible death sentence is Jeffrey Lundgren 's 19-year-old son , Damon Lundgren . He was convicted of four counts of aggravated murder last week .
