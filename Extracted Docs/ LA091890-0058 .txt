likening him to charles manson as a master manipulator a judge on monday ordered computer whiz david brown to spend the rest of his life in prison without parole for orchestrating his wifes 1985 murder mr brown youre a scary person orange county superior court judge donald a mccartin told the 37yearold defendant who was convicted of murder in june for setting up his devoted 14yearold daughter to murder his fifth wife while she slept while his daughter sat silently in prison for nearly four years the anaheim hills man collected $ 835000 from the victims insurance policy and lived in opulence with his new wife the victims teenage sister whom he recruited to aid in the murder and then secretly wed in imposing the heaviest sentence open to him mccartin said that if the district attorneys office had pursued the death penalty against brown the judge might well have sent him to the gas chamber for his unbelievable crimes browns best hope for a more lenient sentence was to have mccartin strike down the jurys finding that he killed his wife for financial gain thus opening up the possibility of parole but mccartin said there was ample evidence to suggest that the insurance money was certainly a comotive in the crime and warranted life in prison in my view mccartin said in an interview he got a break when the da dropped the death penalty it would have been a tough call for the judge to make when youre dealing with someone whos never been in trouble with the law before but this case is the most bizarre ive ever heard its hard to believe that someone could have that much control over other people the judge added he called brown a master manipulator and told him during sentencing that his ability to betray those close to him and not bat an eye was amazing it makes charles manson look like a piker said mccartin
