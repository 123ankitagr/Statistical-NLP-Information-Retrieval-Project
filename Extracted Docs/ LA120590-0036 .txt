Saying that Christmas has become nothing more than garbage-giving , several environmental groups this week issued `` Wastemaker '' awards to nine manufacturers for over-packaging their products . Among the items cited as contributing to the nation 's garbage crisis were Calvin Klein `` Obsession '' gift sets , Nintendo Trophy Figure with Scorecard and Matchbox Super Color Changers . `` Of the 180 million tons of garbage generated every year , one-third of that is packaging , '' said Julie Duncan , spokeswoman for the California Public Interest Research Group . A coalition of environmental organizations issued the quarterly awards in Los Angeles , San Diego , Washington and a dozen other cities . The other six products named were Sears Christmas ornaments , Saranac football gloves , Smooshees Smugglers , `` Holiday Enchantment '' cassette tape set , Drakkar Noir cosmetics gift set and Carlton Cards wrap and trim ensemble .
