Ms Nancy O'Mara Ezold , a US lawyer who successfully sued her former employers on the grounds that she had been passed over for partnership because of her sex , has lost her case on appeal . The 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the 1990 decision of US district judge James McGirr Kelly against Ms Ezold 's former employers , Wolf Block Schorr and Solis-Cohen , the Philadelphia law firm . Judge Kelly had 'impermissibly substituted his own subjective judgment for that of Wolf in determining that Ezold met the firm 's partnership standards ' , the court said . The case was the first of its kind to go to trial involving a law firm . Ms Ezold was following Ms Ann Hopkins who in 1989 had successfully sued accountants Price Waterhouse because she was passed over for partnership after she was evaluated by male partners as too 'macho ' . An interesting feature of the Ezold case was that instead of seeking damages she wanted Wolf to be forced to take her back as a partner . Ms Ezold's attorney says she will appeal .
