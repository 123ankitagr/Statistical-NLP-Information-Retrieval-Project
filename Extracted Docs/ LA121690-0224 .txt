business a lot depends on appearances how you look and act donald trump has created a character of himself that is bigger than life perhaps the most unusual reason for taking an acting class is offered by kirk who said she has both tourettes syndrome and obsessivecompulsive disorder the syndrome is a rare neurological disease with a variety of symptoms including involuntary purposeless movements swearing tics and incoherent grunts and barks kirk said her case is mild with physical tics and a tendency to clear her throat and she said she is obsessive or compulsive about touching

particularly helpful for people with disabilities and their participation in the course is of value to the other students weve got disabled people deaf people a student with a spinal injury who has taught us a lot about how to focus because its so difficult for him to move varela said the student with the spinal injury recently did a scene in which he played a farmer being pressured by a salesman to sell his land the scene required him to take oranges out of a box the way he was doing it was so compelling varela said he did it much more slowly and with tremendous commitment to each gesture at the same time the class is helping the student in his determined fight to gain independence varela said lewis believes that theatrical training is valuable no matter what field a student is pursuing i think there are many professional areas that require people to be persuasive speakers she said i feel that acting should be a requirement like speech is theres getting up in front of people with their cards and boring people or getting up before people and appealing to them emotionally she added people are not just moved by reason theyre moved by emotion mckinley has found that to be
