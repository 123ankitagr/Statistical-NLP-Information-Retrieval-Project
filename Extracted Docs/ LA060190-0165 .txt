Communist North Korea , which counts the Soviet Union among its few allies , today warned Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the `` serious political consequences '' if he goes ahead and meets Monday with South Korean President Roh Tae Woo in San Francisco . The meeting between Gorbachev and Roh , arranged by the United States to follow Gorbachev 's summit talks with President Bush , was seen as a major political setback for North Korea . A North Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman said North Korea still hopes the meeting will not occur .
