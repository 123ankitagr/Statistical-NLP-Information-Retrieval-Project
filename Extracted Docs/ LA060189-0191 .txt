Resort Living on the Links With a name like Big Canyon you would expect to see some sort of narrow chasm with precipitous walls and water flowing through the middle , right ? Welllll , not exactly . The heart of the Big Canyon neighborhood is a sprawling 390-acre , lush residential complex and country club . Bounded by four major arterial streets -- Ford and San Joaquin Hills roads on the north and south and MacArthur Boulevard and Jamboree Road on the east and west -- this `` fortress '' of foliage and fairways lies immediately north of the Newport Center Financial Plaza , one of Orange County 's principal commercial and financial centers . The major open space and recreational amenity is the Big Canyon golf course . Lakes , creeks and ponds run throughout the 145-acre layout . With the Big Canyon Country Club acting as the focal point of the complex , the Irvine Co. created a serene , resort-like homestead . The club opened in April , 1972 , and 2 years later its 500 stockholders bought the entire operation from the Irvine Co. Today , there are 400 non-equity members besides the 500 stockholders who operate the club . Professional golfer Shirley Little is an honorary member . She does most of her practicing on the blue-green grassy turf of the club . Built around and throughout the golf course are 500 homes -- 225 of them townhouses perched on the outer perimeter . Single-family homes are situated nearer the middle . As befits an ambiance dominated by a country club , many of the neighborhood 's streets are named for famous links -- Burning Tree Circle , Winged Foot Lane , Augusta Road , Cypress Point and Inverness and Oakmont lanes , just to name a few . Home prices reflect what has happened elsewhere in the county . When units went on sale in Big Canyon in 1972 , houses started at $ 75,000 , condominiums around $ 65,000 . Today , prices for the average four- or five-bedroom home with three-car garage begin around $ 800,000 , or $ 500,000 for a townhouse . Danny Bibb , a Grubb & Ellis real estate agent who has been a resident since 1980 and has sold 100 houses in the neighborhood , describes his customers this way : `` Three-fourth of the buyers have families and most are in the 35- to 55-age group . The majority of homeowners never leave the immediate area -- they might buy another home smaller or larger , but they usually do n't leave . '' They are also among Orange County 's most affluent residents . Big Canyon is the third-richest neighborhood in the county , with a median household income exceeding $ 100,000 per year . Big Canyon can also accommodate those who prefer to rent . At the intersection of Ford Road and MacArthur Boulevard are the Big Canyon Villas , not to be confused with the gate-guarded estates a block away . Seventy- eight townhouses are for rent only and range from $ 2,175 to $ 3,250 monthly . Most residents in Newport Beach seem to put great emphasis on the harbor area , but not Big Canyon residents . They opt for grass , shrubs , trees , flowers and , of course , golf .
