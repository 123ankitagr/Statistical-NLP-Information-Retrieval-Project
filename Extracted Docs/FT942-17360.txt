for a number of years policymakers have recognised that commodity prices may play a potentially useful role in predicting inflation trends there was even a period in the late 1980s when the seven major industrialised countries formally adopted a commodity price basket to help guide monetary policy recent remarks by mr alan greenspan the fed chairman that gold prices are a valuable indicator of inflationary expectations suggest that at least in the us commodity prices may once again be influencing monetary policy decisions the idea that commodity prices may play a causal role in the inflation process is not new many economists have emphasised the role of commodity prices especially oil prices in the inflationary booms of 197375 and 197981 and the subsequent disinflation of the 1980s at the moment global financial markets have a heightened sensitivity to inflation any pickup in commodity prices could easily spark fears of tightening in monetary policy by the fed and limit the scope for easing in other countries the financial markets nervousness in part reflects the rise in a range of commodity price indicators over the past year yet the links between commodity prices and inflation are complex and the inflationary implications of the recent increases is far from clear a commodity price indicator is intuitively attractive for a number of reasons first generalised rises in commodity prices can represent early signs of inflationary pressure most obviously a rise in food and oil prices will have an immediate impact on consumer prices more generally increases in the price of raw materials will raise industrial production costs which may then be passed on to the consumer in the form of higher finished goods prices second commodity prices are sensitive to monetary policy changes a relaxation of monetary policy may lead ultimately to higher inflation as the additional demand generated in the economy boosts the prices of commodities and manufactured goods but because commodities tend to be traded in highly competitive markets their prices generally adjust more rapidly than either wages or the prices of finished goods commodity prices may therefore serve as an early lead indicator of future movements in consumer price inflation third commodity prices may act as a catalyst to the inflation process jumps in commodity prices are generally temporary and often reverse themselves within two or three years yet shocks to consumer price inflation often show a high degree of persistence to sustain the inflation process other forces within the economy must therefore act to reinforce a commodity price shock for instance a rise in consumer price inflation resulting from a commodity price shock may create upward pressure on wages as workers seek to maintain their real standard of living this then feeds back into domestic prices which creates the potential for yet another upward move in wages and so on thus an initial shock from commodity prices could have a lasting effect on inflation the extent to which commodity prices show up in consumer price inflation depends on the source of the shock to the economic system and the policy stance of central banks if an increase in commodity price inflation is met with tighter monetary policy this would have the effect of slowing the rate of increase of other prices in the economy this would alter the relative price between commodities and other goods while leaving the overall rate of inflation unchanged a commodity price shock should only prove inflationary if it is accommodated by central banks clearly the link between commodity prices and inflation is far from automatic for one thing commodity prices are very much more volatile than consumer prices this alone calls into question their reliability as inflation indicators nevertheless there is a similarity betweens cycles in commodity price inflation and consumer price inflation in the main industrialised countries as the graph shows there is also a tendency for peaks and troughs in commodity price inflation to precede those in consumer price inflation yet while the linkages between commodity prices and consumer prices are important they do not seem stable enough to be able to draw strong conclusions about the extent to which consumer prices will respond to any change in commodity prices often large commodity price increases can occur because of temporary supply disruptions yet in most cases these would be unlikely to have general inflationary implications for this reason it is better to look at the behaviour of baskets of commodities rather than to concentrate on individual price movements if the price of several commodities are rising strongly this is more likely to be in response to global demand conditions than to unusual supply conditions in any individual market even so the signals from different commodity price indices can be quite different depending on the commodities included and the weights attached to each one the economist index for example shows that commodity prices are up by 12 per cent in dollar terms over the past year yet this index excludes oil prices which are down by 30 per cent over the same period the crb index which includes crude oil but with the same weight as orange juice and the other 19 components is up by 9 per cent by contrast the goldman sachs commodity index which includes 19 commodities that are assigned weights reflecting their importance in world production and consumption shows a rise of 3 per cent since the beginning of 1994 although this still leaves the level of commodity prices 8 per cent lower than a year ago so should financial markets be worried about the recent upturn in commodity prices almost certainly not although the us and uk economies appear to be growing strongly the same can not be said for japan and the rest of europe the amount of slack in the world economy is still large as shown by high levels of unemployment in this environment it is hard to see how a rise in commodity prices could act as a catalyst for a sustained rise in consumer price inflation for this to occur labour markets will need to tighten considerably first commodity prices may have turned but this carries few worries for inflation at the current time david walton is senior international economist at goldman sachs
