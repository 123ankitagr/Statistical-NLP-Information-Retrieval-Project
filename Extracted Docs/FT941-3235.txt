Mercury 's business customers may be paying more for their telephone calls than if they used British Telecommunications , because of a long delay by Mercury in matching recent BT price cuts , Andrew Adonis writes . Earlier this month BT abolished its peak-rate for calls made between 9am and 1pm on weekdays . Mercury has failed to abolish its peak rate for customers with direct Mercury connections - which includes most City businesses - and will not do so until March 31 . Mercury abolished its peak rate for customers with indirect Mercury connections on the same day as BT but not for directly connected customers . Mercury 's standard tariffs for direct customers are now higher than BT 's for calls made between 9am and 1pm . Mr Graham Mariner , chairman of the Telecommunications Managers ' Association , which represents large users , said he had not been aware of Mercury 's delay . 'Most companies would probably have missed this , and some may be paying over the odds , ' he said . Mercury said the delay was caused by the need to file tariff changes for directly connected customers with Oftel , the industry regulator , 28 days in advance . BT filed its abolition of the peak rate on February 7 . Mercury filed its matching price cut on March 3 . 'It was about as speedy as we could go , ' Mercury said .
