michael jacksons sudden break with his longtime attorney and adviser john branca has all the intrigue and suspense of a genuine pop thriller the question everybodys asking why has pops biggest star severed ties with branca the top rock attorney who guided jacksons career for more than a decade industry insiders offered a variety of conflicting plot twists after the news broke last week but there was one common thread the name of david geffen an industry power broker and longtime jackson innercircle adviser speculation over geffens alleged role in the drama ranged from a power struggle between the chairman of geffen records and branca to a longrange plan to possibly lure jackson away from cbs records branca and the always pressshy jackson refused to comment and geffen insisted he was not responsible for brancas departure i had absolutely nothing to do with it said geffen who recently sold his company to mca in exchange for about $ 540 million worth of mca stock geffen continued i just think michael decided it was time to make a change its no reflection on john i think hes a superb attorney however geffen acknowledged that brancas law partner kenneth ziffren has severed his ties with geffen and his company in the wake of brancas departure kenny is an old friend who remains a good friend said geffen who is also one of four members of a committee that regularly advises jackson on financial investments but i think kenny feels i should have warned him about what was going on i just didnt feel i had the right to share whatever i might know about michaels business with him or anybody the break comes at a critical juncture in jacksons career and a short time after being released from st johns chk hospital where he spent several days undergoing tests after complaining of chest pains numerous key industry figures none of whom wanted to be identified confirmed that jackson who has been without a formal manager for more than a year has been negotiating a contract with the labased management firm steifelphillips which has had success in recent years handling the careers of rod stewart suzanna hoffs and prince the split with branca has apparently put this deal on hold jackson is also scheduled to deliver his muchdelayed new album to cbs records by aug 1 the package which has been shrouded in secrecy was initially billed as a greatesthits collection with perhaps four new songs but the album may now consist of allnew material more importantly jackson has been in the process of renegotiating his multimilliondollar contract with cbs and has made it clear that cbs will not receive the album until his deal is done while some observers blamed the ousting of branca on jacksons unpredictable temperament several suggested the departure was prompted by tensions surrounding the cbs negotiations the veteran attorney handles a host of big names including the rolling stones poison david lee roth and several key corporate clients and has been credited with helping establish jackson as one of pops wealthiest stars thanks in large part to his extensive music publishing holdings which include a beatles catalogue now valued at more than $ 125 million one of brancas strengths his good working relationship with cbs records could have led to his downfall some speculate rightly or wrongly michael was apparently unhappy or at least concerned with the way branca was handling the renegotiation said one top level exec he seemed to feel he needed someone who wasnt so closely associated with cbs as branca suggested another insider its possible branca brought some of this on by building a lot of his practice on michaels shoulders but like many pop stars michael is very insecure and was apparently jealous of any time branca spent with other clients michael could be worried about whether hell ever be able to repeat the huge success he had in the mid80s maybe he has expectations that no one can possibly fulfill several insiders speculated that if negotiations with cbs were to go badly jackson might choose to leave cbs and sign with geffen or another label using a complicated legal loophole involving a sevenyear limitation on binding contracts geffen insists he has no intention of signing jackson and sources close to jackson say the pop star has no interest in leaving cbs unless negotiations reach an impasse as it stands jackson is scheduled to interview possible new legal advisers it is expected that instead of hiring one attorney he will spread his affairs among several lawyers with one for music publishing one for his cbs negotiations and one or more for films and litigation among the leading contenders are lee phillips for publishing bert fields for litigation and alan grubman for recordlabel matters
