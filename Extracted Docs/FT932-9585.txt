facsimile machines that spew out piles of paper which are often misplaced or misdirected with electronic mail the message appears directly upon the computer screen on the desk of the individual being contacted the biggest roadblock to the success of electronic mail in the past has been the lack of a critical mass of users although dozens of personal computer electronic mail services are available until recently they were not linked this meant that to reach somebody it was necessary to subscribe to the same electronic messaging system over the past couple of years however many electronic mail systems have started talking to one another the mechanism for this is internet a lowcost and efficient link between electronic mail services worldwide the internet links an estimated 15m computers over 10000 networks in 50 countries serving about 6m users internet enthusiast brendan p kehoe whose popular guide to using the internet zen and the art of the internet prenticehall is a mustread for all new users describes the internet as a large network of networks he points out that there is no single network regional networks like suranet prepnet and nearnet are all interconnected or internetworked together he says and all this activity takes place in realtime the internet resembles a computer network cooperative there is no central authority that oversees it and rules are largely informal its roots lie in a us defence department project begun in the early 1970s to enable us universities national laboratories and government agencies to share information over the past 20 years it has mushroomed to include regional corporate and public networks including commercial electronic mail systems people conduct their love life over the internet their hobbies and their interests they argue politics and engage in all kinds of business says mitch kapor cofounder of the electronic frontier foundation in cambridge massachusetts which promotes awareness of the online world internet is doubling annually in users networks computers and traffic says vinton cerf president of the internet society a volunteer secretariat that helps administer the network it is growing faster than any other telecommunications systems ever built including the telephone network commercial users now outnumber academic and government internet users and by 1998 cerf predicts the system will serve over 100m users despite the anarchic nature of its structure the basics of using internet communications are simple all that is needed is a computer modem a communications software package and a subscription to an online information service linked to the internet public access to the internet is provided by popular services such as compuserve mci mail and applelink subscription costs range from about dollars 9 pounds 580 to dollars 20 per month depending upon the service and varying according to the information services offered once a subscription to one of these services is obtained the charge for sending an electronic messages is generally only a few pennies depending upon the message length and the time it takes to transmit in most places a local telephone call will connect you to the system a subscription to compuserve one of the most widely used online information services costs dollars 895 per month compuserve users simply dial a local access number with the modem log on and type go mail to enter the message system the charge for reading or sending internet messages is 15 cents for the first 75kbytes about 900 words and 5 cents per additional 25kbytes about 300 words after that the key to sending an internet message lies in the internet address a typical internet address might be jsmithcix compulink co uk the elements of the address are not particularly cryptic the name of the recipient is j smith and he is a subscriber at or cix the full name of which is compulink the last two designations show that compulink is a company rather than an educational establishment or government agency that resides in the uk one drawback is that it is not always easy to find internet addresses although some systems offer international directories of their electronic mail users there is no central directory critics say the internet originally designed for use in scientific and education applications does not have security and easeofuse features that commercial users want at peak business hours promptness of service on the internet can also be a problem despite its limitations the internet is an inexpensive way of sending and receiving electronic messages doing business without access to such electronic mail systems is soon likely to be as rare as the office without a telephone
