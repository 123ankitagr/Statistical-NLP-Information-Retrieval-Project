The cut in base rates this week further narrowed the gap between short and long term interest rates ( the yield on long-dated gilts ) . For a long time , it was standard for short term rates to be below long term - in the jargon , a positive yield curve - but in recent times a negative yield curve has been the norm . Forcing short term rates any lower will probably require a similar move in Germany .
