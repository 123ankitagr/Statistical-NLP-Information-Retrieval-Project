a popular myth peddled by socalled postkeynesian economists argues that the tradeoff between unemployment and inflation if it ever existed has disappeared but for monetary policymakers this tradeoff is very much alive too great an easing of monetary policy by the us federal reserve may yet turn a sluggish recovery into rapid growth and accelerating inflation the bank of japan has faced the opposite risk too little too late may have already transformed a gentle slowdown into a westernstyle deflation the job of these monetary policymakers is tricky because of the very long and unpredictable lags between changes in interest rates and their effect on economic activity but policy is doubly difficult to judge at present because of the erratic behaviour of the central bankers favoured leading indicators of future inflation the growth of broad monetary aggregates in the us the narrow monetary aggregate labelled m1 mainly notes coins and noninterest bearing current accounts has accelerated rapidly over the past six months yet broad money m2 which also includes a variety of interestbearing time deposits is still growing very slowly and is barely above the lower limit of the feds 2565 per cent growth target whatever his misgivings mr alan greenspan the fed chairman will find it hard to resist administration pressure to cut rates before this autumns presidential election yet broad money growth may be misleadingly depressed the federal government via the resolution trust company has been issuing treasury bills which do not appear in m2 and simultaneously writing off thrift deposits which were included meanwhile loose monetary policy may perversely be depressing monetary growth low shortterm interest rates may have persuaded small investors to withdraw savings from time deposits and invest them at longer maturities where the yields are higher stripping out small time deposits and money market mutual funds from m2 raises its growth rate to m1 proportions as the lefthand charts shows the bank of japan faces similar difficulties while m1 growth remains at historically high levels the growth of its favoured money supply average m2 plus certificates of deposit has collapsed the boj anxious to resist another interest rate cut argues that this slowdown results from shift of savings into postal saving deposits which are excluded from broad money but growth of both bank lending and broad liquidity which includes the postal savings is also sluggish in germany broad money growth rates suggest that inflation not recession remains the main threat the yearonyear growth rates have risen sharply in recent months but the peculiar measure of broad money growth rates stressed by the bundesbank paints a more alarming picture its target range for m3 growth of 3 12 5 12 per cent in 1992 refers to growth relative to the average level of m3 in the fourth quarter of 1991 rapid money growth in december and january meant that the annualised monthly rate was already 89 per cent in january it has since remained outside the target range there are a number of reasons why german broad money growth might be artificially inflated the growing use of the dmark as a reserve currency in eastern europe is one possibility another is the large negative differential between short and long interest rates the opposite from the us where this yield ratio is positive which may be encouraging investors to shift into shortterm assets yet the main force propelling m3 growth according to the bundesbank is the volume of bank lending to companies and individuals the april money supply figures show a strong rise in short term lending which may according to mr paul brunker of robert fleming securities reflect distress financing by companies facing a slowing economy but m3 growth is not expected to fall within the bundesbanks target range in 1992 until it does a significant cut in german interest rates is unlikely while the risk of a german recession will remain international economic indicators money and finance this table shows growth rates for the most widely followed measures of narrow and broad money a representative short
