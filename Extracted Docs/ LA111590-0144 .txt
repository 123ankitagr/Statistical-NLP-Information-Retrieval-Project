Greg Lewis , the Pacific 10 Conference 's leading rusher , underwent arthroscopic surgery on his left knee Wednesday and will miss Saturday 's game against Washington State , Washington Coach Don James said . James said it is uncertain whether Lewis , who will be replaced by Beno Bryant , can play in the Rose Bowl game . Lewis had cartilage torn in his knee during last Saturday 's loss to UCLA . The 10th-ranked Huskies also will be without free safety Tommie Smith , suspended for missing class , on Saturday .
