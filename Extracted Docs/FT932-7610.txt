mr clive smith was 25 years old when he made his first million pounds he had started with one truck built up a transport company and sold it to unilever mr smith had expanded the business by trucking subsidised meat from the irish republic to turkey he claims that by the time he sold it comarte europa international was the biggest international refrigerated transport company in the european common market that sale was in 1974, paving the way for mr smith a self-made man with a flair for deal-making to move on to promote the stock exchange flotation of several natural resources companies in the 1980 s at the moment his career has hit a sticky patch the share prices of many of the companies in which he has substantial shareholdings have collapsed the serious fraud office is investigating possible irregular share dealings in two of them butte mining and richmond oil gas and he is negotiating with his cred-itors he had a three-year contract with unilever to continue managing comarte but his style did not match that of a big corporation and the contract was ended by mutual agreement after 12 months he subsequently owned and managed companies in industrial property plant hire industrial chemicals and car hire and leasing he once told a colleague that he became fascinated by commodity trading then one day which is for ever etched in his memory he made a pounds 100,000 profit in the morning but lost pounds 250,000 in the afternoon i realised commodity trading could become addictive so i quit he said mr smith had his first taste of what the natural resources sector had to offer in september 1977 when he acquired parkland colliery a private coal mine needing modernisation it was a wonderful deal parkland had cash in its books but he bought the company on deferred terms he had already established drawing on his transport and plant hire experience that parkland owned a great deal of good saleable mechanical equipment and plant asset sales covered the whole of the purchase price colleagues say the simplicity of the parkland deal made an indelible impression on mr smith he always looks for deals where there is no downside for him said one in 1978 he acquired podmore hall colliery company which had a license to mine substantial coal reserves by 1981 podmore had become the biggest privately owned coal mine in the uk that year both coal companies which had been bought for a total of pounds 250,000, were sold to anglo international mining for pounds 1.875 m mr smith said at the time that he sold out of coal because he felt that investment in the production and development of oil and gas would show a greater return on his capital so he invested some of the proceeds in the us oil and gas industry in september 1981, with some partners he set up a chemical trading company to supply the oil and gas industry through the contacts this brought mr smith was introduced to some oil and gas prospects and in october 1982 his company acquired its first interest in this sector in 1983 the company changed its name to petranol and in february the following year it was launched on the london stock exchange some 2.8 m shares or 27 per cent of the equity were offered for sale at 125 p a share valuing petranol at pounds 13 m mr smith controlled 3.8 m shares or 36.5 per cent worth at the launch pounds 4.75 m the petranol launch forced mr smith into the public eye for one of the very few times in his career it was a time when dallas was among the most popular television shows so for a while newspapers were calling him the jr of the potteries in fact his home is between nantwich and crewe and some of his acquaintances call him unkindly because he lost a thumb in a car accident the nine-fingered fat man from cheshire this is not entirely fair because although a little portly mr smith is not fat one acquaintance says it is just that he looks as if he lives on chip butties he has a benevolent but forceful north country manner and can be very charming but he can also be volatile if he is crossed he likes to bark at people and uses lawyers letters and writs a lot said one business colleague another said he is a guy who is easy to fall out with he can be very charming but he can be abrasive too like many north country businessmen often with good reason mr smith is very distrustful of the city and its establishment this distrust intensified after the petranol board in march 1986 voted him out of the chairmanship he subsequently left the board but was back in the limelight again only weeks later when petranol received an all-paper bid worth pounds 21 m from another small oil and gas company inoco the takeover panel intervened and took the unusual step of ruling that inoco and mr smith had been acting in concert it said inoco should add a cash alternative to its offer inoco did not have the financial resources for this so it had to drop the bid at that time it was said inoco owned 6.6 per cent of petranol and mr smith 25 per cent they undertook to reduce their combined holdings to below the 29.9 per cent which automatically triggered a bid mr smith seems to prefer to keep in the background often not even taking a non-executive directorship in those companies he has helped bring to market or in which his family trusts have big shareholdings consequently he uses a large number of people to do his bidding one person who has had business dealings with mr smith says he has more accountants and advisers than anyone i have ever known he also has used up more lawyers than anyone i have ever known mr smith recently described himself as an independent businessman who acts internationally as an adviser and consultant in the sale and purchase of companies generally with oil gas or mineral assets in the us virtually all of his interests are held in offshore trusts my entire affairs are dealt with offshore by different administrators he said recently he has told acquaintances that this is because he does not trust the city of london and its representatives in spite of this dislike mr smith took a substantial shareholding in corporate broking services set up by mr david wilkinson after he left tc coombes another stockbroker mr smith had several dealings with coombes which in the mid-1980s was one of the most aggressive broking houses in the natural resources sector coombes went into receivership and cbs went into liquidation in 1991 these brokers were involved with mr smith in the stock exchange flotations of butte mining richmond oil gas and globe petroleum launched first as far east resources mr smith also took a substantial shareholding in another resource company geevor which started as a cornish tin miner acquaintances speak in awe of mr smith's capacity for hard work he frequently commutes on the 7 am train from crewe to london and does not return until 11 at night you can often find him in his office at midnight said one in his more mellow moods mr smith frequently tells people that he is not interested in money for himself but is working to secure the future of his two daughters however some acquaintances suggest that like many entrepreneurs today he is not as rich as he once was and that many of his assets are pledged to the banks as collateral for loans
