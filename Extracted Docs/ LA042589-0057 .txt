Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : ' A One Way Ticket ' Dominican Republic , 1988 , 92 minutes 9:15 p.m. Based on an appalling real-life episode -- the brutal mistreatment of 40 illegal Dominican emigrants to the United States on the ship that was transporting them -- director Agilberto Melendez 's film slowly builds up an atmosphere of grim , low-key realism . Melendez does n't go for knockout blows ; his film seems initially ordinary as he mounts his case , sketching in several dozen participants , showing us the grimy mechanics of corruption and destruction . Where life is cheap and only money talks , the film quietly states , lives are not only cheapened , but expendable . RECOMMENDED.MICHAEL WILMINGTON
