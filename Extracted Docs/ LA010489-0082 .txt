tall and pale and young and handsome the guy from yugoslavia came walking he was my driver taking me from my sterile corporate los angeles hotel to lax so what do you do when you're not driving a car i asked him knowing that anyone who is young and handsome in los angeles has big plans you mean am i actor he said in a thick slavic accent no i am not actor i am screenwriter what kind of stuff do you write i asked amused i had heard that an l a newspaper once put a guy out on melrose avenue to ask passers-by how's your screenplay going nine out of 10 responded almost finished i write crap he said the way bela lugosi says i am count dracula i giggled but he continued in a passionately serious tone i write thrillers i write the crap that these people want to see he said gesturing to the mall-sprawl world we motored through what these people want is junk that's what they line up for i write that i do it only for money that's all i care about is money when i sell screenplay i get 200,000 if i wanted to be dostoevksy i'd write book i want money that's why i'm here that's why i write he explained that he left yugoslavia where he like his parents was an intellectual and a writer to come to the united states he said no country in the world has as much democracy and freedom as this country and what will you do with all the money i asked ah that is question that is very good question he said i don't know so do you have an agent i asked trying to decide if he was serious no no agent he said but i know a guy who knows stallone what we had here was a 28-year-old man with a degree in philosophy from the university of belgrade who had been in the united states for 18 months and already knew a guy who knew a guy this must be very hard for you writing in a different culture i offered are your stories set in europe no i only write about america it is not hard i know what to expect when i come here nothing surprised me i drove big american car like this in yugoslavia i wrote screenplays there but they pay nothing 5,000 here you write trash and they give you a lot of money that's why i come but what about the language problem don't you find it hard to write in english not a problem he said i write in yugoslavian i was trying to imagine the pitch meeting yo stallone i got piece of trash written in yugoslavian perfect for you so you have a story for stallone what's it about it's about a bodyguard who catches his boss in bed with the president's wife then he blackmails him the handsome screenwriter does in fact have a translator this driver is no idiot even if he is trying to write junk that stupid americans would line up to see he was inspired he explained by one of hegel's greatest hits have you read hegel's phenomenology of spirit he asked no i said but i did see ernest saves christmas we then talked about the master-servant relationship as hegel saw it as stallone might develop it but with your attitude i asked don't you think you'll have a problem at a pitch meeting isn't 95 of what goes on in l a just sales you must agree that the best salesmen are those who believe in their product yes could be problem he admitted but i will not tell them it is crap this all cheered me up i was well ahead of the game see my screenplay's in english and it ain't half bad
