Sir , Howard Davies , director general of the Confederation of British Industry , called for the state pension age to be equalised at 65 under the title of the 'pragmatic option on pension equality ' ( Personal View , August 7 ) . His concept of what is pragmatic , which is based on highly dubious cost estimates , is a bit limited since it takes no account of the actual pattern of retirements which are now taking place . Less than a half of men in the age group 60-64 are still working and less than half of women in the 55-60 age group ( despite the latter 's legal right to work as long as a man in the same job ) . Furthermore , about half of those who stop work before retirement age do so at the direct instigation of their employers , many of them CBI members , and a good number more retire voluntarily , but under pressure . MSF also has a pragmatic view of equality and that leads us to argue for a flexible decade of retirement extending from 55 to 65 , during which period most people retire , with the full pension payable at 60 when the majority are retired . We argue that the way to keep up activity rates among older workers is for determined action to be taken against age discrimination so as to make it more possible for people to work . This is the real issue that the government and the CBI should be tackling , enriching the employment possibilities of older workers and not conspiring to impoverish their often involuntary retirements .
