How marvelous to read Melvin -- formerly Mel -- Durslag in the Los Angeles Times . The more formal name ca n't presage a more elegant or sophisticated view of the sporting scene since he long ago scaled the heights in both those categories . Congratulations and thanks for acquiring his unique talents . E.C . BRESSLER , Los Angeles
