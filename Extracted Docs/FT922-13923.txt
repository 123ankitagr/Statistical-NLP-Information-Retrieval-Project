MARTIN CURRIE Pacific has agreed to take over fellow investment trust Pacific Horizon in an all-share deal . The takeover comes one month after a merger between CST Emerging Asia Trust and Pacific Horizon broke down . CST 's board then said that 'the value realisable by CST 's shareholders as a result of the proposals was uncertain' and that 'PHIT 's portfolio and performance , in terms of the decline in net assets per share since launch , provided no grounds for selecting PHIT as a merger partner . ' However , Mr Michael Kennedy , of Martin Currie , said the takeover took account of the uncertain element of Pacific Horizon 's portfolio . About 11 per cent of the portfolio , consisting of investments in illiquid closed end funds , was being excluded from the terms of the offer . These holdings will be sold separately and the proceeds distributed to Pacific Horizon shareholders . Martin Currie Pacific will offer shares at 92 per cent of the formula asset value ( FAV ) of the rest of Pacific Horizon 's portfolio ; this offer will be increased to 93 per cent of FAV if warrant holders approve the deal . Some 53 per cent of Pacific Horizon shareholders have agreed to accept the offer , which is recommended by the PHIT board . Pacific Horizon , which is managed by Jupiter Tyndall , was launched in 1989 out of the ashes of the Australia Investment Trust . Shares in the trust were initially offered at 50p ; they closed yesterday at 25p , up 2p on the day .
