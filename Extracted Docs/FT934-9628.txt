THE SOUTH Korean govern-ment will hold a meeting today to review security on the Korean peninsula as officials warn that time is running out for North Korea to resolve the nuclear inspection issue . The meeting , headed by President Kim Young-sam , will analyse military developments in North Korea , South Korean defence measures , and ways to resume talks with Pyongyang and possibly break the nuclear issue deadlock . The conference comes amid reports from the US and Japan that North Korea is massing forces along its border with South Korea , and a warning from President Bill Clinton that the US would defend South Korea if it is attacked . But the US said on Monday it had not detected any unusual military movements by the North Koreans , who normally station two-thirds of their army along the frontier with South Korea . Seoul is concerned that military tensions will increase over the next few weeks if the UN Security Council considers imposing economic sanctions on North Korea for violating nuclear safeguards . The US has said it could refer the nuclear issue to the UN Security Council 'within days ' .
