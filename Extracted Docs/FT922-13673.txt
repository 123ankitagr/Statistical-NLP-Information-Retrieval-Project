London 's City University has a new research fellow in Jewish Music . Or rather it has what is claimed to be the first research fellow in the world in this specialist area , with a brief stretching from liturgical music of the 12th century to Broadway musicals . And all thanks to Joe Loss , the band leader . Joe Loss - for many decades a familiar figure in nightclubs and a reassuring sound over the radio waves - died last year . His family is financing the research fellowship in his memory . The first Joe Loss fellow is to be Alexander Knapp , formerly of Wolfson College , Cambridge , a synagogue cantor and an expert on the Judeo-Hispanic ballade . He will be expected to lecture on the Jewish Foundations of Christian Liturgy - as well as handle the third year option on Tin Pan Alley .
