The national Republican Party leadership , spurred by chairman Lee Atwater , today cut all ties to former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke , the newly elected Louisiana Republican state lawmaker . Party spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said 28 voting members of the party 's executive committee unanimously repudiated during a telephone vote Duke 's racist and anti-Semitic views and barred financial or other assistance for him . Duke , 38 , a former klan grand wizard , was elected to the Legislature Saturday from a suburban New Orleans district in a narrow victory over builder John Treen , 63 , who was backed by President Bush and former President Ronald Reagan . The resolution adopted by the national Republicans in effect `` excommunicates '' Duke , according to Atwater , who said Duke is neither a Republican nor a Democrat but `` a charlatan and a faker '' using Republicans to promote his racist agenda .
