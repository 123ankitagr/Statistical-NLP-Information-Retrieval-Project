Survival rates for a common type of childhood cancer improved markedly at a leading medical center after doctors started using chemotherapy more aggressively , a study showed last week . In findings presented at the Society for Pediatric Research 's annual meeting , Dr. Laura Bowman of St. Jude Children 's Research Hospital in Memphis , Tenn. , said the overall four-year survival rate for neuroblastoma has improved from 37 % to 55 % during the last decade . Neuroblastoma , which originates in the adrenal gland or nerve tissue near the spinal cord , is the most common childhood solid tumor after brain tumors , Bowman noted . If the cancer is not caught in its early stages , it often spreads to the lymph nodes , liver , bone and bone marrow . In the past , doctors sometimes have been reluctant to rush childhood cancer patients into chemotherapy because of possible toxic side effects . But about 10 years ago , St. Jude doctors started using several `` front line '' chemotherapy drugs on neuroblastoma patients as soon as possible , Bowman said . Since that time , the four-year survival rate for children younger than 1 year old -- whose disease is often not as advanced as in older youngsters -- has climbed from 48 % to 89 % , the doctor said .
