The Labour MP , Mr Andrew MacKinlay , said yesterday he would protest to Mr Michael Heseltine , trade and industry secretary , about the fact that thousands of people who had been 'enticed ' into purchasing a Mercury One-2-One mobile telephone on the promise of unlimited free calls on Christmas day could not get through . Mercury One-2-One said at least 20 people had spent more than 12 hours on the phone on Christmas day . Another 20 had made more than 2,000 calls between them .
