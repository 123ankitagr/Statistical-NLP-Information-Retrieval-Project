MR DAVID MULFORD , the US Treasury under-secretary for international affairs , warned yesterday that the German fiscal deficit could persist for much longer than previously anticipated , creating a lasting drag on world economic growth . 'Germany has a large fiscal deficit and a tight monetary policy , and this is having a major spill-over effect in Europe , ' Mr Mulford said . 'It 's causing high interest rates and low growth , and contributing to unemployment , ' he said . The International Monetary Fund 's World Economic Outlook report this week also called for cuts in the German deficit to enable European interest rates to fall . However , Germany 's money supply continued to grow well outside its target range last month , giving a clear signal to participants at this Sunday's Group of Seven meeting in Washington that the Bundesbank will hold firm on monetary policy . Mr Helmut Schlesinger , Bundesbank president , will attend the G7 meeting of leading industrial countries with Mr Hans Tietmeyer , his deputy , but economists do not expect them to come under serious pressure to cut rates as a stimulant to the world economy . The Bundesbank has stressed its concern with the high rate of money supply growth compared with the target range of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent set for this year . In March , M3 , the broad monetary aggregate , grew at an annual rate of 9.75 per cent after 8.5 per cent in February and 9 per cent in January . Propelling M3 higher has been heavy bank lending , much of which has been to finance corporate investment in the east .
