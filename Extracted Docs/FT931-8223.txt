hopes for further sustained cuts in german interest rates were given a fillip yesterday after the bundesbank released figures showing that broad money supply traditionally the german central bank's key indicator in the battle against inflation fell in january on an annualised basis economists had expected the rate of growth in m3 to fall significantly from december but the annualised seasonally adjusted 2.3 per cent drop in m3 following an 8.7 per cent rise in december took observers by surprise when it was announced yesterday prompting an increase in german bond prices in expectation of further interest rate cuts the bundesbank said the figure was distorted taking care to emphasise that the drop reflected a number of special factors chiefly the reversal of the currency flows which had bloated m3 growth in the autumn of last year the bundesbank's currency market interventions helped send annualised m3 growth to a record 10.3 per cent last october another reason was purely statistical the bundesbank calculates the growth with reference to the previous three month's figures as these were exceptionally high it was inevitable that the january annualised figure would be vastly improved on the december m3 number economists were however expecting growth of around 4 per cent not a fall despite the bundesbank's attempts to play down the significance of the number economists were encouraged predicting that the bundesbank would be able to meet its growth target for m3 this year last year m3 grew at 9.4 per cent compared to a target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent the worst performance since targeting was introduced 18 years before the target was subsequently raised to 4.5 to 6.5 per cent for 1993 the bundesbank said that on a straightforward year-on-year basis m3 which includes cash current accounts and short-term deposits grew by 7.5 per cent measured against the previous six months it grew by 6.5 per cent norway and ireland both cut short-term interest rates yesterday our foreign staff adds norway's central bank cut the key overnight lending rate to its lowest level since the rate was introduced in 1986 the cut in the benchmark rate the third this month was to 9.25 per cent from 9.50 per cent from monday the move followed a period of strength in the krone and low money market rates norway uncoupled the krone from the european currency unit on december 10, and the currency has since fallen the central bank also lowered the rate for overnight deposits the credit rate to 8.25 per cent from 8.50 per cent the key rate reached 25 per cent last november during turbulence in the scandinavian currency markets meanwhile in ireland the central bank cut its short-term lending facility stf by three quarters of a point to 13 per cent its first reduction since it was raised by 3 points last september at the beginning of the erm crisis the stf was restored only two weeks ago at its suspension level of 13.75 per cent having been withdrawn in november as the currency crisis deepened it was temporarily replaced by an overnight lending facility which at times soared as high as 100 per cent as the bank sought to ward off speculation on the punt see lex page 24
