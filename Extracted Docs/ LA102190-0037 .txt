New York 's Times Square is coming alive with new hotels , but few as inexpensive as Ian Schrager 's refurbished Paramount on West 46th Street . This is the theater district , and who can argue with the prices : 40 % of the Paramount 's 610 rooms cost $ 100 or less . ( Doubles up to $ 170 . ) Schrager spent a bundle spiffing up this old ( circa 1927 ) hotel . Writer William Norwich called the Paramount a `` high-tech inn for the hip un-rich . '' No argument . It 's chic . Guest rooms are described as whimsical , but you 'd best like white and checker-board-patterned carpets . Even the beds are white . French designer Philippe Starck used blowups of Vermeer 's 17th-Century `` Lacemaker '' for headboards . Starck did French President Mitterrand 's bedroom at the Elysee Palace , so who 's to argue ? Baths feature conical-shaped wash basins with live red roses . Other flowers are strewn throughout the hotel . Schrager weeps . Says his floral bill figures to run $ 250,000 a year . Still , business is rosy . Open only a few weeks , the Paramount is boasting 90 % occupancy . Staffers in the lobby dress tuxedo-casual with T-shirts , substituting for formal shirts . Schrager describes the lobby as resembling `` a big living room -- a stage '' where guests seated on the mezzanine study other guests in the lobby . In breaking with tradition , Schrager installed a playroom for youngsters . This along with a $ 1 movie theater with popcorn and penny candy . Coming up next : a supper club in Billy Rose 's old Diamond Horseshoe nightclub . Says Schrager : `` We give our guests dreams . We give them magic . '' His hero ? Walt Disney .
