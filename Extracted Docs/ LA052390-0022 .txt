i was pleased to see cranstons thoughtful analysis of the peace dividend he clearly has recognized that the real danger to our security comes from wasted lives and crumbling infrastructure and not from soviet missiles i would like to have seen him allocate a small fraction of the peace dividend toward helping developing nations overcome hunger and poverty the harvest of peace resolution introduced in the senate by sen mark hatfield rore sets forth a vision of a world in which money spent on arms is directed instead toward human needs and in which the us provides leadership in reducing arms sales and resolving conflicts by negotiation i hope that now that cranston has completed his study of the peace dividend he will join in cosponsoring this resolution paul c eklof costa mesa
