while many no doubt forgot that yesterday was fathers day woe betide any one who forgets mothers day thats certainly the case in the us where pops day runs a distant second to moms day on most counts us mothers had their special day for 58 years before their spouses were so honoured they also still get 50 million more cards as well as far more phone calls from the kids than the fathers get on their appointed occasion but us dads can still claim one victory over their wives according to at t the portion of collect calls on fathers day was 27 per cent higher last year than on mothers day
