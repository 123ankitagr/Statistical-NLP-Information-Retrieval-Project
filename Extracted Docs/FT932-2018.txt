While many no doubt forgot that yesterday was Father 's Day , woe betide any one who forgets Mother 's Day . That 's certainly the case in the US where pop 's day runs a distant second to mom 's day on most counts . US mothers had their special day for 58 years before their spouses were so honoured . They also still get 50 million more cards , as well as far more phone calls from the kids than the fathers get on their appointed occasion . But US dads can still claim one victory over their wives . According to AT & T the portion of collect calls on Father 's Day was 27 per cent higher last year than on Mother 's Day .
