there was an error in the reply miras on two homes given last week the correct reply is as follows as a married couple you and your husband can receive mortgage interest tax relief on only one property even if the house is your main residence and the flat is his main residence it makes no difference whose names the properties are in usually where a married couple own two properties one of them will be their joint main residence in your case probably the house if in fact you and your husband will have separate main residences the one you bought first will be treated as your joint main residence for mortgage interest relief purposes this tie-breaker rule to which this refers is at section 356 b 5 icta 1988 no legal responsibility can be accepted by the financial times for the answers given in these columns all inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible
