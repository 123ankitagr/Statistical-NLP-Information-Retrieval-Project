Reports of an outbreak of plague in more than 200 cities in China were a 'fabrication ' , although seven cases of the disease had been detected since June , an official report said . Xinhua news agency , quoting an unnamed health official , said the disease was immediately brought under control after the cases were detected in remote regions of Tibet and Qinghai province , in south-western China . The report said China had an average of 10 cases of plague a year , having tamed the disease in 1955 .
