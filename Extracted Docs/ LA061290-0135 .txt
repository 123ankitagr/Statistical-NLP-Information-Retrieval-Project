NO SWEAT ? Will his vote against the sweatshop bill ( B1 ) cost Assemblyman Curt Pringle ( R-Garden Grove ) votes in his district , where the sweatshops are located ? . . . Hard to tell , says Democratic opponent Tom Umberg , who plans to make an issue of it . . . . Pringle found the bill unfair to manufacturers , but Umberg called it an issue of values : `` This was a choice between corporations and children . . . . Whether he loses votes or not , he 's on the wrong side . '' Mark I. Pinsky and Steve Emmons
