Complaining that neighborhood safety is being compromised by an absence of sidewalks , a group of Walnut residents have persuaded the City Council to fund the improvement along Regal Canyon Road south of Amar Road . The residents , who appeared before the council last week , cited a traffic study that showed that 479 vehicles pass along the road each day . They argued that children ca n't ride their bicycles along the winding road without peril and that pedestrians are at risk of being hit by vehicles . Before unanimously approving the construction of sidewalks at a maximum cost of $ 20,000 , the council asked city staff to determine how many other streets lack sidewalks and to define the city 's responsibility in installing them .
