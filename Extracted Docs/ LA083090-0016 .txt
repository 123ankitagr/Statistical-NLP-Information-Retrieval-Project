No Go : Mothers Against Drunk Driving will not be allowed to parade images of death at a wine festival in Kalamazoo , Mich. MADD 's display was to have featured headstones for the Sept. 8 parade . The float was turned down because its theme was n't consistent with the rest of the parade , said event chairman Brian Caplan . Michael Hughes , president of the local MADD chapter , was n't worried about drinking at the event : `` I 'm worried about when they get behind the wheel . '' Right Rub : Pia Zadora had a stiff neck when she went to WNBC-TV in New York for an interview recently , so her hairdresser began rubbing it . Sen. Al D'Amato ( R-N.Y. ) also happened to be in the studio and said : `` Here , let me try that , '' according to the New York Daily News . Said Zadora : `` He managed to get rid of the cricks in my neck without so much as breaking his chain of thought . '' Doing Better : Dr. Thomas E.
