in an 11thhour move two companies controlled by rupert murdoch have bid $ 18 billion for mgmua communications co which was slated to merge in two weeks with qintex an australian company if murdochs slightly higher bid succeeds he would control two major hollywood studios that together captured nearly 22 of the box office in 1988 mgmua said that its directors will meet today to consider the offer made jointly by news corp ltd and fox inc the parent of rival film studio 20th century fox film corp mgmua is being pressed for an answer within 24 hours according to one executive familiar with the bid the lastminute maneuver is reminiscent of paramount communications surprise bid for time inc in june as that company was about to merge with warner communications inc the paramount bid was ultimately defeated but it intensified the current wave of consolidation in the media and entertainment industries and murdochs bid provided fresh evidence if hollywood needed any that fraternal courtesies are fast disappearing just four months ago after qintex announced its deal with mgmua murdoch gave a party for qintex chairman christopher c skase to introduce him to the creative community everybody in town was there a rival studio executive recalled wednesday adding cynically welcome to the jungle mgmuas immediate fate will be determined by 72yearold financier kirk kerkorian who has controlled mgm for the last two decades and acquired united artists in 1981 mgm stripped of assets over the years kerkorian has stripped historic mgm of many assets including the mgm studio lot and film library but he has also bought back some assets such as the mgm name and roaring lion logo which he planned to repurchase again from qintex mgmua shareholders were scheduled to vote sept 23 on the qintex deal murdochs offer if accepted would end kerkorians whimsical 20year reign according to an internal mgmua memo circulated wednesday news corp and fox indicated that they intend to operate the mgmua businesses aggressively which would mean mgmuas survival as a major film distributor one insider contended to murdochwatchers the lastminute bid underscores his commitment to obtaining more programming for his farflung media and entertainment holdings which include sky television a british satellitefed television service good longterm move financially its a very expensive move strategically its a very good longterm move said john tinker a securities analyst at morgan stanley co in new york news corp believes that there is an increase in demand worldwide for programming the best way to meet that is to make more movies and to keep building an international distribution pipeline such as sky television murdoch has an insatiable appetite for these properties said one wall street trader and another securities analyst declared hes like a shark he cant sleep both men who asked not to be identified said they believe murdoch may be paying too much mgmuas sale has been expected for nearly 18 months ever since the company announced that it had received offers from weintraub entertainment group and a family partnership led by former fox owner marvin davis after that announcement a number of companies looked over the mgmua assets including every major studio with the exception of columbia pictures from other continents the interested parties included polygram sony and c itoh co but mgmua eventually settled on qintexs offer to pay $ 20 for each share of common stock offer put at $ 16 billion qintexs offer is valued at about $ 16 billion including the assumption of $ 400 million in mgmua debt but the australian firm would actually spend closer to $ 600 million after reselling certain mgm assets to kerkorian the two offers are difficult to compare because murdoch would acquire the entire company by paying $ 2316 for each share of common stock while qintex has offered just $ 20 a share but intended to sell back certain assets mgmuas stock rose $ 150 to close at $ 2125 on the new york stock exchange with 734700 shares changing hands news corp which was not identified as the bidder until late wednesday lost 125 cents a share to close at $ 25 on the new york exchange qintex has been plagued by rumors that it was having difficulty arranging financing for its mgmua deal but the company announced just last week that it had obtained a $ 400million commitment from its bankers in addition to owning an australian television network qintex operates resorts and holds a controlling stake in a los angeles tv production company that scored a hit last season with the miniseries lonesome dove antitrust worries cited earlier this year after mgmua spurned a lower murdoch bid it disclosed that it had haggled with fox over which side would assume the risk if the deal collapsed beneath antitrust objections fox apparently has not been deterred by antitrust concerns the justice department objected 10 years ago to kerkorians purchase of a 25 stake in columbia pictures but it lost in court later kerkorian sold the columbia investment since that case the justice department has allowed two other studio mergers to go through without a murmur i think the federal government will let it go but they shouldnt said one antitrust specialist who spoke on the condition that he not be identified according to data compiled by daily variety analyst a d murphy fox ranked third at the box office last year with 116 of ticket sales and mgmua ranked fifth with a 103 share together the two studios would have captured the top ranking from walt disney co which accounted for 194 of box office receipts in 1988 as of sept 4 fox had slipped to seventh place with a 64 stake and mgmua has garnered just 37 of box office receipts murphy said qintex chairman skase could not be reached for comment wednesday but the companys chief financial officer john lloyd said it is weighing its alternatives can cancel merger it would appear that unless it raises its bid qintexs options are few under the terms of the agreement mgmua may cancel the merger if it finds a more financially advantageous transaction so long as it pays qintex a fee of $ 182 million less than the $ 20million bonus that jeffrey c barbakow the mgmua chairman is set to receive if the company is sold for mgmuas hundreds of employees the murdoch announcement was just one more jolt in their rollercoaster ride since the company went on the auction block 18 months ago if the murdoch bid is accepted fox would have direct operating control of the company within 60 days to 90 days according to the mgmua internal memo one insider reacted cautiously theyre telling everybody in the company that fox is intending to run the company but who knows others were more skeptical citing similar promises when mgm acquired united artists and when columbia pictures merged with tristar pictures in both cases autonomy was reduced and jobs were lost weve heard that before at columbia and with mgmua the antitrust specialist said related story business page 1
