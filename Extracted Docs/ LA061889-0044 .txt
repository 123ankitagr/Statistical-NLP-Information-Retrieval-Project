Our first reaction to China 's cynical denial of the killings in Tian An Men Square is outrage . But we remind ourselves that the Big Lie is in the universal tradition of statecraft -- some lies are just bigger than others and some liars more brazen . Still , how can the Chinese leadership possibly think it can get away with it , given the witnesses and evidence on film ? By comparison , even the decision to fire on the demonstrators -- the tragic and brutal reaction of autocrats fearing a threat to the state -- seems `` logical . '' The dreaded answer appears to be that the Big Lie is being orchestrated precisely because the Chinese leadership is turning the clock back and reimposing political repression and isolation . Yet Deng Xiaoping reaffirms China 's goal of economic modernization . How can Deng expect that political and economic freedoms will be kept distinct and apart ? How does he imagine the Big Lie will survive his Long March generation ? How can he not realize , on the evidence of Mao and Stalin , that his Big Lie will be a deadly legacy to his successors that will surely further undermine communism 's legitimacy ? Sadly , this myopia is just the latest manifestation of an old condition : After over a hundred generations , old men in China still can not adjust to change or learn when or how to let go of power .
