China is to introduce a regulation preventing foreigners from taking part in joint ventures to produce colour televisions unless they import advanced technology , the English-language state-run China Daily said , Reuter reports in Beijing . 'No advanced technology , no market , that is the ministry 's policy , ' the newspaper quoted Zhang Jinqiang , vice-minister for the electronics industry , as saying . Foreign companies are eager to set up joint ventures in China with the aim of gaining a larger slice of China 's huge market for home appliances , the newspaper said . Since introducing its first colour television production line in 1980 , China has invested Yuan 20bn ( Pounds 1.5bn ) in the industry . China has an annual output capacity of 20m colour televisions a year and 15m tubes ; last year it ranked third in the world after South Korea and the US , with output of 13m sets , the China Daily said . Production is expected to reach 14m sets this year and 18m-20m by the end of the century . China exported 4.6m sets last year and the ministry hopes to raise this to 8m by the year 2000 . The production value of colour televisions accounts for about 40 per cent of the total of the electronics industry . About 80 per cent of urban families but only 10 per cent of rural families have colour television sets . China has 51 colour television manufacturers , of which five produce more than 1m sets a year . The demand for large-screen colour televisions has increased rapidly in cities in recent years , the newspaper said .
