AMERICAN Express , the US financial services group that has recently undergone significant management upheavals , is planning to sell more than half its majority stake in First Data Corporation . The disposal could bring some Dollars 1.2bn into American Express , which suffered a painful profits setback last year . First Data administers credit card transactions for companies such as Visa and Mastercard , as well as American Express itself . American Express said that it planned to sell 32m shares in First Data , with a further 3.2m becoming available if the offer went well . The sale could reduce American Express 's stake in First Data from 54 per cent to around 22 per cent . First Data shares eased Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 34.50 on the news , which came on Friday afternoon . At this sort of level , however , the disposal would raise around Dollars 1.2bn for the financial services group , ahead of sale expenses . American Express said that the proceeds of the sale would be used for 'general corporate purposes ' . The sale itself did not surprise Wall Street , although it is the first important move made by the company since Mr Harvey Golub replaced Mr James Robinson as chief executive of American Express earlier this year . American Express sold more than 50m shares in First Data last year , raising more than Dollars 1bn in the process and cutting its interest to the 54 per cent ownership level . American Express shares gained Dollars 1/2 to Dollars 25 5/8 on Friday's news . Net earnings at American Express more than halved for 1992 following a steep decline in profits within the group 's travel side and a slide into losses at Shearson Lehman , American Express ' brokerage and investment banking operations .
