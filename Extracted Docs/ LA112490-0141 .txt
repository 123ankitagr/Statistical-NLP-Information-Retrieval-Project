The value of commercial ( i.e. , non-residential ) building permits during the first nine months of 1990 is down 19 % compared to last year . Orange County has been hit harder than its neighbors , among whom San Diego is faring worst , with a 10 % decline ( and two , Riverside and San Bernardino counties , have increases over last year 's comparable period ) . Statewide , valuations are down just 3 % . The only real bright spot in Orange County non-residential building is with stores , where there has been a 24 % increase in permit values . All other categories have dropped , in a couple of cases by half .
