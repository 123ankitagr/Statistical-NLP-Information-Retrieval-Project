A congressman who had raised questions about telephone call-in games does not plan to investigate Players International 's new game , Players said . Executives of Agoura Hills-based Players made the announcement last week after meeting with Rep. Bart Gordon ( D-Tenn. ) and agreeing to cooperate in Gordon 's overall effort to eliminate abuses in the burgeoning 900-number telephone services industry . Gordon has questioned whether some of the games constitute gambling . In June , Players announced plans for a 900 version of the `` Jeopardy ! '' TV game show , and it is also planning a version of `` Wheel of Fortune . '' After Gordon 's concerns were reported June 13 , Players ' stock fell 30 % , but the stock rebounded somewhat after Players said Gordon does not plan to investigate its show . The stock closed at $ 5.375 a share in over-the-counter trading Monday . Players primarily operates a club that offers discounts to gamblers at casino resorts .
