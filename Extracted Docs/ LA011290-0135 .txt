A state-owned East German company has agreed to buy a small U.S. distributor of printing machinery in what officials said Thursday was the first foreign acquisition by a state-run East German firm . Veb Kombinat Polygraph Leipzig Werner Lambertz , a maker of printing machinery for the graphic arts industry , has agreed to buy its U.S. importer and distributor , Royal Zenith Inc. of Great Neck , N.Y. , for $ 25 million , according to the West German bank financing the transaction . Royal Zenith was sold by Dyson-Kissner-Moran Corp. , a New York-based investment firm . DKM did not require any U.S. government approval to sell Royal Zenith , which it had owned for about 10 years , said John Fitzsimons , DKM 's general counsel . Royal Zenith , which has been renamed Planeta North America Inc. , has been Polygraph 's sole U.S. distributor for about 30 years , said Allan Malachuk , president of the U.S. company .
