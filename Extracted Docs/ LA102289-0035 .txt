Yes , Guns N ' Roses ' song `` One in a Million '' uses racist remarks , but it uses them to show us how evil racism is ! The song does not reflect the band 's opinions ; they have explained that in many heavy-metal magazines . You have to show the ugliness of hate , just as you must show the ugliness of drugs .
