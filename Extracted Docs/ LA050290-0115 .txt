United Farm Workers founder Cesar Chavez received a standing ovation from more than 430 people who packed a UC Irvine auditorium Tuesday to hear him ask for support of the 4-year-old boycott of table grapes . The grapes boycott -- the third organized by UFW since it was founded 28 years ago -- is aimed at forcing growers to stop using pesticides , which Chavez and other union members blame for an alarming increase of cancer among farm workers in the Central Valley . The East Los Angeles-based roots-rock band Los Lobos made a surprise appearance to show its support for the boycott and for Chavez . Chavez is encouraging students at 11 Southern California campuses this week to fast for one day in observance of his cause .
