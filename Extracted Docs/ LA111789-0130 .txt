we were a bit late wouldn't you know it for an interview with the man who pays more attention to the time than anyone in this country so when we entered the tiny paper-strewn office of our nation's timekeeper we asked just what time it was this of course is exactly right he said in a heavy austrian accent pointing confidently to an unadorned black and white clock on the wall the only one in the room you can check it with that dr gernot m r winkler director of the u s time service department picked up the receiver of his desk phone and dialed direct to his personal ally in the quest to form a more perfect world through the synchronization of time the master clock of the united states u s naval observatory master clock at the tone eastern daylight time 14 hours 49 minutes 38 seconds beep universal time 18 hours 49 minutes 43 seconds beep the message coming through the receiver was clear and ungarbled it's exactly what winkler expects from the master clock a technological marvel that looks like a huge rack of audio equipment with a digital time readout and sits quietly in an environmentally controlled room about 10 paces from his office it's the keeping of precise time by this clock that is responsible for maintaining order around the country without it television broadcasts would interfere with each other satellites would go haywire and planes and trains would never know when to arrive my watch a relatively inexpensive timepiece with a degree of accuracy that doesn't even merit mention in comparison with the master clock said it was about 2 53 p m it was just a little fast we learned after receiving a couple of quick lessons in the more simple intricacies of the telling of time from the master himself the time lord as winkler's son has dubbed him lesson one the master clock tells time on a 24-hour system widely used by the military and radio communications and scientific community that means the day goes from 00 00 to 23 59 lesson two the world is broken into 24 time zones so everybody has sunlight at noon and darkness at midnight of the 24 time zones the united states is located in eight universal time is the time at the greenwich meridian the prime meridian from which all time zones radiate the meridian passes through london those are the easy lessons we were soon to discover we traveled to the u s naval observatory located on 75 acres in the northwest corner of the district of columbia which oversees the enormous task of keeping precise time vice president dan quayle lives in an aging mansion on these grounds and his tennis court is within view of the tiny time service building housing winkler his small staff and his master clock winkler 67, is a physicist and an astronomer who has been managing the time service department for nearly a quarter of a century time is a passion for this serious man who speaks of his aesthetic attraction to things precise taking off his glasses and fidgeting with them winkler sat back in his thickly padded desk chair and looked over a desk full of paper then he matter-of-factly explained that the first thing we needed to understand about time is that there is no such thing the simplest thing to explain what time is is to explain that it is just an idea which we developed from change and the abstract measure of that change is time said winkler with authority it's really a human invention the nature of time also makes it a subject ideal for humor the temptation to make a joke with every detail is so great we discerned the answers to our most burning questions about time early in the interview no winkler is very rarely late he thinks it's tactless and impolite he doesn't work around the clock nor does he watch the clock all day to pass the time he does have a theory of how to get more time in the day by not doing nonsense useless things reading 99 of what is printed today listening to 99 of what people tell you in other words by restricting yourself to the really valuable things you have a big amount of time you can be very well read by reading very little just don't fill your mind with garbage that's the only way with which you can gain time and a very effective one winkler said people take time for granted and don't really understand what the impact would be if time were not coordinated precisely the use of time is much more widespread than people realize you may not know for instance that every television station operates on an atomic clock which can be accurate to one second in every 300,000 years all the television stations all the power stations all the public services are very closely synchronized if you drive an airplane the systems that support that are very tightly synchronized what we do is clear up the problems in all these stations in which we are in constant connection part of winkler's job is to make adjustments to the clocks about once a year to synchronize the time determined by the rotation of the earth with the time kept by the atomic clock the earth's rotation is not constant and slows over a period of time so one second must be added to the master clock annually to synchronize the two called a leap second it is based on the same principal as the leap day which occurs once every four years the leap day is necessary to synchronize the calendar year with the solar year which also is slightly variable because of the inconsistency of the earth's rotation winkler and his staff also provide astronomical data obtained from a variety of very sophisticated telescopes that measure the positions and movement of cosmic objects for use in navigation space travel and scientific research
