bruised ribs flak jacket and all joe montana says he will be the starting quarterback for the san francisco 49ers in their showdown with the rams monday night in anaheim stadium it doesnt feel any worse than it has the last couple of weeks montana said of his rib injury ill be ready to play monday night surprised were you expecting steve young not when montana has started seven games against the rams in anaheim stadium and won seven times montana was removed from last sundays game with atlanta just before halftime after reinjuring his bruised ribs but he attended 49er practice wednesday and said he would join in thursdays workout it wasnt a day off for montana however it was the second of three days of electric stimulation treatment to his rib cage by trainer lindsy mclean every time i took a breath i felt this sharp pain above my rib cage montana said xrays were taken at halftime to rule out the possibility of a punctured lung montana said he could have played in the second half if needed but that the pain would have limited his mobility george seifert 49er coach making it clear that montana would be his starter against the rams expressed concern for his quarterbacks wellbeing if joe is healthy and i go by what he tells me and what our medical staff tells me hes our quarterback weve got a great quarterback whos banged up but hes played hurt quite a bit of his career and done a heck of a job montana has been sacked 29 times in 11 games six more than the comparable period last year raising questions about his protection maybe there could be more protection from the offensive line seifert said i know thats something were working on seifert also acknowledged his game plan included doing something new to combat the rams accent on the passing game jim everett is a fine quarterback and im sure the rams will try to do whatever they can to spread out our defense seifert said in the teams first meeting this season a 1312 ram victory on mike lansfords lastminute field goal everett hooked up with flipper anderson for a 65yard scoring pass play the games only touchdown in all anderson had four receptions for 112 yards i think anderson is awfully good seifert said hes a tough man to deal with and if their quarterback has any time at all hes been particularly effective in the latter stages of the game as he was in ours to combat the everettanderson combination and the expected return of henry ellard after a twogame absence due to a strained hamstring seifert said i think well have to do something different in contrast to the first meeting just to say well play our basic defense against them wont get the job done notes ram defensive end doug reed was put on injured reserve wednesday with a sprained ankle and rookie linebacker brian smith was activated to take his place reed the teams starter at left end was injured in the rams victory over phoenix nov 19 he will spend a minimum of six weeks on injured reserve effectively ending his season unless the rams advance through the playoffs in the weeks first injury report to league headquarters quarterback joe montana was listed as probable for monday nights game montana is one of three 49ers who lead nfc individual statistical categories montana is the toprated passer with a 1161 rating receiver jerry rice is the leading receiver with 70 catches for 1298 yards and kicker mike cofer leads the conference in scoring with 113 points with a twogame lead with three to play monday night doesnt present a mustwin situation for the 49ers but coach george seifert makes it clear he wants a victory badly a victory would not only wrap up the nfc west title but would ensure a homefield advantage throughout the playoffs how they compare how the 49ers passing tandem of joe montana and jerry
