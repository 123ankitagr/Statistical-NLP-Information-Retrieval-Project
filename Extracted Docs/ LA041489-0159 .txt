'' From the time I was 6 years old , '' playwright and director Luis Valdez told a Cal State Fullerton audience Wednesday night , `` I found myself asking , 'Who am I ? ' `` Valdez -- founder of El Teatro Campesino , creator of the stage hit `` Zoot Suit '' and writer and director of the film of the same name , plus `` La Bamba '' and `` The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez '' -- mused on the topic of identity , personal and cultural , as the university 's Distinguished Hispanic Lecturer for 1989 . As an artist , Valdez said , he seeks to define `` what it means to be an American . '' His writing has evolved from the highly political actos of the early days of El Teatro Campesino ( the Farm Workers ' Theater ) to become more introspective . `` My writing gets more personal as it goes , '' Valdez told a vocal and appreciative crowd in the university 's Little Theater . `` These days I know who I am , to a point . '' Valdez spent the day at Cal State Fullerton , giving two lectures during the day and meeting with students informally . He appreciates the chance to meet with students , Valdez said in a brief interview after his evening talk . `` It gives me the opportunity to discuss pure ideas , '' he said , `` Ideas motivate my work . '' Now hot in Hollywood after the success of `` La Bamba , '' which told the story of singer Richie Valens , Valdez said he is casting for a new feature film that will be completed in about a year . He declined to describe the project , other than to say it is `` about Europe '' and a break from the Latino-oriented themes of his previous work . He is directing the film but did not write it . Meanwhile , Valdez plans to revive the 1979 stage hit `` Zoot Suit '' for a national tour , with a stop next year in Los Angeles , site of its first success . Dates and location remain to be settled . He also remains active with El Teatro Campesino , which this year for the first time presented a Passion play at its base in San Juan Bautista , 35 miles northeast of Monterey . The play included a procession , was performed in front of the Spanish mission there and drew at least 1,000 people for each performance , Valdez said during his talk . Valdez was born in the San Joaquin Valley farming town of Delano in 1940 . His family became owners of a large ranch in 1941 , as did other Latino farm workers with the internment of Japanese-Americans in World War II . `` It was a wonderful ranch , '' Valdez said , with three houses and several barns . `` I was a landed Chicano . . . . We had land , but not under our fingernails . Then something terrible happened . The United States won the war . '' The government , which had supported and encouraged the Latino landowners in the early days of the war , abandoned them after the victory . The ranches were lost in a collapse of agricultural prices -- `` one by one they went out , like candles '' -- and by 1946 the Valdezes were once again migrant workers . It was a rude awakening for young Luis , who had grown up in relative affluence . `` I said , 'What the hell happened ? ' `` Valdez recalled . Then , expressing mock distaste , he asked , `` You want me to pick this ? '' Despite the poverty , Valdez said , he had one thing he still treasures : the wide San Joaquin Valley sky . `` We were poor , but we had the stars , '' he said , telling how he and his brother saved to buy a small telescope . His grandfather , a Yaqui Indian , refused to go to church but would stand each evening , hands on hips , and look at the sky . `` I did n't know he was revitalizing himself , '' Valdez said . He related early episodes of discrimination : being told to sit in the Mexican section of a cinema in Vallejo , the railroad tracks that divided the whites from the ethnics in Delano , not being able to play with the `` American '' kids . When he was 6 , he met Cesar Chavez , 10 years his elder . `` He was a pachuco , and best friends with my cousin , Billy , who was also a pachuco , '' Valdez said about the juvenile street toughs . Years later , when Chavez organized the grape strikes of the mid-1960s , Valdez organized El Teatro Campesino and toured the San Joaquin Valley with his troupe , playing for farm workers from the back of a flatbed truck . In Wednesday 's lecture , Valdez often invoked the name of Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr . He also quoted such disparate sources as Mao Zedong and Thomas Jefferson in a talk that , though entitled `` Latinos and the Arts -- Past , Present and Future , '' was more of an inspirational and philosophical discourse than a lecture . His appearance was sponsored by the university 's Chicano Resource Center , Chicano studies department , Hispanic Faculty and Staff Assn. , the theater/dance department and the Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan . Valdez , a small , compact man with a deep , booming voice , veered between humorous anecdotes ( with punch lines often delivered in Spanish ) and deeper ruminations . He closed with a theatrical flourish , his voice rising dramatically as he exhorted his audience to `` dream a common dream . `` America is a dream that binds us all together , '' he told the crowd and finished with a simple pun that summarized his message : `` What is art ? Thou art . ''
