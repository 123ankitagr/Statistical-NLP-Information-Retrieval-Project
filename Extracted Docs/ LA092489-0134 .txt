in billion years drifting continents reshaped earths face humans extinct changed evolution voyager 2 still cruising stars its mindboggling were actually going stars said bruce brymer voyagers lead mission controller nasas jet propulsion laboratory pasadena this spacecraft going outlive us its going forever in august voyager 2 swept past neptune icy volcanic moon triton last planetary exploration incredible 12year journey also took spacecraft past jupiter saturn uranus 50 moons interstellar mission now voyager 2 speeding loneliest part trek voyager interstellar mission with voyager 1 study suns magnetic field solar wind ultraviolet light distant stars galaxies like pioneers 10 11 voyager 1 explored jupiter saturn voyager 2 also search edge solar system the voyagers expected return information earth 2015 2020 contact eventually cut malfunction exhaustion probes plutonium power generators thruster fuel runs leaving unable point antennas earth then robot explorers pass among stars carrying 12inch copper record sounds sights earth case found spacefaring civilization hopefully understand peaceful humble attempt knowing exploring great unknown brymer said for voyager 2s work mundane the interstellar mission sort anticlimactic theres real drama expected were suffering blues little bit said its almost like postpartum depression weve gone highs spacecraft theres great sense melancholy its like none ive sensed voyager 2s encounter neptune officially ends oct 2 347 million miles past planet going 37337 mph it 283 billion miles earth traveled 446 billion miles since 1977 until december voyager 2 occasionally glance neptune dark space improve accuracy observations cameras instruments made neptune flyby said voyager project manager norm haynes pictures empty space let engineers measure much sunlight reflects voyager cameras a computer subtract light voyagers neptune triton photographs producing clearer prints haynes said in april planets positioned one voyagers take photographs assembly single picture solar system the planets small theres lots dark space said maybe give people better impression vastness things then engineers turn voyager 2s tv cameras infrared visible light sensors sensors already work voyagers interstellar mission officially starts jan 1 spacecraft already using remaining sensors make kind measurements continue collect years ultraviolet light cosmic ray sensors study distant galaxies stars also black holes pulsars remnants stars died fiery supernova explosions both voyagers also keep measuring magnetic fields electrically charged particles make solar wind waves wind if voyagers pioneers survive one may detect heliopause solar wind yields interstellar wind 5 billion 14 billion miles sun many scientists consider edge solar system by 2020 voyagers lose contact earth my electrical energy fading i feeling old useless says voyager 2s imaginary voice the voyager neptune travel guide national aeronautics space administration publication the planet gave life said goodby i longer hear voice heartbeat then voyager approach stars passing like distant beacons incredible void in year 20391 voyager pass within 321 light years 189 trillion miles proxima centauri nearest star about 24000 years pass oort cloud vast spherical cloud comets scientists consider true edge solar system then voyager makes open sea interstellar space free suns gravity wandering forever milky way galaxy going around center galaxy every quarterbillion years said cornell university astronomer carl sagan nasa estimates year 40176 voyager 2 fly 165 light years ross 248 first time closer another star sun 199 light years voyager near sirius year 296036 in year 296036 voyager 2 make closest approach sirius brightest star visible earth deep space benign dust cosmic rays erode voyager 2 extraordinarily slowly in billion years sagan said humans well extinct well somebody else there human artifacts left earth continental drift completely change continents look like but brave spacecraft surviving artifact species times perhaps one day aliens starship may find one voyagers play copper record they hear greetings 60 languages chinese welsh urdu including 7yearold boy offering salutations earths children there also music many cultures chuck berrys rock n roll mozart bach beethoven the aliens listen sounds surf wind rain thunder croaking frogs laughing hyenas train truck jet rocket baby crying lovers kissing photographs diagrams the record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs diagrams showing humans earth planets human chromosomes fetus golden gate grand tetons great wall china and extraterrestrials read message written july 16 1977 jimmy carter president nation little planet two months later dared send bit stars this present small distant world token sounds science images music thoughts feelings we attempting survive time may live we hope someday solved problems face join community galactic civilizations this record represents hope determination good vast awesome universe
