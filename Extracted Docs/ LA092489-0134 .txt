in a billion years when drifting continents have reshaped earth's face and humans are extinct or changed by evolution voyager 2 will still be cruising the stars it's mind-boggling we're actually going out to the stars said bruce brymer voyager's lead mission controller at nasa's jet propulsion laboratory in pasadena this spacecraft is going to outlive us it's going to be out there forever in august voyager 2 swept past neptune and its icy volcanic moon triton the last planetary exploration in an incredible 12-year journey that also took the spacecraft past jupiter saturn uranus and more than 50 moons interstellar mission now voyager 2 is speeding into the loneliest part of its trek the voyager interstellar mission with voyager 1, it will study the sun's magnetic field solar wind and ultraviolet light from distant stars and galaxies like pioneers 10 and 11 and voyager 1, which explored jupiter and saturn voyager 2 also will search for the edge of the solar system the voyagers are expected to return information to earth until about 2015 or 2020 contact eventually will be cut off by some malfunction by exhaustion of the probes plutonium power generators or when their thruster fuel runs out leaving them unable to point antennas at earth then the robot explorers will pass among the stars each carrying a 12-inch copper record of sounds and sights from earth in case they are found by a spacefaring civilization hopefully they will understand our peaceful and humble attempt at knowing and exploring the great unknown brymer said for now voyager 2's work is more mundane the interstellar mission is sort of anticlimactic there's no real drama expected we're suffering from the blues a little bit he said it's almost like postpartum depression we've gone through such highs with the spacecraft there's a great sense of melancholy now it's like none i've sensed before voyager 2's encounter with neptune officially ends oct 2, when it will be 34.7 million miles past the planet going 37,337 m p h it will be 2.83 billion miles from earth and will have traveled 4.46 billion miles since 1977 until december voyager 2 occasionally will glance at neptune and dark space to improve the accuracy of observations its cameras and instruments made during the neptune flyby said voyager project manager norm haynes pictures of empty space let engineers measure how much sunlight reflects off voyager into its cameras a computer can subtract the light from voyager's neptune and triton photographs producing clearer prints haynes said in april most of the planets will be positioned for one of the voyagers to take photographs for assembly into a single picture of the solar system the planets are small and there's lots of dark space out there he said maybe it will give people a better impression of the vastness of things then engineers will turn off voyager 2's tv cameras and its infrared and visible light sensors sensors already at work voyager's interstellar mission officially starts jan 1, but the spacecraft already is using its remaining sensors to make the kind of measurements it will continue to collect for years ultraviolet light and cosmic ray sensors study distant galaxies and stars and also black holes and pulsars remnants of stars that died in fiery supernova explosions both voyagers also will keep measuring magnetic fields electrically charged particles that make up solar wind and waves in that wind if the voyagers and pioneers survive one or more of them may detect the heliopause where solar wind yields to interstellar wind 5 billion to 14 billion miles from the sun many scientists consider it the edge of the solar system by about 2020, the voyagers will lose contact with earth my electrical energy is fading and i am feeling old and useless says voyager 2's imaginary voice in the voyager neptune travel guide a national aeronautics and space administration publication the planet which gave me life said goodby i will no longer hear its voice nor it my heartbeat then voyager will approach the stars passing them like distant beacons in an incredible void in the year 20391, voyager will pass within 3.21 light years 18.9 trillion miles of proxima centauri the nearest star about 24,000 years from now it should pass through the oort cloud a vast spherical cloud of comets that other scientists consider the true edge of the solar system then voyager makes for the open sea of interstellar space free of the sun's gravity and wandering forever in the milky way galaxy going around the center of the galaxy once every quarter-billion years said cornell university astronomer carl sagan nasa estimates that in the year 40176, voyager 2 will fly 1.65 light years from ross 248 the first time it will be closer to another star than to the sun which will be 1.99 light years from voyager near sirius in year 296036 in the year 296036, voyager 2 will make its closest approach to sirius the brightest star visible from earth deep space is benign so dust and cosmic rays will erode voyager 2 extraordinarily slowly in a billion or more years sagan said there will be no more humans because we'll be extinct or we'll be somebody else there will be no human artifacts left on earth continental drift will completely change what the continents look like but this brave spacecraft will be there a surviving artifact of our species and our times perhaps one day aliens in a starship may find one of the voyagers then play the copper record they will hear greetings in 60 languages from chinese to welsh to urdu including a 7-year-old boy offering salutations from earth's children there also is the music of many cultures from chuck berry's rock n roll to mozart bach and beethoven the aliens will listen to the sounds of surf wind rain and thunder croaking frogs and laughing hyenas a train a truck a jet and a rocket a baby crying and lovers kissing photographs diagrams the record also holds 115 electronically encoded photographs or diagrams showing humans the earth and other planets human chromosomes a fetus the golden gate the grand tetons and the great wall of china and the extraterrestrials will read a message written july 16, 1977, by jimmy carter then president of a nation on a little planet that two months later dared to send a bit of itself to the stars this is a present from a small distant world a token of our sounds our science our images our music our thoughts and our feelings we are attempting to survive our time so we may live into yours we hope someday having solved the problems we face to join a community of galactic civilizations this record represents our hope and our determination and our good will in a vast and awesome universe
