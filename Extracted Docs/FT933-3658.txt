BAFFLEMENT IS the reaction of most consumers to the growing competition between telephone companies for their custom . But it pays to consider shifting from BT . For most users the choice is simple . There are two national fixed-line operators - BT and Mercury . BT is invariably cheaper for local calls , while Mercury is generally cheaper for long-distance and international calls , especially in the evenings and at weekends . It generally pays to join Mercury if you make more than about Pounds 15-worth of long-distance calls a quarter . Mercury subscribers still use BT for local calls , and can take advantage of any BT special offers which undercut Mercury on certain calls . Both BT and Mercury offer volume discounts . BT 's standard tariffs are automatically reduced by 5 per cent for calls made after your bill has reached Pounds 88.13 in a quarter . Mercury 's are cut by 5 per cent when you reach Pounds 23.50 a month . BT gives a further discount after Pounds 293.75 a quarter , and its 'Option 15 ' gives 10 per cent off all direct-dialled calls in return for a quarterly fee of Pounds 4 . Since Mercury guarantees a saving of at least 20 per cent on BT off-peak basic rates for long-distance calls , most high-volume private customers are likely to be better off with Mercury . With a local cable operator the choice is more complicated . The table lists Nynex 's present tariffs . Each of the cable operators has its own , and the figures should not be taken to apply to the others . For instance , some companies offer free local calls between phones on their networks . Nynex 's line rental is Pounds 1.20 a month cheaper than BT 's , and its off-peak tariffs are about 2 per cent to 20 per cent below BT standard rates . Nynex says that for a Pounds 45 quarterly phone bill with a 'typical' distribution of calls , it is about 12 per cent cheaper than BT . Nynex has no volume discounts , however , and without them some of its long-distance and international tariffs work out more expensive than BT 's . Cable subscribers also lose their BT connections unless they pay to keep them up . Nynex offers its services in conjunction with Mercury , yet for many long-distance calls it is far cheaper to use Mercury via a BT connection . You can not take advantage of standard Mercury tariffs via a Nynex connection . Mr Ian Duncan , a Nynex marketing manager , conceded : 'We do not say that we are cheaper on every call - it 's very confusing . ' As competition intensifies , so will the confusion . So too will the number of cut-price deals on offer - provided you have a good eye for tariff sheets that look like railway timetables . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- THE PRICE OF A 5-MINUTE CHEAP-RATE CALL -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- BT Mercury Nynex Cable -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Local 10p 14.4p 8p National up to 56km 20p 14.1p 18p National over 56km ( on low cost routes ) 30p 23.5p 26.5p-29p National over 56km ( other routes ) 40p 31.5p 26.5p-29p France Pounds 1.49 Pounds 1.33 Pounds 1.46 US Pounds 2.37 Pounds 2.10 Pounds 2.17 Monthly line rental Pounds 7.65 * Pounds 6.45 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- Based on standard residential tariffs without volume discounts ; Nynex tariffs apply only in its franchise areas . * Mercury makes a Pounds 10 annual charge , but subscribers will also have a BT connection -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --
