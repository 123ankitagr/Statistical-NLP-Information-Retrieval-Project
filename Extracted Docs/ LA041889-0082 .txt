dr jay goldstein of anaheim hills has spent the last five years researching and treating patients with chronic fatigue syndrome a debilitating disease characterized by incapacitating exhaustion and a range of other perplexing symptoms explaining his theory of an unknown retrovirus invading the immune system inducing cells to produce a chemical transmitter affecting the entire body goldstein pauses you know the family practitioner says some very respected physicians will tell you i am crazy that's because in posing a medical explanation for the existence of chronic fatigue syndrome a disease with no known cause or cure goldstein is bucking conventional wisdom for years now many in the medical community have regarded the ailment as primarily psychological and they are wary of practitioners who pose unproven medical theories but in fact a growing number of the nation's most respected scientists are taking the illness very seriously researching various hunches and theories of their own as they reported at the first chronic fatigue syndrome conference held last weekend in san francisco dubbed yuppie flu once dubbed the yuppie flu and dismissed as a vogue ailment affecting neurotic women chronic fatigue syndrome is now believed to be a complex illness of immune dysfunction that affects people of both sexes and varying ages and ethnicity though there is little funding for its study scientists are hoping to understand more about chronic fatigue by scrutinizing viruses including the involvement of the newly discovered human herpes virus 6, or hhv-6 which has been linked to cancer and aids questioning whether chronic fatigue is linked to multiple sclerosis puzzling over how it is transmitted and experimenting with treatment even aids was simpler than this because it was caused by one virus and that virus is very new in the last 20 years it is more likely with chronic fatigue that a whole bunch of other old viruses and other infectious agents are all able to cause some people's bodies to act in a particular way to cause this disease said dr anthony l komaroff associate professor of medicine at harvard university and chief of general medicine at brigham and women's hospital in boston it is only since new technology has enabled us to take pictures of what goes on in the brain that many physicians became convinced this was an illness he said komaroff a presenter at saturday's conference attended by about 500 health-care professionals said he and other researchers speculate toxins heredity allergy and stress may work in concert with other factors to trigger the malady although statistics documenting its prevalence aren't available chronic fatigue syndrome has been classified as a disease by the u s centers for disease control in atlanta which is launching a four-year study in evaluating a grant proposal the cdc recently noted the illness appears to be reaching epidemic proportions nationwide there are more than 200 support groups for patients the cfids chronicle the journal of the nonprofit chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome assn based in charlotte n c publishes a bimonthly 70-page journal of advocacy information and research repeatedly chronic fatigue sufferers talk of callous treatment by the medical community through the course of her two-year illness conference speaker melinda paras 35, of san francisco said she dealt with seven practitioners at her health maintenance organization on one occasion she said she was told this is a seven-minute appointment i don't have time to hear your complaints after a battery of laboratory work paras was advised to take an aids test as terrible as it was to wait two agonizing weeks for the appointment and another two weeks for results it paled by what was to come she said absolutely the worst part of this disease came when i had a particularly acute attack and was so weak i couldn't breathe and could hardly move i was scared i called the hmo and the nurse-practitioner said there is nothing more we can do for you we recommend you seek psychiatric treatment paras recalled formerly a program coordinator for a nonprofit institution paras was stricken while on a business trip in washington she thought it was severe flu but in the next two months became so debilitated it took me 30 minutes to crawl to the bathroom and i had to take a nap on the floor for 30 minutes on the way back to bed another speaker tom hennessey a 35-year-old former bmw salesman who described himself as a very aggressive competitive person said he is now unable to work because of chronic fatigue and has spent his last 20,000 on medical expenses my life savings and individual retirement account are gone hennessey said and i have sold two cars i don't have the money to pay the may rent recently his claim for social security disability was denied he said he urged health-care workers assembled to support patients with letters and documents necessary for disability payments rent subsidies and food stamps we also need buddy systems to help us with chores such as cooking cleaning and taking care of ourselves he added many are struck in theirs 30 s and 40 s experts say more often women than men typically incapacitating exhaustion is accompanied by flu-like symptoms including sore throat swollen lymph glands drenching night sweats chronic cough painful and weak muscles and joints and dizziness some also exhibit multiple sclerosis-like symptoms such as disorientation memory loss inability to concentrate balance disturbances and brain inflammation the disease can last for six months or two years others never seem to recover there is disagreement on how long chronic fatigue syndrome has been around perhaps in different guises estimates range from the last 30 years to more than 120 in the 20 th century it has been identified as anemia a bacterial infection low-blood sugar environmental allergy bodywide yeast infection and more recently epstein-barr virus syndrome which causes infectious mononucleosis and other diseases however dr paul cheney of the nalle clinic in charlotte n c speculates chronic fatigue may be an old disease that has evolved if this had been around for 200 years with people this sick i can't believe we could have missed it for so long he said i think it's something that has existed as long as viruses but some new co-factor has been added as well in searching for clues scientists are trying to understand how viruses work singly and together as well as how they affect the immune system although hhv-6 and the epstein-barr virus don't cause chronic fatigue syndrome they may hold powerful clues researchers say evidence of virus we now have evidence that hhv-6 is present and active at the time chronic fatigue patients are sick komaroff reported citing a collaborative effort with dr dharam ablashi of the national cancer institute and dr berch henry of the university of nevada the finding may be significant komaroff said because an active virus can infect cells of the nervous system which might contribute to some or all symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome at the national cancer institute in bethesda md a high prevalence of antibodies to hhv-6 also has been found in patients with burkitt's lymphoma non-hodgkin's lymphoma and childhood acute leukemia researchers hypothesize that like the aids virus hhv-6 has the ability to kill the immune system's helper cells in the culture system we have found that when you can co-infect these cd4 helper-positive cells with two viruses the cellular killing effect is much faster than either will do alone said ablashi coordinator for dna virus studies at the national cancer institute in a similar vein investigators speculate that the combination of epstein-barr and hhv-6 might co-infect the immune system of chronic fatigue patients in a devastating manner still a puzzle just what goes on their immune systems is a puzzle it is very difficult to sort out the mix of what different agents may be causing this illness the only common denominator for all potential causes or co-factors seems to be the element of immunological dysfunction in all these patients cheney of the nalle clinic said cheney became interested in the disease while practicing medicine in the early 1980 s at the time he was inundated with patients from lake tahoe suffering from what he thought might be a chronic mononucleosis-type illness after years of research he believes the immunologic problem isn't necessarily a severe one like aids it looks as much like an allergy rather than being suppressed the immune system looks like it is hyper-responsive really fighting something theoretically he added the immune system's raging battle may be one reason chronic fatigue patients feel ill constantly virologist dr jay levy and his chronic fatigue syndrome research group at uc san francisco have been unsuccessful in attempts to isolate an agent that might cause chronic fatigue perplexed by patients whose symptoms resemble multiple sclerosis he poses these unanswered questions are these really ms patients or is this an early sign of multiple sclerosis in some people could chronic fatigue syndrome be an acute symptom of another virus that gives rise to multiple sclerosis in certain people another researcher dr david bell of lyndonville n y started seeing children with what he now believes is chronic fatigue syndrome in 1983 these children had large lymph nodes big spleens and were quite sick they still are sick today he said genetic or infectious after identifying 21 cases at a local school the pediatrician compared the youngsters with a group of 42 healthy children examining about 50 factors among his findings the people who got sick had a high rate of allergy implying a genetic marker there was a high rate of people within the same family becoming ill implying an infectious agent and people with the illness were much more likely to have been drinking raw milk after three years of research however the pediatrician has been unable to explain what role raw milk might play bell who is affiliated with the roswell park memorial institute a cancer research center in buffalo n y reflects a common complaint about lack of research grants when you see a disease that is so devastating to the lives of children and families it is remarkable that so little has been done about this i see children who haven't been out of bed in a year and yet there is very little government response he said also of concern to doctors is the impact the illness appears to have on the brain cheney said brain tests in some patients reveal unexplained white lesions of the cortex the brain's outer layer of gray matter and abnormalities in the temporal lobes where vision hearing memory and emotion are processed our scans mapping electrical activity show there are characteristics of brain lesions in almost all of the people who have chronic fatigue syndrome added goldstein of anaheim hills in some patients we see areas of decreased blood flow in certain areas of the brain cognitive problems these changes correspond with cognitive impairment i have seen iq tests drop 30 points i have a doctor in my practice who can't drive a car because he can't read street signs and mothers who don't remember the names of their daughters he said he theorizes that an unknown virus enters cells of the immune system of a genetically susceptible person inducing production of a chemical transmitter or cytokine other cells in turn make their own transmitter chemicals you can almost view the immune system and the brain as one organ the body is a network of these communicating systems goldstein said he speculates that by treating the brain the immune system can be altered experimenting with a drug that increases slow-wave sleep he plans to study in what ways this treatment might make people feel better other clinicians are also searching for treatments in some of her patients bay area physician dr carol jessop has found an imbalance of gastrointestinal bacteria and yeast caused she believes by chronic use of antibiotics a high-sugar diet birth control pills steroids or in some people an immunosuppression caused by an unknown viral agent meanwhile patient advocacy groups are becoming increasingly vocal jan montgomery of san francisco's chronic fatigue immune deficiency syndrome foundation was instrumental in urging city officials to form a task force resulting in the conference co-sponsored by the san francisco medical society the san francisco department of public health and the uc san francisco department of medicine and school of nursing and researchers too are coming to the defense of chronic fatigue patients i don't believe personally these are people who are primarily depressed or psychologically ill said dr leonard s zegans professor of psychiatry and director of professional education at the langley porter institute a uc psychiatric research teaching and treatment facility the disease represents powerful stress the psychiatrist said moreover symptoms such as impaired attention and anxiety alter performance at work or school calling self-worth and self-esteem into question not being able to work is especially devastating because many of these people are ambitious zegans added patients become isolated in part because not everyone believes they are sick he too suspects a virus latent in the blood stream maybe re-activated by a variety of causes including stress we are just now beginning to learn about the interaction between the nervous system and the immune system he told his colleagues at the conference we have a very complex system of checks and balances in the body and there perhaps are ways in which the equilibrium of body defenses can be altered i think in the next 20 years we are going to be learning a tremendous amount about this for more information about chronic fatigue syndrome
