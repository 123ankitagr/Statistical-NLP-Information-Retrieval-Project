could missed long said i think something existed long viruses new cofactor added well in searching clues scientists trying understand viruses work singly together well affect immune system although hhv6 epsteinbarr virus dont cause chronic fatigue syndrome may hold powerful clues researchers say evidence virus we evidence hhv6 present active time chronic fatigue patients sick komaroff reported citing collaborative effort dr dharam ablashi national cancer institute dr berch henry university nevada the finding may significant komaroff said active virus infect cells nervous system might contribute symptoms chronic fatigue syndrome at national cancer institute bethesda md high prevalence antibodies hhv6 also found patients burkitts lymphoma nonhodgkins lymphoma childhood acute leukemia researchers hypothesize like aids virus hhv6 ability kill immune systems helper cells in culture system found coinfect cd4 helperpositive cells two viruses cellular killing effect much faster either alone said ablashi coordinator dna virus studies national cancer institute in similar vein investigators speculate combination epsteinbarr hhv6 might coinfect immune system chronic fatigue patients devastating manner still puzzle just goes immune systems puzzle it difficult sort mix different agents may causing illness the common denominator potential causes cofactors seems element immunological dysfunction patients cheney nalle clinic said cheney became interested disease practicing medicine early 1980s at time inundated patients lake tahoe suffering thought might chronic mononucleosistype illness after years research believes immunologic problem isnt necessarily severe one like aids it looks much like allergy rather suppressed immune system looks like hyperresponsive
