The West Coast premieres of Denys Arcand 's `` Jesus of Montreal , '' Patrice Laconte 's `` Monsieur Hire , '' and Giuseppe Tornatore 's `` Cinema Paradiso , '' three of the hits of last year 's Cannes Film Festival , highlight the schedule of the inaugural Palm Springs International Film Festival , which begins tonight . Altogether , 46 films will be screened during the five-day event that Mayor Sonny Bono promised local merchants last spring would grow to rival the Cannes Film Festival , with film competition , markets and star tributes . The mayor 's first event is a modest beginning , with no world premieres , no film market and few stars scheduled to attend . But the event does boast a wide range of international pictures , including the opening night feature , `` Cinema Paradiso , '' an Italian film about a young boy 's fascination with movies shown in a village theater . `` Cinema Paradiso '' screens at 7 tonight at the Plaza Theater in Palm Springs . The Plaza is one of eight Palm Springs theaters turned over for festival programs . Among the other films scheduled are : `` The Killer '' ( from Hong Kong ) , a gangster drama by John Wood ; Percy Adlon 's `` Rosalie Goes Shopping '' ( West Germany ) , which is set in the rural American South ; Coline Serrau 's `` Romuald et Juliette '' ( France ) ; and David Lynch 's `` Twin Peaks '' ( United States ) Several American comedy classics are being shown in separate tributes to Bob Hope , Kirk Douglas , Frank Capra and James Stewart , though none of the honorees were planning to attend , according to a festival spokesman . In addition to screenings , the American Film Institute is hosting a series of seminars on acting , directing and cinematography . Information : ( 800 ) 366-FILM .
