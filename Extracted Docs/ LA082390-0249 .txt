Bill Cosby was wearing a Bart Simpson T-shirt with the radical dude saying `` Yo , Bill ! '' when he was asked if upcoming changes in `` The Cosby Show '' are a response to competition from `` The Simpsons . '' `` All of the changes were made B.B . -- Before Bart , '' Cosby told Entertainment Weekly in an interview being published next week . The magazine cover features Cosby wearing the Bart shirt . Fox TV 's runaway hit `` The Simpsons '' has moved from Sunday nights to Thursday , challenging NBC 's top-rated `` The Cosby Show , '' in a Bart vs. Bill match-up as TV 's top pop prepares to battle the smart-aleck Bart Simpson . Both air tonight at 8 p.m . The shows will be programmed head to head for the first time tonight , although they are both reruns . `` The Cosby Show '' starts its new shows in September , a full month before Fox will have new offerings of `` The Simpsons . '' Does Cosby feel pressured ? In his own conversational style , he seems critical of Fox . `` TV should be moving in a direction from the Huxtables forward , not backward , '' Cosby said . `` The mean-spirited and cruel think this ( the screwed-up Fox families like the bewildered Simpsons and the bitter Bundys of `` Married . . . With Children '' ) is 'the edge , ' and their excuse is , that 's the way people are today . But why should we be entertained by that ? '' he asks . Cosby said he 's changing `` The Cosby Show , '' re-energizing it with nine new writers , as a matter of principle . `` I 'm working harder and enjoying it more . And whether the audience is there in the numbers or not , I am proud of what we 've done , '' Cosby said .
