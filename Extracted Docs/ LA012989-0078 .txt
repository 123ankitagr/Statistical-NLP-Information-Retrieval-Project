I just want to let you know how much I enjoyed reading about Jersey and how much I enjoyed the aesthetics of the page itself . I particularly liked the personal touch Payne gave to his story . How nice it is to begin to get to know people as well as the places . With his parting message of good deeds coming back many years hence , a tear actually came to my eye . PAT LESAVOY Palm Springs
