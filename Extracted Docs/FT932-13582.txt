SHELL AUSTRALIA , yesterday announced the go-ahead for a ADollars 270m coal mine at Dartbrook in the Hunter Valley coalfields of New South Wales . The company said that the mine would produce up to 3.5m tonnes of steam coal a year , increasing the group 's Australian output to about 16.5m tonnes . Dartbrook 's production will be exported to customers in the Asia/Pacific region . The mine will consolidate Shell 's position as Australia 's third largest coal producer behind Broken Hill Proprietary and CRA , which is in the process of absorbing Coal & Allied , formerly the third largest producer . Shell is also considering developing another mine at Moranbah North , in central Queensland , which would produce about 3m tonnes of steam coal a year for the export market . However , production is unlikely to start for several years .
