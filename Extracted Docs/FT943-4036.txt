mother nature has scorched her poor gardeners all summer and as the end of the season approaches she is now softening them up with a kinder postscript gentle rain and intermittent sunshine show september at its best they also give us a chance for useful action while enjoying the one high-class performer in this testing year perhaps it has been the heat perhaps it is the passing of its seventh year but my evergreen magnolia grandiflora planted in 1987, has at last put lesser companions to shame never be shy of planting these heroic trees against a sunny wall when you start a garden mine has had 14 flowers this summer four of them open simultaneously as i write the myth that they need 10 years to flower in britain is irrelevant better forms have speeded the process as yet the plant finder the hardy plant society's list of more than 55,000 plants lists only one source for the maryland cross which will flower in its third year experts now speak equally well of saint mary but i am happy with my usual exmouth variety which is recognisable by its narrow leaves and flowers with smaller more widely-spaced white petals they last for a long weekend and then the lemon-scented flowers turn brown like suede and start to drop blame their fall on the beetles who find their way into the flowers and pollinate them their primeval duty since the years before the earth's last ice age who can be cross with the beetles when the slightest cooling on a september evening releases the scent which draws everyone to it grandiflora owners must soon decide whether to choose clear daylight through their ground-floor windows or whether to leave their magnolia to grow sideways on the wall outside and obscure the light these magnolias grow furiously and i will soon be hidden behind evergreens lost to the world beneath a pre-glacial canopy next spring the magnolia will have to be pruned meanwhile we should all be using the weekend on our evergreen backbones those hedges and shapes of yew and box now is exactly the right moment to clip and train them because their sap is running less freely and their growth will be less delayed by being stopped arm yourself with some bamboo canes a ball of string and a sharp pair of hand shears fix the canes at intervals down the front of a young hedge tapering them inwards slightly to give the slope or batter of a well-groomed hedge traditionally you should allow an inward slope of one inch to each foot of height stretch lengths of string along the canes and then cut the hedging back to its line striking firmly so that you do not leave split ends i hate cutting anything and would have disappeared by now in an undisturbed jungle if visitors expectations did not force me to give hedges a shape this year the clipping of yew has taken on a new attraction it is our chance to be useful and contribute to the nation's health you probably know the feeling of wistful waste when you are left with piles of green yew clippings too early in the autumn to be used in winter decorations it always seems sad to cremate them but now you can send them off for research at old house farm stubbs walden doncaster yorkshire john cook and his family have been farming 1,200 acres for nearly 40 years since 1991, their company friendship estates has branched out from green herbs into yew clippings they travel all over britain to collect them blow-dry them and send them to be milked for their vital extract known as 10-dab iii when purified this extract becomes docetaxel a current favourite in cancer research where high hopes are held for its medical worth friendship estates will come to your garden for the clippings of at least 50 yards of yew hedging it has 300 customers already and in its third year is collecting more than 100 tonnes of yew clippings fax on 0302-700958 or telephone on 0302-700200 if you have enough yew to help it is a prompt collector and has swept up the crumbs from the academic yews in a nearby oxford college already one hope for docetaxel is in the treatment of breast cancers among others clippings should be stored in a cool and shady place to a maximum depth of 9 in until they are collected friendship estates will lend appropriate bags and cool air fans to customers with a serious length of yew on offer it has been an awful year for hedge funds but i feel it is up to the gardening column to name one which will actually turn out to have some value if only the doctors would come up with a use for the leaves of my magnolias then it would not be so hard to cut them too let in the daylight and tell myself that i was striking a blow for a longer life
