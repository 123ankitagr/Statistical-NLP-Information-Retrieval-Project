Timber industry spokesmen asked the U.S. Forest Service on Friday to speed up logging of trees killed by the 3-year-old drought in California 's mountain forests . `` We think there are about 6 billion board feet of dead trees between Lassen County and the Mexican border , and they ought to be removed because they will be a fire hazard next summer , '' said Kevin Ekery , spokesman for the lumber industry 's Alliance for Environment and Resources . Both the Forest Service and the California Department of Forestry agree that as much as 20 % of the timber in the central Sierra may be dead as the result of the drought .
