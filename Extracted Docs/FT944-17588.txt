at nkks keihin steel complex on a manmade island in tokyo bay nine researchers from seven japanese steel companies are working on a technique they hope will produce a cheaper cleaner and more efficient way of making steel the researchers are in the penultimate year of an eightyear project sponsored by the japanese government to research the commercial viability of direct iron ore smelting which eliminates two of the most expensive and messy parts of steelmaking the japanese are one step ahead of countries such as the us and australia in the race to commercialise the process according to ken kanamori a senior engineer from nippon steel who is leading the project the japanese team say they have successfully produced pig iron at a pilot plant built next to a conventional blast furnace nkk shut down because of recession in conventional processing a standard blast furnace requires the two raw ingredients coking coal and iron ore to be processed separately before they are put into the furnace to make molten iron coking coal is turned into burnable coke by baking in ovens raw iron ore is converted from its powdered state into lumps in a process called sintering the two materials are then transferred to the blast furnace to be melted into pig iron which is processed into steel the japanese group has removed the need for the separate coking ovens and sinterers by building a blast furnace with two smaller furnaces attached to the top one above the other the iron ore powder is poured into the top of the structure and passes through the two small furnaces where it is sintered using gases generated when ordinary coal rather than coke is put directly into the main chamber and burned the iron ore passes through the two furnaces at the top and mixes with the coal in the main furnace to produce pig iron we estimate that the cost of producing steel can be cut by around 10 per cent using this method kanamori says he adds that coking ovens and sinterers are the biggest investment a steel company must make since japans top five steel makers are expecting to lose a collective y123bn pounds 779m in the six months to september they are likely to consider the y15bn project 75 per cent of it from the government as money well spent the pilot plant produced 500 tonnes of pig iron in a trial run earlier this year the test used 800 tonnes of coal against the 840 tonnes of the more expensive coking coal normally needed to produce the same amount the team says the pig iron can also be fed into electric arc furnaces used by minimills kanamori says the quality of the pig iron is almost the same as that from a regular blast furnace but it is likely to take at least another 10 years before the process is able to produce steel in large enough quantities to be commercially viable
