quick name two ways to reduce the risk of high blood pressure we're betting you know the answer lose weight if necessary and cut back on salt but if we asked you to name a third measure the answer might not come as easily even though it's just as simple increase intake of potassium this advice comes backed by a special committee of the national research council which recommends that adults consume 3,500 milligrams of potassium a day some groups are already eating that much others are not recent estimates show that 15 to 20-year-olds take in 3,400 milligrams daily diets of an urban white population provided 2,500 milligrams while studies of black americans have found intakes as low as 1,000 milligrams a day sodium may get more press but our bodies contain twice as much potassium just over half-a-pound most is found within the cells together with sodium it regulates the salt and acid-base balance of the fluid environment of healthy cells the amount outside the cells though smaller is equally important contributing to transmission of nerve impulses control of skeletal muscle contractions and maintenance of normal blood pressure dietary deficiency doesn't usually occur it can develop when large amounts are lost by prolonged vomiting chronic diarrhea or laxative abuse excessive losses are also linked to certain diseases and use of some diuretics patients on such medications often are advised to take them with orange juice or a banana both packed with potassium over several decades evidence has mounted that eating more such potassium-rich fruits and vegetables may benefit not only hypertension patients but the population at large although not always consistent some studies indicate that low levels of dietary sodium coupled with high intake of potassium may reduce blood pressure and high potassium intake meaning at least 3,500 milligrams daily may by itself protect against death from stroke in one study it was estimated that an increase of just 400 milligrams a day of potassium over a 12-year period led to a 40 decrease in incidence of stroke-related death why this happens is not yet known but until research provides the answer we're left with the recommendation to take in 3,500 milligrams a day the next question is does your diet meet the test bear this in mind fruits and vegetables unless processed with salt are naturally low in sodium and for this reason are often mentioned as preferred potassium sources yet most other foods also contain the mineral a cup of milk has 355 milligrams a slice of whole-wheat bread 63 milligrams and an ounce of hamburger 81 milligrams now let's run through a typical day's menu breakfast might include four ounces of orange juice 238 milligrams a cup of oatmeal 146 milligrams three-quarters cup milk 266 milligrams and coffee 65 milligrams the total is 715 milligrams 20 of the target a bag lunch could be a sandwich made with whole-wheat bread 326 milligrams and two tablespoons of peanut butter 200 milligrams along with carrot sticks 145 milligrams a glass of milk 355 milligrams and a fresh pear 260 milligrams for dessert lunch thus gives you 1,286 milligrams or 36 more a dinner consisting of four ounces of lean steak 396 milligrams a large baked potato 844 milligrams a medium stalk of broccoli 293 milligrams a glass of skim milk 355 milligrams and a cup of pineapple chunks 266 milligrams adds 2,154 milligrams bringing the day's tally to 4,155 milligrams even without snacks that might round out this bare-bones menu clearly a menu planned with an eye to general principles of good nutrition can easily provide 3,500 milligrams of potassium or more even if your meal doesn't include such potassium powerhouses as baked potato there are alternatives dried apricots prunes cooked kidney beans celery spinach avocado and winter squash all provide 300 milligrams to 600 milligrams of potassium per half-cup one rung down are bananas tomatoes orange juice cooked lentils brussels sprouts and cantaloupe with 200 milligrams to 275 milligrams per half-cup other fruits and vegetables contain 70 milligrams to 170 milligrams per half-cup and we often eat servings larger than that anyway there's no reason to suggest that taking potassium supplements will ward off hypertension yet a diet rich in potassium might be of benefit and this possibility provides one more reason to eat plenty of fruits and vegetables such a diet dates back to that of prehistoric hunter-gatherers who depended heavily on potassium-rich roots fruits tubers nuts grains and seeds for calories read ingredient list on turkey products question is it true that some turkey products have skin ground up in them answer some do and that adds considerably to the fat content of the product one way to tell whether the ground poultry you're buying contains skin as well as flesh is by inspecting the ingredients list if you find the words turkey meat or chicken meat you can assume you're getting the lean part only if the list includes plain terms like turkey or chicken or even chicken breast then the producer may within the limits of government regulation add ground skin to the product q i buy sunflower seeds in bulk so there is no labeling information my calorie chart says that two ounces of the seeds contain 170 calories does that mean two ounces including the shell or just the edible seeds a that figure includes the shell two ounces of the edible seeds would contain about 325 calories if you don't have ready access to a scale you may find it more useful to think in terms of household measures a cup of seeds in the shell which yields about one-third cup of edible kernels provides 255 calories as you may know sunflower seeds are high in fat an attribute useful to birds and squirrels trying to survive the winter but not always so desirable for humans protein and carbohydrate account for a little more than 30 of the calories the rest are from fat sunflower seeds contain some b vitamins and are a good source of iron they also provide a bit of calcium although in that department they're no competitor for milk q i've read that a nursing mother should consume about 500 calories a day more than normal during the first six months of her infant's life what is the basis for that statement a on average milk from well-nourished mothers contains about 70 calories per 100 milliliters it's estimated that the conversion of calories consumed when the mother eats to calories in milk is on average about 80 efficient although this varies widely ranging from 76 to as high as 94 thus during the first six months a woman typically produces an average of about three cups of milk a day so it takes an average of about 640 calories a day to meet the demand of producing milk how then is the gap between the recommendation and the actual need explained the generally recommended energy allowance of 500 calories assumes that the mother has laid down some energy reserves during her pregnancy anywhere from 15,400 to 23,000 calories worth it's expected that these fat stores will provide the caloric deficit from 100 to 150 calories a day for the first six months obviously women who were underweight during pregnancy or whose weight drops too much while they are nursing will need to raise their caloric intake to meet the increased demands q several years ago i purchased three copper pans all lined with nickel while cleaning up after a recent dinner party a friend inquired about the lining material when i told her it was nickel she expressed concern about its safety gently implying that unwittingly i might have been poisoning my guests are nickel-lined pans harmful in some way a no while both tin and nickel are used to line copper pans nickel offers two advantages 1 it is more durable and will outlast tin 2 it is more heat-resistant in practical terms that means that if an empty tin-lined pan is inadvertently left on a heated burner the lining will be destroyed rather quickly but a nickel lining will not be so easily hurt from a safety standpoint there really is no difference there is no evidence that either nickel or tin will migrate into the food in harmful amounts besides both metals are poorly absorbed and readily excreted
