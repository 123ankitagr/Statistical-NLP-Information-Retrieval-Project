germanys vaunted m3 the money supply indicator which the bundesbank unreservedly recommends to a monetarilyunified europe as the worlds trustiest monetary early warning system has once again fallen foul of special factors after ending 1993 at a peak with an annualised growth rate of 81 per cent more than 15 points above the top of its designated target range m3 attained a stratospheric 206 per cent in january almost 15 points off the mark the figure released yesterday coming on top of bad inflationary vibrations from the us and fears of rising interest rates had a dramatic effect on financial markets however bundesbank directors had already warned that 1994s early figures would be distorted furthermore they made their first cut in the securities repurchase rate since early december only one day before releasing the january m3 balloon it is safe to assume therefore that germanys policymakers attach little importance to the figure at least for the time being it is equally safe to assume economists agreed yesterday that the bundesbank will continue its softlysoftly progress on reducing interest rates this weeks 003 percentage point slice off the repo rate at which it supplies shortterm liquidity to the market was widely read as a signal that further reductions in shortterm rates are still on the cards the rate at which they come is a different matter the special factors which caused januarys inflation of m3 are understood still to be lingering liquidity parked in shortterm deposits in expectation of rising longterm rates and heavy borrowing by housebuyers concerned to preempt any interest rate rises so it could be some time before the reality of m3 coincides with the lines on the central banks graphic prognostications for the year this is not to say that the routine m3 figures offer observers an especially clear guide to the bundesbanks course of action the current ratecutting process started in september 1992 when m3 was above target and rising since then the shortterm discount lending rate has been cut eight times even though m3 has consistently exceeded its corridor range apart from the first three months of last year when a rush of funds overseas to avoid a new withholding tax caused a dip the reversal of that rush was one of the special factors contributing to januarys monetary surge a better guide and the one on which economists base much of their optimism is the west german inflation rate and the mediumterm outlook for prices allowing for a blip in january when new taxes and increased administered prices pushed the rate ahead monthonmonth inflation has been rising at around 02 per cent a month for the past year last month the annual rate was down to 33 per cent continuing a steady decline which has continued for more than 12 months prices of goods excluding services and administered prices rose just 23 per cent in the whole of last year significantly one state bavaria this week announced an overall annual inflation rate of 29 per cent the lowest for three years at the same time the federal statistics office reported a real 16 per cent fall in bluecollar gross earning the first cut since 1983 and a clear indicator of fading inflationary pressure from the demand side this was underlined yesterday by reports that retail sales last year fell a real 4 per cent with the retailers association expecting no improvement in 1994 despite disturbances caused by striking engineers and public sector workers confidence remains strong that the years pay rounds will end once again with real reductions in wages and salaries the bundesbank not given to extravagant optimism has repeatedly said it expects 2pointsomething inflation by the years end within striking distance of the 2 per cent it regards as price stability but it has other indicators in its sights while it has openly supported the governments view that pangerman economic growth of up to 15 per cent is attainable this year it also has to consider widespread opinions that the advance will be far smaller and will in any case rely almost totally on the continued revival of external demand for german goods and services this will depend partly on a steady feed of interest rate reductions to encourage recovery and maintain a dmark exchange rate at which german exports remain affordable considering this weeks turbulent market conditions the last thing expected from todays bundesbank council meeting is a resumption of interest rate reductions as several economists suggested the members might usefully spend the time assessing whether m3 is all it is cracked up to be or at least preparing a sound rationale for their claims that its rightful role is to be the guiding light of a future common european monetary policy
