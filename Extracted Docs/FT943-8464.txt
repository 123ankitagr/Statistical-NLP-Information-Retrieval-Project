the outline agreement between north korea and the us to defuse the mounting tension over pyongyangs nuclear programme is at one level a victory for quiet diplomacy north korea has agreed to suspend its provocative graphite reactor programme which is capable of producing weaponsgrade plutonium and to allow international inspection of its nuclear facilities in return it will receive less controversial western watercooled reactor technology and diplomatic links to the outside world the threat of a large scale north korean nuclear weapons programme which was real only a few weeks ago has thus receded on another level however the agreement is an attempt by the us to make the best of a pretty bad job washingtons options for pressing pyongyang to honour the nuclear nonproliferation treaty were extremely limited direct military action was probably unrealistic and certainly would have unsettled regional allies as well as provoking a sharp response from china and russia economic sanctions would have had little impact given north koreas near total isolation from international trade so instead of sticks the us has opted for carrots offering incentives such as funding of the new nuclear plant by its allies will buy the us some reassurance the halting of further plutonium reprocessing will stop the flow of potential bombmaking material while the examination of north korean sites will allow an audit of the plutonium produced so far yet at heart this is little more than containment of the problem without deeply intrusive inspections bound to raise north korean hackles there can be little certainty that some nuclear material does not remain hidden washington may be reluctant to push the verification issue to the degree required for absolute certainty lest the agreement reached so far collapse it may make the pragmatic decision that having found itself in a weak position the best it can hope for is the nearcertainty that the north korean nuclear capability remains small still even if pragmatic this stance does raise some difficult questions at the minimum the deal rewards bad behaviour by north korea at worst it shows the us giving in to nuclear blackmail other potential nuclear weapons states will doubtless have noted the sort of concessions which can be wrung from the us in return for giving up nuclear programmes first ukraine receives a large aid package in return for agreeing to return its nuclear warheads to russia now north korea collects for abandoning a nuclear programme of unknown effectiveness who might be next moreover other countries in the region from south korea to japan will be drawing their own lessons from the north korean experience not least concerning the need to deter such threats in future in the longer term the tension in the region remains if the value of the agreement is to stop a bad situation getting worse are there at least lessons which can be drawn to prevent a repetition of the problem one is that the nuclear nonproliferation treaty up for renewal next year badly needs strengthening the west should continue to honour the npts original offer to make it attractive for countries to renounce the bomb at the same time it should step up efforts to prevent the flow of critical technologies and nuclear fuels to rogue states tempted by nuclear weapons proliferation may be inevitable in the long term but the npt still has a valuable role to play in slowing its progress
