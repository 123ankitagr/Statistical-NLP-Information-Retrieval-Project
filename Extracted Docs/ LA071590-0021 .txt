TINTING , AS SOME of us may remember , was the process by which color was added to black-and-white photos before Eastman Kodak came up with Kodachrome film in 1935 . `` Tinting is a dying art , but it 's beginning to take hold again , '' says Marita Penner , who has been bringing new life to black-and-white photos . Whether it 's just the T-shirt or perhaps the tennis shoes in a photograph , Penner manages to put her paintbrush on the particular details that will make or break a photo . She shoots in old-fashioned black and white -- which , she explains , wo n't fade the way color photographs eventually will -- and then hand-tints a few highlights with photo oils . The result is a smashing art photo in old-fashioned color . Penner 's exhibit at arts-and-crafts fairs is a popular one , and a number of her shots are longtime big sellers . ( Her gallery-mounted , 11x14-inch photos in 16x20-inch frames sell for $ 75 each . ) Penner also makes house calls ; she will go to clients ' homes to shoot children 's portraits . For a $ 34 fee , plus traveling expenses , she provides one 8x10 photo , two 5x7s , three 3x5s and 12 wallet-size snapshots ( all but the wallet pictures bear her trademark tints ) .
