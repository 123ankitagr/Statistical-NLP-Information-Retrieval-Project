plus 685 prospective film buyers for the first time in the 10year history of the film market two soviet companies are vying for the attention of those buyers as well as american film makers interested in coventures also on hand from eastern europe film polski and czechoslovaklfex films from their respective suites situated at opposite ends of the hilton mosfilm and sovexportfilm are each hawking sovietmade titles that they believe have appeal for american and international moviegoers while here both companies also plan to do some buying of their own until this year the moscowbased sovexportfilm was the only soviet representative at the market a status that officially began in 1987 in 1986 sovexportfilm sent representatives to observe the proceedings founded more than 60 years ago sovexportfilm is the countrys biggest importerexporter of films until recently it was the countrys only such firm but in the spirit of perestroika and with lessening restrictions on foreigntrade activities there is now competition namely the powerful mosfilm the biggest studio in the soviet union mosfilm makes about 50 films a year roughly half the countrys film output plus about a dozen tv movies to sell their films both mosfilm and sovexportfilm are touting the newly liberated soviet cinema we have nudity smiles sovexportfilm public relations representative oleg m sulkin our film makers are now exploring narcotics prostitution and crime exclaims vladimir n dostal general director of mosfilm dostal also happens to serve as deputy chairman of the state committee on cinematography of the ussr also known as goskino an irony since goskino once kept tight control over the countrys film makers based in moscow goskino used to oversee the scripts from the countrys 15 republics censorship was common but as new freedoms have swept the country goskinos role has changed it now acts as more of a coordinator of various film activities today pornography remains prohibited but just about everything else seems to go judging from the promotional materials in the mosfilm and sovexportfilm suites a promotional trailer for sovexportfilms zero city a surrealistic social satire from soviet film maker karen shakhnazarov includes female frontal nudity and bizarre daliesque sights such as a sequence in which the main character sees an exact likeness of his head on a platter a knife then cuts into the head extracting a piece of it it has a cakelike texture and carefully placing it on a serving plate a company promotional catalogue which solemnly acknowledges russian classics available on videocassette such as battleship potemkin and october includes plenty of nudity to hype its contemporary product then theres the largeformat sovexportfilm calendar a giveaway to some lucky film market visitors which is a virtual pinup parade of soviet screen actresses this particular exercise in glasnost ranges from a california girlish anna tikhonova in blue jeans and jean jacket posing with posies to a shot of yelena sotnikova wearing a smile and some strategically draped 35millimeter film shes biting suggestively into an apple mosfilms most highly touted product the contemporary romantic tragicomedy black rose red rose is being hyped with promotional materials that include nude photos of an androgynous character known as homo sovieticus mosfilm

hero who united the tribes of siberia are currently studying english shooting is scheduled to begin late this year with a nod to the ofttroublesome translation and dubbing problems of soviettoenglish
