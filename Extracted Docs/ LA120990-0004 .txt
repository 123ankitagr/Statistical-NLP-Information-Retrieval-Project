Woman on the Beach ( AMC Sunday at 10 a.m. ) Jean Renoir 's last Hollywood movie is a moody thriller , about a deadly erotic triangle centering on a blind ex-painter .

The Naked Spur ( TMC Friday at 2 p.m. ) Perhaps the best of the top-notch Anthony Mann-Jimmy Stewart Western cycle : a picaresque thriller in which wily killer Robert Ryan amiably spreads dissension among the trio bringing him in for bounty . Movie Movie ( ABC Sunday Dec. 16 at 2 a.m. ) . Two delicious '30 's movie parodies , one on Busby-Berkeley style musicals , the other on `` Golden Boy '' -style fight pictures , by director Stanley Donen and writer Larry Gelbart .
