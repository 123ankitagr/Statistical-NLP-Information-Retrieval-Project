sir i am delighted that lex august 18 has reflected that 90 per cent of uk house owners are not burdened by negative equity and that fear of unemployment is the most influential factor for potential house buyers but i should point out that i as an intending first-time buyer am uninterested in the prospects for house price rises instead i am interested in when prices are likely to stop falling the difference may seem academic in the world of economic forecasting but in buying a house in which to live not to do up and sell as long as i do not pay more than necessary i do not care if house prices never rise again i don't think i am alone in this view inflation in house prices is as bad a curse as any other kind of inflation john williams 18 valley view jesmond newcastle upon tyne ne2 2 js
