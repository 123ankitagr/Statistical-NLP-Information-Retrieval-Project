Ground-breaking ceremonies Thursday set the stage for a Westside addition to a high-tech system that controls the flow of traffic through pavement sensors . The automated traffic system was one of a battery of traffic control measures used during the 1984 Olympics and is still in place in the Coliseum area . The system has also been installed downtown and in the West San Fernando Valley , and a citywide system should be in place within the next 10 years , city Transportation Department Manager Ed Rowe said . The system works through a series of pavement sensors that transmit information about traffic conditions to a control center in City Hall . Computers automatically modify the timing of signals to help traffic flow . The sensors also transmit information about traffic problems so officers or emergency response units can be quickly dispatched .
