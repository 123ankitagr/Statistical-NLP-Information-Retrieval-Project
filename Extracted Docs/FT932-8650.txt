Still on the subject of Earls , Observer doffs his hat to Peter Earl , the 38-year-old merchant banker who helped put Rebecca Stephens on top of the world yesterday . Until now Earl has been better known for organising some of the City 's more memorable takeover jaunts than for his extramural activities . However , as joint leader of the 40th anniversary Everest expedition he has set an example which other gung ho corporate finance types might want to ponder . His assistant tells me that Earl will be back at work at the headquarters of his Sloane Corporate Finance boutique first thing on Monday morning .
