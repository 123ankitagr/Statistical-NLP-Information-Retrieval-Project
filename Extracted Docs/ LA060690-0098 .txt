Pop superstar Michael Jackson remained hospitalized in stable condition Tuesday after renewed complaints of chest pains prompted his doctor to delay administering scheduled tests . The 31-year-old Grammy-winning singer was taken to St. John 's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica on Sunday evening after experiencing chest discomfort . His doctor said Jackson had a `` temporary setback '' Monday when he experienced more pain . On Tuesday , the entertainer rested comfortably in his hospital room while under the observation of his doctor , cardiologist Mark Zatzkis , said Bob Jones , Jackson 's publicist . The singer was expected to begin the testing process late Tuesday or today , Jones said . Before being hospitalized , Jackson had been rehearsing and following his normal routine of fasting , Jones said . Jones , who spoke to Jackson briefly Tuesday , said the singer seemed to be in good spirits . `` Mike is a positive person and his spirits are never low , '' Jones told reporters outside the hospital . However , the publicist added that Jackson has experienced a great deal of stress recently . He said the stress stems , in part , from the deaths of his grandmother and entertainer Sammy Davis Jr. , a close friend . In addition , Jackson is under pressure to finish an album that is eight months overdue , Jones said . Jackson began his musical career as the lead singer of the Jackson 5 , which produced numerous hits for Motown . The singer eventually went solo and , in 1979 , released `` Off the Wall , '' which sold 12 million copies . But it was the album `` Thriller , '' released in 1983 , that placed Jackson on the musical map . That work generated numerous Top 10 singles and Grammy awards and became the largest-selling album in the history of recorded music .
