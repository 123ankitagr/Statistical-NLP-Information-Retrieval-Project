a young man triumphantly slams a basketball through the hoop while a woman works out on the treadmill dozens of used running shoes are heaped in the corner and a golf player awaits his turn to try out his back swing on the astroturf this is not an exclusive health club but the research laboratories of reebok in stoughton massachusetts for reebok as for other high-tech sports shoe makers such as adidas nike la gear and new balance recreation is big business the basketball player is stepping on a sensitive force plate a device beneath the boards that measures the force of the player's landing after his jump the woman on the treadmill is wearing reflectors on strategic parts of her legs and feet the action is recorded on high-speed video the reflectors movements are then isolated and fed into a computer where they will be studied in detail the heaps of running shoes will be inspected to determine how well they held up over miles of use and the golf player will eventually be converted into a computer stick figure so that scientists can study the movement of his foot during the back swing technology in the sports shoe industry has come a long way in the last 20 years in the 1960 s most people expected no more from a sports shoe than a little foam and rubber with canvas or leather on top the running craze of the 1970 s sparked the first interest in shoes tailored to a specific sport since then the sector has blossomed companies have tapped research in the aerospace and transport industries to make improvements in design shoelaces have been replaced on many models by a less complicated strap system sports shoes are pumped up with air reinforced with high-tech materials sculptured to the foot and manipulated to eliminate excess weight consumers have responded enthusiastically the global wholesale athletic footwear industry reached dollars 12.1 bn pounds 7.3 bn in 1993, according to the npd group a market research firm for 1994, the figure is forecast to be even higher manufacturers are always looking for new sports to add to their product line the recent enthusiasm for mountain biking inspired a crusade for the perfect mountain-biking shoe adidas is considering developing a shoe for snowboarding a sport which has taken off in the us and new balance just arrived on the market with a new boat shoe an alternative to moccasins companies are also trying to expand their market by making shoes for sports more commonly played in europe and asia than in the us nike for instance will introduce a new line next year that includes footgear for squash handball volleyball cricket and rugby hiking boots are also attracting attention and for good reason while a tennis shoe for instance rarely sells for more than dollars 120 a pair hiking boots are often dollars 200 or more there is also much room for improvement most hiking boots are unnecessarily uncomfortable according to spencer white head of research at reebok because every sport involves different foot movements manufacturers say athletic shoes need to be tailored for a specific use games such as handball or tennis for instance require a great deal of lateral side-to-side movement requiring a more stable shoe than one worn by walkers soccer players like a shoe that fits like a glove and used to buy footwear too small before manufacturers latched on american football players need good traction however if the shoe gets stuck on a twisting movement they can hurt their knees reebok is trying to design a shoe that would offer both forward and lateral traction but would still give way on a twisting motion even within one sport athletes needs may vary a dribbler or defence player in basketball for instance needs to move fast and usually prefers a lighter shoe but offensive players are normally bigger and heavier and require more stability in the heel for jumping everything is important from the form on which the shoe is built to the heel width to the tread pattern says edith harmon product development manager for new balance besides laboratory testing manufacturers rely on top athletes and testers often referred to as the weekend warriors for input the big athletes are important but we get even more feedback from people who play sports casually says guy marshall a footwear designer for adidas one of the main challenges in the industry is to design a shoe that is both light and strong we are looking to take every last gramme of material out while maintaining the shoe's stability says harmon the right materials are of prime importance footwear manufacturers were met with surprise when they showed up at aerospace and transport fairs in the 1980 s now they have formed direct contacts with chemical firms and other materials developers nike for example uses a du pont concoction called kevlar for its tennis shoe line one of the main problems in a tennis shoe is getting durability in the forefoot because players tend to drag their toes says richard oldfield product line manager for the group kevlar added strength to the shoe without introducing heaviness the material was used in bullet-proof vests and for brake pads on logging lorries before nike took it up makers of running shoes which need to be especially lightweight started experimenting with mesh materials in the 1980 s now meshes are everywhere nike also uses a material called ultralam used in windsails for windsurfing for its cross-country training shoes it is light-weight thin and strong and we apply it in areas needing extra support says oldfield one of reebok's latest products the instapump fury makes good use of high-tech materials to achieve a lighter weight the company's studies revealed just how little pressure most runners place on the arch of their foot the manufacturer's response was to eliminate the central section concentrating material in the forefoot and heel the result looks like a cross between a high-heel hiking boot and an alien's idea of walking shoes the foot is given support in the arch through an incredibly thin lightweight and strong material called graphlite the material originally used in the wings of aeroplanes runs glass fibres one way and carbon fibres the other and is covered with a plastic resin the three materials together are much stronger than they would be separately says white to try to eliminate stress and injury new balance uses former transport industry shock absorbers that were once used as a replacement for a heavy steel spring it also manufactures long-distance running gear with high-wearing abrasion-resistant rubber one of the most important innovations in recent years has been air tubes nike and adidas use air chambers in shoe soles for lightweight stability reebok uses inflatable uppers for a snugger fit it is uncertain how far the industry can take its fascination with high technology marshall says the last significant innovation was the air pump we are waiting for something really big like that to take the industry forward again fashion of course will play a part in the industry's future but manufacturers say it is not their mainstay a lot of people who buy these shoes may never practise the sport says white they just want to wear something that looks cool we love these people but we can't survive just with their purchases we need athletes who buy the shoes because of their superior performance and that is where the high technology comes in
