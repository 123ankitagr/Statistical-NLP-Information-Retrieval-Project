The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival opens today for two weeks at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas . Here is today 's schedule : 'The Yen Family ' Japan , 1988 , 113 minutes 8:25 p.m. Yojiro Takita 's hilarious satire on a suburban family so money-grubbing that it runs a newspaper distributorship and a catering service -- both exploiting the elderly -- right out of the kitchen ( where the mother is also operating her erotic wake-up service while she prepares breakfast ) . As the film becomes increasingly outrageous it develops considerable complexity , and its indictment of materialism , Japanese-style , is often ironic and paradoxical . Like Takita 's earlier `` Comic Magazine , '' a corrosive satire on the excesses of the media , `` The Yen Family '' is a swift , satisfying treat . RECOMMENDED KEVIN THOMAS
