both germany's main political parties could end up the losers from an extraordinary legal decision to order a new state election in the city of hamburg the second smallest of the country's 16 lander the move ordered by the constitutional court in the city because of an undemocratic selection process of candidates for chancellor helmut kohl's christian democratic union means a re-run of the poll held in 1991 it is the first time a state election has had to be repeated since the foundation of the federal republic yet in spite of the blame lying clearly at the door of the cdu the biggest losers could be the social democrats the 1991 election in hamburg germany's second largest city after berlin was won by the spd with an absolute majority of just one seat but it could now face serious defections because of the disarray of the party at national level although the spd welcomed the decision yesterday it is in chaos following the resignation on monday of its leader mr bjorn engholm and a rapid outbreak of infighting over the succession an immediate opinion poll in the city showed the social democrats gaining just 40 per cent of the votes compared with 48 per cent in 1991 the cdu however is also lagging in popularity nationally thanks to the sharp economic recession and the high costs of german unification the fact that the city party has been found guilty of undemocratic procedures in its own candidate selection seems likely to lose it further support the same opinion poll carried out by the dortmund-based forsa institute puts the cdu on 34 per cent one point down on 1991 the new election therefore opens the way for widespread protest voting against the main political establishment with probable gains for fringe parties such as the greens and the extreme right-wing republicans or deutsche volksunion dvu a large proportion of non-voters is also to be expected given the circumstances of the election the greens were supported by 16 per cent of voters polled yesterday compared with just 7.2 per cent in 1991, while non-voters showed an increase from 35 to 39 per cent the court decision is a serious embarrassment for mr kohl's cdu which was accused of not allowing minority groups to propose alternative candidates to the party list put forward by the leadership the party failed to observe the inner-party democracy required by the constitution it said however the spd is in no position to exploit its position campaigns are gaining momentum for a whole variety of candidates for the national party leadership the front runner is mr gerhard schroder the current premier of lower saxony but he also faces strong opposition for apparent disloyalty to mr engholm
