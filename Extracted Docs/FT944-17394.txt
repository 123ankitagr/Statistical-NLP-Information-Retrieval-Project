the british labour party conference was not the only place where people were arguing furiously this week about private versus public ownership the international meeting on human genes in washington dc was equally divided by debate over whether genetic information should be freely available in the public domain or the private property of the researchers who patent it first each side claims that its favoured system will accelerate the application of genetic discoveries to human health in the form of treatments and diagnostic tests for diseases from cancer to mental illness arguments over gene ownership have bedevilled biotechnology and medical research for several years they are now reaching a new intensity as scientists realise how much the private sector is coming to dominate the race to discover the 100,000 genes which control human development and susceptibility to disease the biomedical research leaders who launched the grandiose human genome project in the late 1980 s as a pounds 2 bn international effort to decode all dna the chemical store of genetic information expected it to take about 15 years and to be funded largely by governments in fact biotechnology companies in partnership with the established pharmaceutical industry are spending more on genetics research than the traditional public bodies such as the us national institutes of health and the uk medical research council and by taking scientific short cuts they are producing results more quickly however the debate is not simply between academic and industrial researchers within each group opinions are divided on the merits of patenting genes as two of the world's largest drugs companies merck and smithkline beecham showed this week when they announced diametrically opposed policies on the issue merck said it would establish a comprehensive database of genetic information to which everyone including commercial competitors will have open access the company will provide several million dollars for washington university in st louis one of the top us genetics labs to create new data for the so-called merck gene index this will facilitate progress in biomedical research by reducing duplication of effort speeding the identification of disease-related genes and enhancing the probability of breakthrough drug discoveries says dr edward scolnick merck's head of research although the company's announcement was couched in terms of self-congratulatory altruism some competitors saw it as more of a spoiling move to make up for the fact that merck had been slow to appreciate that genetic discoveries could transform pharmaceutical research on the other hand smithkline beecham until recently one of the sleepier pharmaceutical giants has moved astonishingly quickly to feed genetic information into its mainstream research since linking up with human genome sciences the leading biotech company specialising in gene discovery in may 1993 sb is paying hgs dollars 125 m over 10 years for an equity stake and exclusive access to its private database which already contains partial or complete dna sequences of about one-third of all human genes the key to hgs's success is a short-cut called cdna complementary dna sequencing this fishes out from particular body tissues eg the brain pieces of dna corresponding to genes that are active there it gives a library of gene fragments written in the four letters of the genetic code c a t g rather like an index of first lines in a poetry book most sequences are distinctive enough for scientists to understand their meaning in washington this week sb and hgs made clear that they had no intention of allowing others unrestricted access to the database which they believe gives them a huge competitive advantage for future product development at the same time they revealed the terms under which academic researchers would be allowed to use the database the main condition is that hgs will have first rights to exploit any patentable discovery they make the conditions that govern access to these data should preserve the incentive for the private sector to invest the funds necessary to bring new drugs and diagnostic products to the market says dr william haseltine hgs chief executive unalloyed dumping of genetic information into the public sector is not in the best interests of the public dr michael morgan of the london-based wellcome trust the world's largest medical research charity brought together all interested parties in a fringe meeting at this week's washington conference to try to work out a consensus for future action the hgs sb proposal may well be acceptable to academia though we shall have to study the terms carefully dr morgan says but they are not giving access to the pharmaceutical industry so there is enormous support from the other drug companies for a public domain database dr morgan says his meeting agreed that merck's proposal should form the basis of an international effort to identify as many individual genes as possible and map the position of each gene on one of the 23 chromosomes that carry all human dna the mapping stage is essential for understanding how the genes work glaxo the largest uk drug company would be happy to join in too says dr barry ross research director if this can be developed into a full partnership between industry and academia rather than something run by merck with the merck name on it everyone involved in genetics research agrees that patent protection is needed at some stage to provide the financial incentive for companies to turn the science into products the contentious question really is at what point in the r d process should patents take effect to end the sharing of public information and stimulate product development sb hgs and other biotechnology companies whose competitive advantage is in creating genetic information want patents to take effect as early as possible merck glaxo and other large drug companies believe that patents should not operate until you have a gene-based product to protect as dr ross puts it academics views depend mostly on whether they are involved with biotech companies seeking to exploit genetic information last month's decision by the university of utah and myriad genetics a us biotech company to patent their discovery of a gene causing breast cancer provoked a hostile reaction from researchers who said it would destroy future collaboration in the search for cancer genes overshadowing the debate is confusion about the way patent law applies to genetic discoveries rulings by the us patent office and its european counterparts have been contradictory and not yet tested in court it will not be known for many years what level of genetic information can be protected will it be a fragment of a gene the full human gene or the gene incorporated into a potential product wherever the line is eventually drawn it is already clear that the old academic ideal of open scientific collaboration unmotivated by commercial gain is as out of date as the labour party's clause 4
