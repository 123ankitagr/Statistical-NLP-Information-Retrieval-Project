the british labour party conference place people arguing furiously week private versus public ownership the international meeting human genes washington dc equally divided debate whether genetic information freely available public domain private property researchers patent first each side claims favoured system accelerate application genetic discoveries human health form treatments diagnostic tests diseases cancer mental illness arguments gene ownership bedevilled biotechnology medical research several years they reaching new intensity scientists realise much private sector coming dominate race discover 100000 genes control human development susceptibility disease the biomedical research leaders launched grandiose human genome project late 1980s pounds 2bn international effort decode dna chemical store genetic information expected take 15 years funded largely governments in fact biotechnology companies partnership established pharmaceutical industry spending genetics research traditional public bodies us national institutes health uk medical research council taking scientific short cuts producing results quickly however debate simply academic industrial researchers within group opinions divided merits patenting genes two worlds largest drugs companies merck smithkline beecham showed week announced diametrically opposed policies issue merck said would establish comprehensive database genetic information everyone including commercial competitors open access the company provide several million dollars washington university st louis one top us genetics labs create new data socalled merck gene index this facilitate progress biomedical research reducing duplication effort speeding identification diseaserelated genes enhancing probability breakthrough drug discoveries says dr edward scolnick mercks head research although companys announcement couched terms selfcongratulatory altruism competitors saw spoiling move make fact merck slow appreciate genetic discoveries could transform pharmaceutical research on hand smithkline beecham recently one sleepier pharmaceutical giants moved astonishingly quickly feed genetic information mainstream research since linking human genome sciences leading biotech company specialising gene discovery may 1993 sb paying hgs dollars 125m 10 years equity stake exclusive access private database already contains
