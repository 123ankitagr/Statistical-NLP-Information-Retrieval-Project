BRITAIN 'S latest Pounds 650m Trident missile submarine lost a crucial part of its defensive sonar equipment during sea trials , MPs were told yesterday , David White writes . The Commons defence committee also heard that delays in the command system software meant the submarine could not fire torpedoes . But it was told the system , designed by BAeSema , a joint venture between British Aerospace and the Anglo-French Sema group , would be ready by the time the vessel was deployed . HMS Vanguard , the first of four Trident submarines , is due to enter service in late 1994 or early 1995 . Rear Admiral Richard Irwin , chief of the strategic systems executive , said part of the sonar 'towed array ' trailing from the stern of the submarine broke away in the early stages of contractor sea trials , between October and January . The towed array , costing about Pounds 250,000 , is part of the Sonar 2054 system provided by GEC-Marconi .
