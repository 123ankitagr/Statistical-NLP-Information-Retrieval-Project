The number of companies failing during the first half of the year fell 15 per cent compared with the first six months of last year , Dun & Bradstreet , the business-information group , said yesterday . In the period 21,887 businesses in England and Wales entered liquidation or receivership which did not lead to the rescue of the company . The number of failures in Scotland over the same period fell 77 per cent to 1,529 , which Dun & Bradstreet said reflected changes to Scottish bankruptcy regulations .
