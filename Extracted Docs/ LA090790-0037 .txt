China welcomed a surprise visit Thursday by Iraq 's Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan and hinted that it might send food and medicine to Baghdad . `` The ( U.N. ) resolution . . . clearly stipulates that the embargo against Iraq does not include supplies intended strictly for medical purposes and foodstuffs in humanitarian circumstances , '' spokeswoman Li Jinhua told a news conference . `` And I agree that this point should also be strictly implemented , '' she added . President Saddam Hussein said Wednesday that Iraqi children are endangered because the embargo has deprived them of food , milk and medicine . A U.S.-dominated military presence enforcing the economic blockade has choked off Iraq 's oil exports and squeezed its supplies of imported food and medicine . There are more than 5,000 Chinese citizens in Iraq . Beijing has not announced any plans to withdraw them . India told the United Nations on Wednesday that it wants to send food and medicine to Iraq and Kuwait on humanitarian grounds . The Chinese spokeswoman said Ramadan had come to Beijing at Baghdad 's request to discuss the gulf crisis . Diplomats said that Ramadan , who headed a 30-man delegation , would probably meet Vice Premier Wu Xueqian and try to dissuade China from moving closer to the tough stance adopted by Western powers in the gulf . China has supported Security Council resolutions on the gulf but has taken a softer line than other permanent members -- the United States , Britain , France and the Soviet Union . It has called for an Arab solution and condemned possible use of force by the big powers as risking all-out war .
