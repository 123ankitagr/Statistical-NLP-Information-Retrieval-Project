Nelson Mandela , the African National Congress leader , will have made no friends for himself in South Africa 's townships with his announcement this week that he wants to appoint Lee Kuan Yew as an economic adviser to the ANC . Singapore 's former prime minister , now on a visit to the country , would find few kindred spirits among the ANC 's other economic advisers , many of whom are Marxists - not to mention in the townships where the 'workers' still expect to inherit the earth with the help of the ANC . The choice reveals Mandela at his pragmatic best . He says openly that the state of the South African economy , in its fourth year of recession , frightens him silly . If it takes Lee Kuan Yew to get growth back on track , so be it .
