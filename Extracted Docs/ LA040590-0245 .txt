cancer and carcinoma of the joints in one hand she just kept becoming greater and greater as the years went on times jazz critic leonard feather a longtime friend of miss vaughan said wednesday in the last few years she was just astonishing she was the idol and envy of virtually all singers feather appraised her professional versatility in his encyclopedia of jazz singers by saying that she was capable of incomparable jazz performances yet qualified to be an opera singer that opinion was echoed wednesday by times music critic martin bernheimer who reviews performances of classical music including opera sarah vaughan had a voice of extraordinary sweetness flexibility and purity and she used it with uncanny insinuation throughout a wide range she could have taught many an opera diva lessons in breath control in legato phrasing and in expressive communication she was a great singer period now that sassy is gone said miss vaughan's longtime friend comedian bill cosby there is no one to measure great singers by miss vaughan who recorded popular and standard songs as well as jazz classics had scoffed at attempts by fans and music critics to categorize her as a jazz singer i just sing she said i sing whatever i can born march 27, 1924, in newark n j to a carpenter and a laundress she received her musical training in the church choir with her mother first as a singer and later as organist she claimed she never envisioned getting into show business even when on a friend's dare she signed up for amateur night at new york's storied apollo theater in 1942 i just quit in the third year of high school and started singing at amateur hours she once told an interviewer the night i won at the apollo i was only doing it for the 10 but billy eckstine heard her that night and recommended her to band leader earl fatha hines who hired her her career as a concert and recording star was launched feather who was present at the apollo when miss vaughan first opened there with hines band april 23, 1943, wrote of her in his jazz encyclopedia sarah vaughan's voice completely different from that of billie holiday ella fitzgerald or any of the other great jazz stylists before her brought to jazz an unprecedented combination of attractive characteristics a rich beautifully controlled tone and vibrato an ear for the chord structure of songs enabling her to change or inflect the melody as an instrumentalist might a coy sometimes archly naive quality alternating with a sense of great sophistication fitzgerald herself once called miss vaughan the greatest singing talent in the world today miss vaughan's remarkable range with the husky voice made huskier over the years by her smoking was so extraordinary that it often prompted exaggeration they say four octaves but it's not true she said modestly in a 1986 interview two octaves and a fifth maybe maybe a little more her voice was considered more instrumental than vocal and was often likened to a horn a comparison she found logical i don't think i ever modeled myself after a singer she said i've more or less copied the styles of horn-tooters right from the start miss vaughan did admit to some influence by singer marian anderson the prize for one of the amateur contests she won as a teen-ager was a choice between roller skates or a ticket to a marian anderson concert she chose the concert and said she fell in love with the sound of her voice after her debut with hines miss vaughan toured with his band for a year working with dizzy gillespie and charlie parker and trying to imitate their trumpet and saxophone when eckstine formed his own band in 1944, he hired miss vaughan and backed her in her first recording i'll wait and pray feather a jazz musician as well as critic received a demonstration record of miss vaughan's singing from gillespie and arranged for her to record under her own name with continental she sang four songs for 20 each with feather playing the piano accompaniment miss vaughan first won a national following with her recording of lover man made with gillespie her early career which she dismissed in interviews as paying a lot of dues included concerts in tobacco warehouses and barns in the south as well as modestly successful records and a few appearances in places like new york's copacabana in the 1940 s it wasn't until the early 1950 s that sassy began singing in the better spots and collected a following like at birdland in new york and the blue note in chicago where dave garroway heard her called her the divine one and promoted her on radio and tv john malachi an early accompanist who nicknamed her sassy recalled in an interview a few years ago by the 1970 s she had a strong international following and won downbeat's international critics poll for best female singer in the world six times 1973 and 1975-79 she sang with major symphony orchestras and for heads of state and in prestigious places like carnegie hall as recently as last year her concert performances prompted a reviewer to write that she continues to cause excitement wherever she appears thank god said levy wednesday we have her recordings to preserve her greatness she was one
