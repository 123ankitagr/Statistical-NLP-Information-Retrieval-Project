the bundesbank yesterday set a tight monetary target for next year and warned industry trade unions and the federal and state governments against following policies that could push up inflation mr hans tietmeyer president of the german central bank gave no hint of future interest policy but some economists said the money-supply goal for 1995 could only be achieved if interest rates rose the bundesbank will be forced to act said mr adolf rosenstock frankfurt-based economist at industrial bank of japan the bank set its target range for m3 the broad monetary aggregate at between 4 and 6 per cent this is unchanged from 1994, but because of the way the rate is calculated on an annualised basis from fourth quarter to fourth quarter it implies a much lower average growth rate of 3.5 per cent after this year's 9 per cent thus said salomon brothers the us investment bank the bundesbank likely will have to tighten interest rate policy markedly in the course of the year it said monetary tightening would be appropriate because of expected higher wage rises rising import prices and price pressures at the producer level official figures yesterday showed a rise of 0.4 per cent in west german producer prices in november over october the bundesbank said its monetary policies in 1995 would be aimed at dampening price growth further and creating monetary conditions for lasting economic growth it reaffirmed its commitment to m3 as its main policy yardstick despite the extreme growth rates experienced earlier this year to encourage funds to move out of short-term deposits included in m3 into longer-term investments the bundesbank cut interest rates earlier this year sine may the discount and lombard rates have been unchanged at 4.5 and 6 per cent respectively with an annualised growth rate in m3 of 6 per cent in november the bundesbank's money-supply target is now being met however the trend has been helped by the introduction of money-market funds into germany if these were included in m3 the november rate would have been 6.9 per cent the bundesbank will improve its monitoring of monetary trends by including these funds into expanded m3 which also includes traditional m3 cash short and medium-term deposits and savings and deposits in foreign branches of german banks the m3 target range allows for potential economic growth of 2.75 per cent and inflation of 2 per cent the bundesbank's medium-term goal with 1 per cent to allow for a slowdown in the velocity of money in circulation mr tietmeyer said money supply was more than adequate after this year's strong increase he said the bank's anti-inflationary stance needed government support in reining back spending and from wage negotiators in reaching moderate settlements he warned companies contemplating high price rises that the monetary conditions will not be created for this although the bundesbank's inflation goal was 2 per cent he said he would like to see the rate lower see lex
