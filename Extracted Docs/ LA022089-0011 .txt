last oct 4, jesus mendez was so ill that he had to stop working at a san diego radiator repair shop he had been sick off and on for four years but he did not know why despite being treated by several doctors after a social worker suggested that his poor health might be work-related a lawyer sent him for a blood test it turned out that mendez had become a victim of an ailment known since before the birth of christ lead poisoning four months after he stopped working mendez still has unsafe levels of lead in his blood there is no telling when he will be able to return to work mendez 36, said he is depressed and constantly aware of his lead poisoning every morning when i get up i have the taste of lead in my mouth he said in an interview by the time morning is through it feels as if my head is going to explode mendez's situation is all too common more than a decade after the federal government enacted regulations restricting workers exposure to lead significant numbers of employees continue to be afflicted with lead poisoning creating serious short-term and long-term health problems according to recent studies obtained by the times over 9,000 reports of high blood lead levels have been received by the california department of health services in the past two years said dr linda rudolph director of the department's occupational health surveillance and evaluation program who just completed one study rudolph said that more than 90 of the reports involved workers employed in hazardous industries with well-known lead exposures these work sites included battery manufacturing plants lead smelters brass foundries gun firing ranges radiator repair shops and construction according to reports provided to the health department by medical laboratories many reports identified workers who were seriously ill or had been hospitalized for treatment of lead poisoning rudolph said she said 800 workers had enough lead in their blood that serious health problems could result there were multiple reports on many workers she said lead poisoning can cause kidney damage injury to the central and peripheral nervous system and even brain damage in particularly aggravated cases lead exposure before or during pregnancy may increase the chance of miscarriage rudolph said that 46 of the affected workers in the california study were latino and that 78 of those afflicted were in los angeles county the study she said represents just the tip of the iceberg because many workers are not tested as is required in some situations safety factors preliminary results of another study done by rudolph and other doctors showed that only 2.6 of california facilities using lead had done environmental monitoring air testing and only 1.4 had routine blood testing of workers this means that nearly 205,000 california workers with potential lead exposure toiled in facilities where no air testing of lead levels has been done she said john froines who recently headed a study at ucla that reviewed 14,000 air samples taken by occupational safety and health administration osha inspectors from 1979 to 1985, said the problems described by rudolph are not limited to california i think there is an epidemic of lead poisoning going on in the united states said froines associate professor of industrial hygiene and toxicology at ucla he said he reached this conclusion based on the ucla research the california study and one recently done in new york state there is no central repository of data on the number of workers nationally afflicted with lead poisoning there have been some improvements in the level of exposure in certain important industries but the scope and severity of lead exposure is greater than osha envisaged when the lead standard was promulgated in 1978, said froines who wrote the federal lead standard at osha during jimmy carter's presidency froines said the problem is particularly disturbing because the dangers of lead exposures have been known for so long i think what we're seeing with lead is a microcosm of what's happening with occupational health rudolph said despite some progress we're seeing large segments of the worker community not benefiting from the work that has been done in the last couple of decades lead poisoning is preventable she said in fact she added the u s public health service has set a goal of completely ending occupational lead poisoning by 1990 we are a long way from reaching that goal cleanup legislation last monday state sen art torres d-los angeles chairman of the senate toxics and public safety management committee introduced legislation designed to eliminate occupational lead poisoning in california by 1991 the bill would require the department of health services by july 1, 1990, to establish and maintain an occupational lead poisoning prevention program the federal government took a major initiative in 1978 when osha announced broad new rules to protect workers from lead poisoning at the time the agency said nearly a million american workers were exposed to excessive lead levels on the job and that about 100,000 of them were suffering from some illness directly attributable to those exposures the new rules required companies over a one to 10-year period to reduce permissible exposure levels from 200 micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air to 50 micrograms the osha lead standard also requires blood testing of employees working in an area where air samples show 30 or more micrograms of lead per cubic meter of air if any test reveals the presence of 60 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood or three consecutive tests show an average of 50 micrograms a worker must be removed from the job the worker can return to the job only if two consecutive tests show that the level is under 40 an unusual provision of the standard protects a worker removed from his job because of a high lead level against loss of pay seniority or other job rights robert putnam a consultant to the lead industries assn said most companies had come into compliance with federal standards he said that if there were problems they generally would be found at small companies dr philip landrigan an occupational medicine specialist at mt sinai school of medicine in new york said there has been significant reduction in lead exposures in some industries particularly battery manufacturing however landrigan and others said that workers in some industries particularly brass foundries radiator repair and construction the latter of which is specifically exempted from the osha standard are exposed to dangerous levels of lead landrigan also said recent research showed workers could be endangered by amounts of lead in the blood smaller than had been believed in 1978 when the osha standard was enacted he said three scientific studies showed that a significant number of children born to women who had 20 micrograms or more of lead in their blood while pregnant had a negative effect on the children's intelligence twenty micrograms is well below the current standard he said in recent years osha has issued a number of citations against companies violating the lead standard agency officials said for example last october osha fined federated metals of paramount 202,900 for repeatedly exposing workers to dangerously high levels of lead at the time frank strasheim osha's regional administrator in san francisco said the federated case was part of a disturbing wider pattern of lead problems in california i'm surprised at the severity of the lead-exposure cases we are finding in california especially in the long-established firms strasheim said issue of inspectors rudolph froines and other occupational safety experts asserted that osha had too few inspectors to be effective on lead problems dr james g dahlgren a los angeles physician who has treated many victims of lead poisoning said the only hope for many workers was having an aggressive union health and safety representative monitoring conditions in the workplace dahlgren and rudolph also noted that the federal lead standard does not apply to companies with fewer than 10 workers rudolph said many small companies are endangering workers in some instances perhaps unknowingly many los angeles county companies told health department researchers that they were not aware of their obligations under the lead standard and fewer than 20 of 300 firms contacted had done any air monitoring said dr paul papanek chief of the los angeles county health department's toxics epidemiology program papanek recounted one horror story of a worker he had treated while in private practice with dahlgren the man had been heavily exposed to lead while working in a los angeles battery factory on five occasions in 1982, the lead in his blood was double the allowable limit and he had to be hospitalized papanek said the man should have been removed from his job by a company physician long before he was papanek said because his overexposures had permanent consequences he can't remember his kids birth dates papanek said of the man's condition today he has great trouble with memory his wife won't let him drive he's brain-damaged he's not going to get better dr ira monosson of santa monica an occupational medicine specialist said his patient mendez is regrettably typical of the way workers develop serious lead problems mendez worked as a welder in his native mexico from 1967 to 1978 in 1979, he went to work at a small radiator repair shop in san diego according to his medical records and in an interview mendez said that he worked six days a week repairing radiators in 1984, he began to experience fatigue insomnia loss of appetite and nausea and abdominal pains he went to a doctor who diagnosed his problem as an ulcer over the next four years his symptoms grew worse the fatigue intensified he was often irritable experienced numbness and tingling in one arm had severe headaches and trouble remembering things mendez saw several doctors but he was never tested for lead in his blood it was really ridiculous monosson said too many doctors don't know to ask people what they do for a living medical schools are terribly remiss he asserted used lead in work mendez and his two co-workers typically repaired eight to 10 radiators a day according to his medical records he used lead and lead byproducts most of his day in soldering and welding mendez said that during his nine years at the radiator shop he used a respirator mask for only 15 days in 1985 it got dirty and the owner never replaced it mendez said so we didn't use them monosson said it may take a long time for mendez's blood lead level to get down to normal because of the amount of the metal that accumulated in his body over many years of exposure mendez's lawyer mariaelena davila called his case a terrible tragedy she currently is involved in a battle over supplemental income benefits that his client is supposed to be receiving
