Bone marrow transplants are helping treat some women with advanced stages of breast cancer , researchers from the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore reported at the recent San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas . An estimated 140,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year . About 30 % of these patients have a recurrence of the disease in other organs , such as the liver , the brain and the lungs . At present , there is no effective treatment for advanced breast cancer . But an autologous bone marrow transplant -- in which a portion of the patient 's own bone marrow is removed , treated chemically to kill cancer cells and reimplanted -- could help some of these women . With their highly sensitive bone marrow removed , the patients are better able to tolerate higher doses of cancer-killing drugs , which are then more effective at knocking out the cancer . Since 1987 , oncologist Nancy Davidson and her colleagues have performed this procedure on 20 patients with advanced breast cancer . Nine patients have responded completely ; 11 showed partial responses during nine months of follow-up after the treatment . About a dozen centers are using the marrow transplants to battle advanced breast cancer at a cost of $ 75,000 to $ 100,000 per patient .
