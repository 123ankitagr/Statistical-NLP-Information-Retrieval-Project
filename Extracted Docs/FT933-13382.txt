president bill clinton yesterday dismissed mr william sessions as director of the federal bureau of investigation finally despairing of persuading the embattled former judge to resign grace-fully we cannot have a leadership vacuum at an agency as important to the united states as the fbi mr clinton said at a news conference yesterday after a meeting with ms janet reno the attorney general at which he had decided to fire mr sessions mr clinton said he would name a new director today in the meantime he had asked mr floyd clarke the fbi's deputy director and mr sessions principal foe within the agency to serve as acting director mr louis freeh a former fbi agent and federal prosecutor who is currently a judge in new york is expected to be nominated for the fbi directorship mr sessions has served little more than half of his statutory 10-year term at the head of the principal us federal police force his ability to lead the fbi has been considerably impaired since a january report by the justice department accused him of ethical violations including the misuse of fbi cars aircraft and employees for personal ends mrs alice sessions complained on sunday that her husband was the victim of a campaign by a group of old fbi hands who objected to his efforts to bring some racial and gender diversity to the largely white male agency mr clinton acknowledged yesterday that mr sessions had performed a considerable service in broadening the look of the fbi but said that he agreed fully with ms reno's judgment that he was no longer capable of leading the fbi he said one of the reasons he had taken so long before dismissing him was his belief that the fbi should not be politicised and that a change of president should not be sufficient reason for changing the director
