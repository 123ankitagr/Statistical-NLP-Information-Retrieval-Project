on almost any given weekend morning the regulars show up at a van nuys elementary school for a pickup game you can count on keith weinstein and the grant high players to show up and just as regularly harry marks and robert hill from archrival north hollywood show up too except this past weekend because it wasnt just any given weekend they didnt show up this weekend weinstein said they are the north hollywood players and the huskies should be forgiven they had seen enough of weinstein raining threepoint shots they had seen enough of him stealing the ball they had seen enough of him just plain beating them so why go through it again on a day off yes 5foot10 shooting guard keith weinstein had a day to remember last wednesday when grant upset north hollywood for the second time this season last month in the north hollywood tournament grant beat the huskies 5443 this time the score was 4846 and it sent north hollywood to its only other loss of the season what role did weinstein play the senior scored 25 points more than half of his teams total on nineof15 shooting from the field he made five threepoint shots had four steals and handed out a couple of assists more importantly he proved to be the coolest of players in an important game time and again down the stretch the lancers looked to weinstein time and again he answered i feel like i can do it at the end weinstein said simply with grant leading 3533 and time running out in the third quarter weinstein scored on a buzzerbeating jump shot to make the score 3733 with the score tied 3737 and just 603 left weinstein launched an nbadistance threepoint shot and was fouled the shot hit only net as did his free throw giving grant a 4137 lead then as grant trailed 4443 with less than a minute remaining weinstein picked up a loose ball streaked down the court made a layup and was fouled setting off bedlam in the gymnasium he made the ensuing free throw and grant led 4644 hes our most valuable player grant coach howard levine said he has been all along weinstein scored nine of the teams final 13 points almost more crucial to him and his mates though was winning a little respect every time we play north hollywood its something special weinstein said because last time we beat them not many people thought that it was for real they have to believe now weinstein followed his performance in the north hollywood game by scoring a teamhigh 17 points in just three quarters on friday during a routine win over poly on sevenof15 shooting he made three threepoint shots and handed out six assists weinstein has made 27 of his past 50 shots from the field including 11 threepoint shots in grants past four games all wins but like a true disciple of the disciplined levine he switches to teamoriented discussion we have to play hard in every game or else he said we try really hard were not at all a cocky team were kinda like a humble team on an individual note though weinstein said that he has received a few letters from division ii schools but likely will attend a junior college next fall
