Marc Bohan , the former designer for Christian Dior , is expected to take over as artistic director of the fashion house of Norman Hartnell , dressmakers to two generations of British royalty . If the Bohan appointment is sealed , as expected , he will become the first major French designer to head an English fashion house . The appointment of the 63-year-old Bohan would be a coup for Hartnell 's chairman , Manny Silverman , who led a consortium that rescued Hartnell from the brink of bankruptcy in 1987 . Bohan , a star in the French fashion world , was abruptly dismissed by Dior in 1989 after 28 years and replaced by Italian designer Gianfranco Ferre . The house of Hartnell , founded in 1924 by the late Sir Norman Hartnell , has a prestigious past , which Silverman has said he wants to revive . A romantic designer who loved full skirts , embroidery and sequins , Hartnell designed the wedding and coronation gowns of Queen Elizabeth II and the floaty chiffons still worn by Queen Mother Elizabeth .
