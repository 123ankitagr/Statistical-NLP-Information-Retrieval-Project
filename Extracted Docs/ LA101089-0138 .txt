Borden Inc. said today it has agreed to acquire FIAP Group of Milan , Italy , in a move that will increase Borden 's European plastic packaging business by about 60 % . Borden , a diversified consumer products company that last month announced 7,000 layoffs and the closure of 65 dairy plants , did not disclose how much it will pay for FIAP . FIAP 's estimated 1989 sales are about $ 90 million , compared with about $ 150 million for Borden 's existing European plastic films and packaging units . Borden , the nation 's largest dairy company , also is a leading manufacturer of plastic food wraps used by institutions and restaurants .
