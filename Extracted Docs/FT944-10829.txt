a personalised cancer vaccine using genetic material cloned from the patients own tumour cells is to begin a clinical trial this month the trial was approved yesterday by the medicines control agency it is the latest example of gene therapy one of the fastest growing medical research fields and the first in which a vaccine is tailormade for each individual scientists from the cancer research campaign and medical research council working at the mrc protein engineering centre in cambridge devised the approach it is aimed initially at bcell lymphoma a relatively rare cancer of the lymph nodes affecting about 2500 people a year in britain it could later be extended to more common cancers bcell lymphoma is especially suitable for treatment with a personal vaccine because the cancer cells have marker proteins targets for attack by the bodys immune system which vary distinctly between individuals the experimental procedure involves removing the marker gene from the patients lymphoma cells and splicing it into bacteria which make millions of copies of the gene as they multiply in a culture the genes are cut out of the bacteria with special enzymes purified and injected into the patient the idea backed by promising results from animal experiments is that the reintroduced genes will make relatively large amounts of the cancer marker this should stimulate the patients immune system to attack the cancer cells more effectively than before ten patients at addenbrookes hospital cambridge and the royal bournemouth hospital will take part in the initial trial if they respond well the trial will be extended dr david secher drug development director of the cancer research campaign said its important to stress that currently this vaccine is only appropriate for patients with a particular type of bcell lymphoma however our researchers hope that further work may lead to vaccines being developed for other more common cancers the campaign is testing a nonpersonalised vaccine for bowel cancer at nottingham university it is also designed to prime the immune system to attack cancer cells the personalisation procedure is far too elaborate for potential commercial use it would have to be automated and simplified if designer vaccines were ever to become a routine treatment
