'Where artistry meets ministry ' is a long way divorced from the usual record company hyperbole . It is , nevertheless , the corporate slogan of Star Song Communications . Star Song is based in the Country & Western capital of Nashville but its artistic and moral repertoire is definitely of an evangelical nature . EMI Music , a New York-based offshoot of Thorn EMI , the music and rentals group , is strengthening its interests in the 'Christian music ' field by paying Dollars 15.5m ( Pounds 9.8m ) cash for Star Song , which has a 'strong roster ' of Christian artists and exclusive distribution agreements with several other leading US Christian music companies . EMI is already the largest force in this specialist market following its purchase in 1992 of Sparrow Corporation . Star Song will operate as a separate label within the EMI stable , and maintain its 'creative autonomy ' . Mr Stan Moser , its current president , will remain as chief executive officer . 'Where artistry meets ministry is more than a nice slogan to us . We are dedicated to taking Christ-centred music to a worldwide audience . ' Mr Jim Fifield , EMI Music 's chief executive , said that Sparrow had exceeded expectations since its acquisition . 'Star Song 's extremely diverse and strong roster will complement Sparrow 's and their combined strength will create new growth opportunities . '
