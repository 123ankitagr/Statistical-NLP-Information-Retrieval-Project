The Los Angeles City Council approved a plan Tuesday to provide space for city workers while sprinkler systems are installed in six city buildings , including the Parker Center , which may be razed to make way for a more modern facility . The council unanimously approved the $ 23-million acquisition and renovation of a three-story building at 212 N. Vignes St. to provide office space while the city buildings are brought up to code . Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky , who introduced a motion that called on city officials to seek less costly methods of bringing the buildings up to fire safety standards , noted that the city Police Department is developing a proposal concerning replacement of its 35-year-old headquarters . But Yaroslavsky added that a voter-backed bond measure would be necessary to fund such action , which could cost more than $ 100 million .
