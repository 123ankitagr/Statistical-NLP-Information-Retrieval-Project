one of the only people in her neighborhood who backed nixon against john f kennedy they stoned my house they punctured my tires and they egged my house she said today 30 years later made it worthwhile though nixon loyalists dominated thursdays crowd they did not own it others braved long lines and the sweltering heat just for the chance to see the rare gathering of four presidents on a single stage and a few took advantage of the occasion to air their political grievances there were visitors who traveled thousands of miles to see the ceremony and visitors who camped overnight to secure prime seats once inside the library compound everybody had to wait in line for up to an hour to shuffle through a security check that included metal detectors still few seemed to leave disappointed youll never see four presidents all together like this said pat yates a tustin resident its history in the making thursdays crowd of 50000 was overwhelmingly supportive of nixon and his fellow republicans but pockets of protesters were sprinkled throughout the demonstrators whose causes ranged from aids to abortion rights from the environment to central america clashed with nixon backers in a few places exchanging harsh words but stopping short of blows although tempers occasionally flared and temperatures hit 90 degrees yorba linda absorbed the huge crowd more visitors than had ever descended on the city in a single day local leaders figured and handled it without serious incident its all gone very smoothly from our perspective said brea police lt chester panique it was hot but so far weve just had a couple of minor incidents and no arrests during the speeches while some visitors scambled up bleachers and flagpoles for a better look children waded barefoot into the library fountain and the reflecting pool behind the library to take the edge off the heat dignitaries decked out in suits and silk dresses rolled up their sleeves and spent the morning fanning themselves with white programs the sun was a little easier to take for the presidents and first ladies whose stage included several air conditioners that occasionally blew a few wisps of hair out of place michael steinkraus a red cross emergency medical technician in charge of a firstaid tent behind the bleachers on thursday afternoon wearily tended to heatstricken visitors who lay on cots or paused in the shade to sit on chairs and tables its been like this all day steinkraus said adding that red cross workers had treated at least 100 people for minor heat exhaustion two a pregnant woman and an elderly woman were sent to the hospital the biggest problem is that they the dedication organizers didnt provide enough water for people to drink he said there were a lot of people here today and unfortunately we cant supply water to 100000 people police estimates ran lower than that but the heat was made all the more oppressive by the huge number of visitors who attended thursdays dedication brea police who handle yorba lindas law enforcement duties said the line of people trying to get into the event at one point stretched for two miles almost 40000 visitors passed through the metal detectors and police estimated that another 10000 people came to town took a look at the crowd and headed home that created long lines of traffic as well as boomtown business for area merchants some of whom had decorated their establishments for the occasion residents near the line outside the library sold muffins rolls and orange juice while area stores rented out parking spaces for as much as $ 20 each by early afternoon the streets were returning to normal and nearly all of the visitors had worked their way out of the city on the way many stopped long enough to scoop up nixon tshirts hats buttons and other memorabilia from vendors orange county supervisor gaddi h vasquez a longtime nixon admirer whose 1988 speech at the republican national convention won high praise from the former president picked his way back to his office thursday afternoon and glowingly pronounced the day a historic success this was really magnificent said vasquez who brought his 11yearold son to thursdays
