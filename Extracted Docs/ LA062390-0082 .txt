The discovery of a Mexican fruit fly this week in a trap in South Los Angeles has prompted agriculture officials to set scores of new traps to determine if there is an infestation in the area or if the fly is a so-called `` lone hitchhiker . '' The unmated female fly was found in a trap that had been set in a lemon tree in a residence not far from the city 's border with Vernon , said a spokesman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture . As a result , workers will set 80 additional traps in the square mile around the spot , 40 traps in the square mile surrounding that and 20 , 10 and five traps in the successive square-mile zones . Some of the fruit that attracts the Mexican fruit fly is the same that appeals to the Mediterranean fruit fly .
