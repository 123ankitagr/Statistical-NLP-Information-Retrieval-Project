The National Wildlife Federation asked a federal judge to force the Commerce Department to require Gulf Coast shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices . The department 's temporary new regulations limiting trawl times do not protect endangered sea turtles as the department claims , the federation argued . The federation said it has learned that Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher has data from National Marine Fisheries Service scientists that demonstrates the mortality rate from a 105-minute tow time is more than four times greater than what the secretary has admitted . Mosbacher decided July 24 to suspend requirements for excluder devices after Texas and Louisiana shrimpers protested their use by blockading Gulf Coast shipping channels .
