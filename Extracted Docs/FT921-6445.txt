the double life of veronique 15 curzon mayfair the last boy scout 18 mgm trocadero the man in the moon pg cannon trocadero cross my heart pg curzon phoenix i have no evidence to put before a court of law but i believe we are being hypnotised in krzysztof kieslowskis the double life of veronique how else explain the ability of a frenchpolish film with a nonsensical plot premise a girl from kracow has an exact double in clermont ferrand and dies leaving her a legacy of new awarenesses and sensitivities to enthrall and enchant us like no european film in recent memory hypnotists we know often use objects to fascinate and transfix their patients likewise kieslowski as in earlier films camera buff no end a short film about killing the screen is a mystical assaultcourse of the ordinary made extraordinary a lightbulb a glass bauble a teabag floating in hot water the inanimate world glows as mysteriously as the animate through these deceiving sensory spaces in which rain patterns on a wall seem as tactile as real rain on the face or in which an innocent puppet show prophesies or recapitulates real events weronica and veronique both played by cannes best actress irene jacob step into selfrealisation yes but what is it all about neither heroine knows her doppelganger and they glimpse each other only once in a demonstrationtorn polish square yet like twins they have nearsymbiotic tastes feelings and skills both are gifted classical singers they also share a heart ailment which kills polish weronica in midconcert bequeathing to french veronique an instant bewildering sense of loss the death also precipitates a series of trysts with a young writer and puppet showman philippe volter who may be a conduit between the dead girl and the living political metaphorseekers will no doubt spy a fable in which the eastern blocs demise arouses a belated sense of kinship in the west with the artist as mage or mediator but the films magic is belittled by pat equations kieslowski offers something larger a vision of the world as an evolving miracle of the imagination a floating interchange between past present and future whose panhuman perspective allows each individual tragedy to be redeemed by kindred lives facing kindred challenges but even above and beyond such larger decodings this beautiful film is its own enigma as cryptic and glittering as the glass ball in citizen kane which has a twin here and endowed with a soaring human radiance both in repose and in response by irene jacob meanwhile back in hollywood you too like screenwriter shane black who sold his script of the last boy scout for a recordbreaking dollars 175m could earn large sums by submitting seemingly simple action ideas to hollywood just follow mr blacks guidelines whenever anyone is rude to his

hollywood multimillionaire by directing expensive tripe beverly hills cop 2 days of thunder gives the last boy scout his usual highgloss visuals los angeles throbs with burnished glamour as mr willis

the deep end without waterwings and cameraman freddie francis stands by to paint the gorgeous backcloth of a southern summer my handkerchief remained unused in jacques fanstens cross my heart although i might have taken it out to wave in surrender as the film keeps firing the same trite story ammunition at us when martin sylvain copans a fatherless 12yearold loses his mother he tries to conceal her
