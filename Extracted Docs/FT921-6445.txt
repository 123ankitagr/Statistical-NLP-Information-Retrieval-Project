the double life of veronique 15 curzon mayfair the last boy scout 18 mgm trocadero the man in the moon pg cannon trocadero cross my heart pg curzon phoenix i have no evidence to put before a court of law but i believe we are being hypnotised in krzysztof kieslowski's the double life of veronique how else explain the ability of a french-polish film with a nonsensical plot premise a girl from kracow has an exact double in clermont ferrand and dies leaving her a legacy of new awarenesses and sensitivities to enthrall and enchant us like no european film in recent memory hypnotists we know often use objects to fascinate and transfix their patients likewise kieslowski as in earlier films camera buff no end a short film about killing the screen is a mystical assault-course of the ordinary made extraordinary a lightbulb a glass bauble a tea-bag floating in hot water the inanimate world glows as mysteriously as the animate through these deceiving sensory spaces in which rain patterns on a wall seem as tactile as real rain on the face or in which an innocent puppet show prophesies or recapitulates real events weronica and veronique both played by cannes best actress irene jacob step into self-realisation yes but what is it all about neither heroine knows her doppelganger and they glimpse each other only once in a demonstration-torn polish square yet like twins they have near-symbiotic tastes feelings and skills both are gifted classical singers they also share a heart ailment which kills polish weronica in mid-concert bequeathing to french veronique an instant bewildering sense of loss the death also precipitates a series of trysts with a young writer and puppet showman philippe volter who may be a conduit between the dead girl and the living political metaphor-seekers will no doubt spy a fable in which the eastern bloc's demise arouses a belated sense of kinship in the west with the artist as mage or mediator but the film's magic is belittled by pat equations kieslowski offers something larger a vision of the world as an evolving miracle of the imagination a floating interchange between past present and future whose panhuman perspective allows each individual tragedy to be redeemed by kindred lives facing kindred challenges but even above and beyond such larger decodings this beautiful film is its own enigma as cryptic and glittering as the glass ball in citizen kane which has a twin here and endowed with a soaring human radiance both in repose and in response by irene jacob meanwhile back in hollywood you too like screenwriter shane black who sold his script of the last boy scout for a record-breaking dollars 1.75 m could earn large sums by submitting seemingly simple action ideas to hollywood just follow mr black's guidelines whenever anyone is rude to his film's hero battered wisecracking detective bruce willis make sure he is punched in the nose whenever anyone tries to fix an american football game make sure he is punched in the nose whenever anyone is unkind to animals or fails to help an old lady cross a street make sure he is punched in the nose we have never seen so many people punched in the nose british director tony scott who has become a hollywood multi-millionaire by directing expensive tripe beverly hills cop 2, days of thunder gives the last boy scout his usual high-gloss visuals los angeles throbs with burnished glamour as mr willis and his adopted sidekick daman wayans a black ex-footballer threatened by a cartel of villains proceed through town bashing and being bashed nose-pokings are supplemented by hand-stabbings knee-bashings and electric cattle-proddings and whenever a car is stepped into we know it will be written off at the end of the sequence one of our hero's proud past achievements we see it in flashback is to have saved jimmy carter's life he was once a presidential bodyguard it seems who threw himself between jc and a passing bullet this indication that a man of willis's timbre once worked for the democratic party may be the best campaign advertisement the republicans have yet had the week's paper-handkerchief franchise is fought over

mulligan summer of 42, bloodbrothers directs as if knowing how to throw us into the deep end without water-wings and cameraman freddie francis stands by to paint the gorgeous backcloth of a southern summer my handkerchief remained unused in jacques fansten's cross my heart although i might have taken it out to wave in surrender as the film keeps firing the same trite story ammunition at us when
