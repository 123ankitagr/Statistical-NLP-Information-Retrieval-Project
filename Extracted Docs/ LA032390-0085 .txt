The Moorpark City Council has settled a four-month squabble over the ceremonial title of mayor by agreeing that two council members will take turns in the post until the November elections . Mayor Paul Lawrason will continue as mayor until mid-May , when Councilman Bernardo Perez takes over , council members decided on a 4-1 vote . Perez will be the city 's ninth mayor . For the first time , Moorpark voters will select a mayor in November . The mayor had been selected by the City Council since incorporation in 1983 . Councilwoman Eloise Brown opposed the move , saying that Perez had indicated in November that he did not want to accept a short-term position . The decision settles a dispute that broke out at a council meeting Nov. 15 when Councilman Scott Montgomery suggested that three people who had not served as mayor share the post . Until that point , Lawrason , Montgomery and Perez had not served as mayor . At that time , Perez and Councilman Clint Harper opposed the decision . However , Montgomery on Wednesday said he decided to give up his ambitions to the post to resolve what has become a sometimes comic debate referred to as `` musical mayors . '' The position of mayor carries no benefits other than presiding over council meetings and representing the city at official functions . PSYCHE PASCUAL
