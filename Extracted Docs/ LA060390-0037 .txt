A 4-year-old Buenaventura , Mexico , boy who was minutes away from a liver transplant died before surgeons in Dallas could begin the operation . Parents and physicians at Children 's Medical Center had been elated but anxious when they learned Friday that a liver had been found for Sammy Aguirre , but doctors said the boy 's condition had seriously deteriorated . The donated liver came from a Florida child who was slightly larger than Sammy , said Sammy 's doctor , Dr . Troy Reyna . The organ was sent to another liver transplant patient , hospital spokeswoman Sylvia Bodell said .
