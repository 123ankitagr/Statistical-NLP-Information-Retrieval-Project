a few months after he resigned richard m nixon pondered the fate of the hundreds of former white house employees who shared his dreams fought his battles and were then left in the lurch by watergate some of them had trouble finding new jobs having been tainted by the scandal and many shared an experience from inside the white house that could not really be understood by an outsider for a long time those of us who had these connections were pariahs recalled ken khachigian who began his lauded presidential speechwriting career with nixon so you found comfort and solace in being amongst your own in january 1975 nixon met in san clemente with a former presidential advance man and suggested that he keep in touch with the former white house staffers the following month dewey clower called together 25 of them and launched the february group named after the month in which its first meeting was held tonight 15 years later the february group is scheduled to host one of the largest gatherings of nixon administration alumni since watergate nixon himself is expected to attend the cocktail reception at his presidential library in yorba linda on the eve of its dedication add all of the longtime nixon supporters and family scheduled to attend thursdays dedication and it will probably be the real first and last conclave of those who have been associated with richard nixon since his second inaugural said patrick j buchanan a conservative political commentator and former nixon speech writer in washington where job security is often an oxymoron an alumni association for a presidential administration makes sense but surprisingly it is the nixon white house that has created the largest and most active such group from the 25 members who organized on feb 10 1975 the group has grown to include a mailing list of more than 600 including many members of the ford and reagan administrations in fact when ronald reagan won the presidency in 1980 clower said the white house used the february group mailing list to locate potential staff and the group became big enough that columnist jack anderson once called it a government in exile today the february group meets twice a year usually for an evening of socializing over cocktails with about 100 to 150 people at a washington hotel the february group is essentially dedicated to maintaining a network that nixon established as early as his 1968 presidential campaign to do that it hosts the cocktail hours and from a desktop computer clower publishes a periodic newsletter with updates on the lives of group members clower gladly points out what the group is not it does not have a political agenda it is not for fund raising and it is not even wellorganized he says its a looseknit organization no dues no officers clower said its basically just a time for people to get together its who is where who has had babies who got married who has a new job most of the members especially those who remain active are middlelevel nixon white house staffers whose names never reached the newspapers the former presidents favorite barber milt pitts is among them but nixons top officers and cabinet members are also on the february group rolls former chief of staff hr haldeman belongs as does appointments secretary dwight chapin and aide john erlichman its for people who worked together and have stayed in touch or have a chance to renew friendships said ron ziegler nixons press secretary and a group member i think almost everyone who served in those years is on the mailing list erlichman now a novelist who lives in santa fe nm reportedly sent a letter to one february group gathering that said sorry i cant be there ill be doing something elsewhere he was in jail at the time in connection with watergate watergate may have been partly responsible for the cohesion of the former nixon employees at least at first but clower also said the nixon white house was simply a tighter group than most i worked briefly in the ford administration and i think the nixon people were closer together clower said i think the times probably had something to do with it it is well known that a lot of people had difficulty finding jobs and perhaps things like that draw people together there are times when i just want to drop this february group activity but then people call up and they really want to keep it going khachigian also said the camaraderie among nixons staff is unique the february group is the nixon guys who sort of out the ashes of his resignation said hey we aint down lets stick together he said i call it a sort of gathering of the clan theres a lot of war stories to be told as for the future of the february group clower said hes uncertain whether it will dissolve with the aging of the nixon staff or whether it will evolve into something bigger maybe it will continue he said it really has become a group for republican administrations whos coming patrick j buchanan then white house speech writer now
