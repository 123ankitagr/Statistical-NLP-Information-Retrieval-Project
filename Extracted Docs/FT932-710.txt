on wednesday at the spitalfields festival richard hickox and the northern sinfonia played shostakovich and walton and despite support from the walton trust shostakovich won the bear walton's hearty one-act opera after chekhov's rather subtler piece was not ideally placed after shostakovich's 14 th symphony which is desperately serious and scathing in fact the opera was excellently cast with della jones singing a larger-than-life popova the volatile widow with airs and a gruff explosive smirnov who comes to collect a debt and ends by collecting popova instead from alan opie both of them flung themselves into the comedy with fervour bordering on frenzy yet we didn't laugh much the singers diction was beyond reproach but walton's racketty little orchestra a small battalion of percussion raucous muted brass loomed just behind them and in the resonant christ church acoustic the instruments were impossible to keep decently down miss jones and opie soon found themselves belting out most of their music just to make it heard amid the roar one wanted more half-lights slyer character which they could certainly provide in a more singer-friendly setting and indeed in a staging physical confrontation is essential to this comedy and face-pulling while they sang straight from the score made a thin substitute adjusted to a proper theatre this performance ought to be delightful it enjoyed the bonus of a very superior manservant since the bass stephen richardson was on hand for the shostakovich anyway there he was greatly impressive as was miss jones and their russian too gutturally persuasive to an inexpert ear like mine and used to biting effect the symphony is a 1969 song-cycle on poems translated from lorca apollinaire and rilke and one by wilhelm kuchelbecker all concerned with death persecution lofty anger and grim despair the vocal lines are etched into an extraordinary small-orchestra score bleakly spare strings frosted with touches of celesta vibes xylophone bells an unforgettable sub-arctic sound world hickox conducted it with cool exact sympathy and drew admirably sensitive playing from the northern sinfonia no risk here of overwhelming the singers who were left free to penetrate the songs in depth despite the presiding tone of this disillusioned music the range of bitter expression is wide and varied and both artists were in formidable command of it after the insights of their performance i thought i might at last begin to understand shostakovich's hitherto opaque 15 th symphony
