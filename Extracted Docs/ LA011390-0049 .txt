A top aide to Mayor Marion Barry allegedly promised to deliver a city contract to an undercover FBI agent posing as a private contractor if the man first contributed to Barry 's 1986 reelection effort , according to court documents unsealed Friday . The official , former city human services head David E. Rivers , allegedly told an undercover FBI agent during an October , 1986 , meeting that he would be awarded a contract if he contributed money to a Barry reelection fund-raising effort Rivers was organizing in Atlanta . According to the court records , Rivers said : `` Ya 'll just do this , '' gesturing to invitations to the fund raiser , `` It 's ( the contract ) done right now . '' The court records were unsealed after a hearing in which a federal judge denied a request by Rivers and prominent city contractor John Clyburn that wiretap evidence gathered against them be suppressed in their trial on bribery and conspiracy charges . The accusations against Rivers and Clyburn are the latest in a long string that have been lodged against people close to the mayor .
