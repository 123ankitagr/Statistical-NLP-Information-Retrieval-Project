Purchase Completed : Royal Trustco Ltd. , the Toronto financial services conglomerate that bought Pacific Savings Bank in Costa Mesa in mid-October , has completed its purchase of Pacific First Financial Corp. , a Seattle thrift holding company . And the Seattle firm has completed its previously announced purchase of the California-based residential real estate construction lending unit of Old Stone Bank , a federal S & L based in Providence , R.I. Like the purchase of Pacific Savings , the purchase of the Old Stone assets will help Royal Trust establish a thrift operation along the West Coast . Pacific First Financial operates S & Ls in Washington and Oregon and manages Pacific Savings , now called Pacific First Bank . Eventually , all thrift operations will be merged into one and will be run out of Seattle . As part of its deal to acquire Pacific First Financial , Royal Trust agreed to sell over time about 1.4 million shares of Glenfed Inc. , the Glendale holding company of Glendale Federal Savings & Loan . Royal Trust had acquired 9.5 % , or about 2.5 million shares , of Glenfed and must reduce its holdings to less than 5 % to comply with federal law . Compiled by James S. Granelli / Times staff writer
