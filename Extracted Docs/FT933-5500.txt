THE Bundesbank can still meet its target for money supply growth for 1993 , Mr Helmut Schlesinger , the president of the German central bank , said yesterday . Mr Schlesinger 's remarks , combined with an optimistic assessment of the outlook for inflation in Germany , may serve to revive hopes of further reductions in short-term rates when the Bundesbank policy-making council meets again next week . The rate of growth in broad money M3 was 7.5 per cent in July on an annualised , seasonally adjusted basis , compared to a target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent . Driven up by high bank lending and the impact of the Bundesbank 's currency market intervention , the growth in M3 is restricting the central bank's freedom to cut interest rates . This was acknowledged last week by Mr Otmar Issing , the Bundesbank 's chief economist and member of its policy making council , who said that the growth in money supply had made it impossible to cut rates last Thursday . Mr Schlesinger said that while the current level of inflation - running at annual rate of over 4 per cent - was unsatisfactory , there were signs that price pressures were calming down .
