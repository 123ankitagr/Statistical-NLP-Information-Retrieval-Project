the bundesbank can still meet its target for money supply growth for 1993, mr helmut schlesinger the president of the german central bank said yesterday mr schlesinger's remarks combined with an optimistic assessment of the outlook for inflation in germany may serve to revive hopes of further reductions in short-term rates when the bundesbank policy-making council meets again next week the rate of growth in broad money m3 was 7.5 per cent in july on an annualised seasonally adjusted basis compared to a target range of 4.5 to 6.5 per cent driven up by high bank lending and the impact of the bundesbank's currency market intervention the growth in m3 is restricting the central bank's freedom to cut interest rates this was acknowledged last week by mr otmar issing the bundesbank's chief economist and member of its policy making council who said that the growth in money supply had made it impossible to cut rates last thursday mr schlesinger said that while the current level of inflation running at annual rate of over 4 per cent was unsatisfactory there were signs that price pressures were calming down
