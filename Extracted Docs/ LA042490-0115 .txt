The entire population of a small outback town in eastern Australia -- about 1,600 people -- prepared Monday for an immediate evacuation because of rising floodwaters , authorities said . The Warrego River is expected to inundate Cunnamulla , a town about 500 miles west of Brisbane , sometime today . The river is rising after more than two weeks of heavy rain that have caused the worst flooding in western Queensland state in more than a century . Four people have been confirmed dead , and five are missing . About 30,000 are still isolated as farmers in Queensland , New South Wales and Victoria reeled from the loss of an estimated 100,000 sheep and cattle .
