Honda and Nissan are both considering buying diesel engines from European car makers in an attempt to meet growing demand . Honda said that Peugeot was among a number of candidates to supply diesel engines for its Civic model , which is to replace the Concerto . The Japanese car maker is already selling Concertos in Europe with Peugeot diesel engines . The Concertos are manufactured for Honda by Rover . Honda does not make diesel engines of its own and trying to develop one would be extremely costly . Honda denied that it was in detailed negotiations with specific companies but confirmed that Peugeot was among a number of possible candidates . Nissan is also considering using European diesel engines in its Primera cars . These are exported from Japan and currently have Japanese engines . Because of the rise of the yen , it is expensive to export diesel engines from Japan to Europe , Nissan said . 'Diesel engines will become more widespread in Europe and if we decide that buying from another manufacturer on an original equipment manufacturing basis is the best way to go , we will consider it , ' the company added . The interest both companies have shown in buying diesel engines in Europe represents a marked step away from past practice among Japanese car makers , which have considered it crucial to use their own engines .
