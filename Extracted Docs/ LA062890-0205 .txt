City Manager Jim Armstrong is leaving his post to become assistant city manager in Anaheim . He is the third Kings County city manager to move to larger cities in recent months . Armstrong , who has managed the city of 29,000 residents for seven years , will resign effective July 20 , he announced on Wednesday . He said the move to Anaheim , which has 240,000 residents and a budget of about $ 550 million , is a wonderful career opportunity . Armstrong is following the lead of former Corcoran City Manager George Lambert , who left for Norco in Riverside County in May , and former Avenal City Manager Steve Casey , who accepted a job in Crescent City earlier this month . As a result of the recent moves , Lemoore City Manager Allen Goodman wants to put to rest any speculation that he might follow his colleagues to bigger cities . `` I 'm staying , '' he said .
