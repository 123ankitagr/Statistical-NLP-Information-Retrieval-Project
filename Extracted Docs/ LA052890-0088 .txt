the rain fell softly and steadily on stanford's sunken diamond sunday causing the postponement of the ncaa west i regional championship between stanford and san diego state first until later sunday afternoon and finally until noon today the rain was welcomed by a weary sdsu team a team that spent saturday playing two emotional games going through six pitchers two ankles and 19 innings before finally arriving at the championship late saturday night assistant coach gary brown was finishing up bed checks when he laid out the ideal scenario he mentioned the rainy forecast and then grinned the kind of grin you use when you're up to something it rains sunday he said and cancels the game then monday all of the aztec pitchers are rested and ready to go meanwhile stanford is still without ace stan spencer who threw nine innings saturday morning perfect sure enough the aztecs woke up to rain sunday first the game was postponed from noon until 3 p m so the aztecs arrived at sunken diamond a few minutes after 2, when the rain had stopped five minutes later it started again heavily and the tarp was pulled over the field see you tomorrow tournament officials said thank god sdsu coach jim dietz said we've played one extra game due to being in the loser's bracket and gotten up for two games at 6 a m it will help us maybe it won't have any bearing on the game but it won't hurt us to win the tournament and go to the college world series the aztecs 49-21 must defeat no 1 stanford twice stanford 55-10 without a loss in this double-elimination tournament just needs to win once if sdsu wins at noon it will face stanford again today at 4 p m the aztecs are coming off a day saturday when they lost to stanford 6-2 but turned around and defeated southern illinois 4-3 in 10 innings so it's easy to see why stanford coach mark marquess was disappointed with sunday's rainout we wanted to get them today marquess said sunday they're coming off a tough day saturday with the doubleheader i'd love to play them today but whether this is a big advantage for san diego state or a big advantage for stanford i don't know by taking sunday off the aztecs were able to rest which was particularly important for their pitchers and two players with injured ankles second baseman scott dennison the team's leading hitter with a 362 average sprained an ankle saturday and wouldn't have played sunday now he figures to be available today he probably won't start but he should be able to be used late in a game he'll probably be 80 monday dietz said today he was probably 40 dennison spent most of sunday taking whirlpool and ultrasound treatments third baseman steve boucher also sprained an ankle saturday but his wasn't as bad boucher should be 100 today as for the pitching staff dietz said if need be he will use all eight pitchers in the first game and if the aztecs win turn around and use all eight of them in the second game i'm serious he said then he paused the raindrops continued i've got a gut feeling things will be kind of interesting tomorrow he said aztec notes the rain is supposed to let up by this morning a last case scenario in case the rain continues is that an ncaa committee will pick this region's representative to the college world series which begins friday tournament director jerry kindall baseball coach at the university of arizona said the championship could be played as late as tuesday he wouldn't speculate further but wednesday should also be possible sdsu will likely start kevin nielsen 4-3 4.53 earned-run average today at noon stanford will probably go with brian sackinsky 8-1 5.07 sdsu alumnus joe cusimano who lives in the bay area took the team out to dinner sunday night they're coming out of the woodwork sdsu coach jim dietz said i'd say that i've actually shaken hands with or talked to conservatively 100 people just alumni or people in some way connected with sdsu former sdsu and nfl quarterback jesse freitas was one shhhh the aztecs have plane and hotel reservations all set for the college world series as well as meal money and cash advances if they defeat stanford twice today they're scheduled to leave san diego for omaha neb on tuesday
