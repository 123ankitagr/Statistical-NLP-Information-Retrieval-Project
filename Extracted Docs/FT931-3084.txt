here is a novel idea for public sector railway managers tired of complaints about unreliable trains easy take pounds 30 m of taxpayers money give it to an independent contractor and leave the private sector to put things right that at least seems to be the thrust of the unprecedented deal struck by london's docklands light railway last week in appointing brown root the us engineering group as its prime contractor brown root will not take over the day-to-day running of the railway but over the next three years it will manage the remaining stages of an pounds 800 m expansion and improvement programme at the end of that time it must deliver a railway that works its pounds 30 m fee is geared directly to results the significance of the deal is that it is wholly uncharacteristic of the railway industry railwaymen fervently oppose the notion that anyone should come between them and their trains they insist on controlling every aspect of building and running the system with the private sector's role limited to that of sub-contractor and supplier but the docklands light railway's managers are not railwaymen since november 1991, they have been a team of defence procurement experts drafted in from the ministry of defence their chairman sir peter levene is former head of defence procurement at the mod he also heads the prime minister's efficiency unit when sir peter and his team arrived the docklands light railway was in such disarray that the government had seized control of it from london transport and passed it to the london docklands development corporation its poor performance can be partly blamed on the fact that it was built on a shoestring budget of pounds 77 m at a time when the government's ambitions for docklands were modest when olympia york the canadian property developer proposed transforming canary wharf into london's third commercial centre the toy-town railway had to be improved when the government responded by authorising an pounds 800 m expansion and upgrading of the line the immediate effect was to make matters worse already incapable of meeting the demands being made on it the system had to cope with being rebuilt while trains were still running consequently services deteriorated to the point of chaos but was there more to its poor performance than this today the railway is running 98 per cent of scheduled train mileage compared with a low of 67 per cent before the management changeover what caused such a drastic turnround sir peter says some simple management actions produced quick results for example his team discovered that the computer controlling the train operations was overloaded that was rectified through the seemingly obvious action of trimming the train service another step was getting to grips with the contractors responsible for supplying track trains and so on some of contractors were performing extremely badly says sir peter the dlr people said we've written to them and asked them to do better but they're just not doing that i said well let's stop paying them they said you can't do that they'll sue so i said let them the result some sharp words were exchanged but the performance of those contractors changed overnight to be fair to london transport it could be argued that the improvements in the railway's performance might have happened without the change in management conceivably sir peter's team simply enjoyed the fruits of action initiated by the previous incumbents london transport however acknowledges sir peter and his colleagues wrought changes one advantage they enjoyed was the freedom to act without constant reference to headquarters another was their reputation for tough dealing with contractors such as gec while at the defence ministry indeed that was one of the main reasons for bringing them in it was a logical extension of this last point that led to the decision to appoint a prime contractor the team is now applying the techniques of defence contracting to railway projects says sir peter if the defence ministry wants to order a new fighter aircraft it does not deal with dozens of contractors making all the sub-systems it defines the performance it wants signs a contract for delivery with a single company such as british aerospace and leaves it to the prime contractor to deliver the aircraft it wants as in the defence industry so in transport sir peter's team will no longer deal with dozen contractors involved in the extension of the railway to beckton the installation of a new control system and the supply of new trains that and the integration of these parts into a smoothly-running whole will be brown root's job is this the way of the future for other railway projects possibly one worrying factor however must be cost theoretically a private-sector contractor motivated by a performance-related fee will do a better job at project management than a flabby public-sector body but the docklands light railway only brings in pounds 3 m a year in ticket sales seen in that light pounds 30 m seems an awful lot to pay the cynical view might be that the government is prepared to nod the deal through hoping it will better prepare the railway for its planned privatisation so it might but that says sir peter is not the point the question is whether it represents good value for money everyone's been satisfied that's the case and now we are going ahead i think we would be criticised for spoiling the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar if having spent pounds 800 m on the railway we had not spent another pounds 30 m in getting it to work
