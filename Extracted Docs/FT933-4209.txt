french car manufacturers cannot remember when times were so hard recession at home falling demand in most of their principal european markets and the increased price competitiveness of many of their international rivals have left peugeot-citroen and renault struggling to respond to the downturn the domestic market burdened by a sluggish economy and depressed consumer confidence contracted by 17 per cent in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 1992 motor industry analysts see little hope for rapid improvement there isn't any sign of an upturn for the rest of the year says mr bob barber at james capel who forecasts a full year decline in the french car market of about 15 per cent the downturn has taken its toll on the two principal carmakers particularly in their home market registrations of peugeot-citroen cars in france fell by almost 19 per cent to 300,500 vehicles in the first seven months of 1993 renault did better but still suffered a fall of 12.7 per cent to 314,000 vehicles according to figures from the committee of french automobile constructors profits will naturally be affected renault the world's most profitable car manufacturer in 1992 in terms of the ratio of net profits to sales saw pre-tax profits plunge by by almost 90 per cent from ffr5 44 bn to ffr730m in the first half of the year peugeot-citroen which saw profits fall from ffr5 53 bn to ffr3 37 bn in 1992, is expected by most car industry analysts to fall into loss this year amid the gloom however there are some signs of encouragement improved sales in the uk and increased market share in germany allowed peugeot-citroen to report first half sales of ffr73 05 bn a fall of 11.4 per cent over the first half of 1992 this decline masked a relatively strong second quarter in which sales fell by 6.8 per cent the results were better than expected says one french car industry analyst adding that the introduction of new models such as the citroen xantia and the peugeot 306 would help sales particularly with the introduction in june of diesel models for renault there is consolation in the fact that the company is winning market share from its domestic rival and from international manufacturers renault has continued to strengthen its image at the expense of peugeot says one car industry executive in paris citing the safrane the high-end model which has enjoyed a successful introduction for both car manufacturers there is also the potential benefit of a weaker franc peugeot-citroen and renault have both lost competitiveness compared with manufacturers in spain the uk and italy which have all seen their currencies depreciate significantly over the past nine months the weakening of the european exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of last month however has brought a depreciation of the franc of about 3 per cent it has also raised the prospect of reduced financial costs through lower interest rates but the prospect of continued depressed demand raises a series of difficult decisions for the french carmakers in particular they are faced with the need to reduce production to adapt to the adverse conditions peugeot-citroen has already announced reduced working days at its factories in mulhouse and sochaux in eastern france and is reducing its workforce by almost 3,000 this year it has also announced that it is stopping production of its 405 model in its uk factory car industry analysts in paris say that for renault the downturn in the market increases pressure to finalise its merger with volvo the swedish car manufacturer so as to achieve production economies mr gerard longuet the french industry minister is pressing renault to complete the alliance with volvo to prepare the french carmaker for privatisation a final deal which is thought to be imminent will give the merged company 12 per cent of the european car market and more than 20 per cent of the european truck market it will allow the merged company to achieve economies of scale and reduced production costs and enable joint marketing and research operations if the french government has sought to galvanise the two companies into a speedier marriage it has also sought to protect the french car market from what it regards as unwelcome suitors both mr longuet and mr alain lamassoure the minister for european affairs have appealed to the european commission to re-open negotiations with japanese car manufacturers concerning the level of their exports to the european market the french government argues that the worse than expected decline in the european market requires a further cut in japanese exports the japanese ministry of trade and industry had previously agreed to a reduction of about 9.4 per cent in exports to the ec based on a fall in european car sales of 6.5 per cent the two sides are expected to meet again in september to discuss the issue but the mood of the french car makers is unlikely to have been improved by then
