french car manufacturers can not remember when times were so hard recession at home falling demand in most of their principal european markets and the increased price competitiveness of many of their international rivals have left peugeotcitroen and renault struggling to respond to the downturn the domestic market burdened by a sluggish economy and depressed consumer confidence contracted by 17 per cent in the first seven months of the year compared to the same period in 1992 motor industry analysts see little hope for rapid improvement there isnt any sign of an upturn for the rest of the year says mr bob barber at james capel who forecasts a full year decline in the french car market of about 15 per cent the downturn has taken its toll on the two principal carmakers particularly in their home market registrations of peugeotcitroen cars in france fell by almost 19 per cent to 300500 vehicles in the first seven months of 1993 renault did better but still suffered a fall of 127 per cent to 314000 vehicles according to figures from the committee of french automobile constructors profits will naturally be affected renault the worlds most profitable car manufacturer in 1992 in terms of the ratio of net profits to sales saw pretax profits plunge by by almost 90 per cent from ffr544bn to ffr730m in the first half of the year peugeotcitroen which saw profits fall from ffr553bn to ffr337bn in 1992 is expected by most car industry analysts to fall into loss this year amid the gloom however there are some signs of encouragement improved sales in the uk and increased market share in germany allowed peugeotcitroen to report first half sales of ffr7305bn a fall of 114 per cent over the first half of 1992 this decline masked a relatively strong second quarter in which sales fell by 68 per cent the results were better than expected says one french car industry analyst adding that the introduction of new models such as the citroen xantia and the peugeot 306 would help sales particularly with the introduction in june of diesel models for renault there is consolation in the fact that the company is winning market share from its domestic rival and from international manufacturers renault has continued to strengthen its image at the expense of peugeot says one car industry executive in paris citing the safrane the highend model which has enjoyed a successful introduction for both car manufacturers there is also the potential benefit of a weaker franc peugeotcitroen and renault have both lost competitiveness compared with manufacturers in spain the uk and italy which have all seen their currencies depreciate significantly over the past nine months the weakening of the european exchange rate mechanism at the beginning of last month however has brought a depreciation of the franc of about 3 per cent it has also raised the prospect of reduced financial costs through lower interest rates but the prospect of continued depressed demand raises a series of difficult decisions for the french carmakers in particular they are faced with the need to reduce production to adapt to the adverse conditions peugeotcitroen has already announced reduced working days at its factories in mulhouse and sochaux in eastern france and is reducing its workforce by almost 3000 this year it has also announced that it is stopping production of its 405 model in its uk factory car industry analysts in paris say that for renault the downturn in the market increases pressure to finalise its merger with volvo the swedish car manufacturer so as to achieve production economies mr gerard longuet the french industry minister is pressing renault to complete the alliance with volvo to prepare the french carmaker for privatisation a final deal which is thought to be imminent will give the merged company 12 per cent of the european car market and more than 20 per cent of the european truck market it will allow the merged company to achieve economies of scale and reduced production costs and enable joint marketing and research operations if the french government has sought to galvanise the two companies into a speedier marriage it has also sought to protect the french car market from what it regards as unwelcome suitors both mr longuet and mr alain lamassoure the minister for european affairs have appealed to the european commission to reopen negotiations with japanese car manufacturers concerning the level of their exports to the european market the french government argues that the worse than expected decline in the european market requires a further cut in japanese exports the japanese ministry of trade and industry had previously agreed to a reduction of about 94 per cent in exports to the ec based on a fall in european car sales of 65 per cent the two sides are expected to meet again in september to discuss the issue but the mood of the french car makers is unlikely to have been improved by then
