Germany yesterday charged communist spymaster Mr Markus Wolf with spying and treason for running at least 12 agents against Bonn during the cold war , including one who brought down Chancellor Willy Brandt , Reuter reports . The prosecutor 's office said Mr Wolf , who headed East Germany 's spy network from 1953 to 1986 , had up to 600 agents in West Germany . Germany 's constitutional court has yet to rule whether Bonn can try East Germans for espionage , since they acted within the laws of a sovereign state and did much the same work as West German spies .
