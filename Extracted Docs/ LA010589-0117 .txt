A mountain lion that apparently roamed into Reno in search of food led police on a 6 1/2-hour chase Wednesday before it was captured as it lounged on the patio at a restaurant . Police said the 65-pound female lion , which was first spotted at the Peppermill hotel-casino before daybreak , was stung by two tranquilizer darts as it lay under a bench at the Hacienda del Sol restaurant near the Peppermill . Reno Animal Control and state Department of Wildlife workers took the drugged lion away . Wildlife spokesman Dave Rice said the animal will be taken to a remote area outside Reno and released . Telephone calls began coming into the police station at about 5:25 a.m. , when a parking lot attendant at the Peppermill and several Virginia Lake joggers reported seeing the animal , Sgt . Greg Dion said . Dion said animal tracks were spotted by police leading from the Peppermill to Virginia Lake . The lion dropped out of sight until just before noon , when workers preparing lunch at the Hacienda del Sol saw it on the patio , according to restaurant manager Barry Rivlin . Rice said mountain lion sightings are not unusual in Reno , although the animals usually slip in and out unnoticed .
