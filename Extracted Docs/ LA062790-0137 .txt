Pacific Symphony , which had announced that it would accept a $ 45,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts , has received official notification of the award and will indeed accept it , Pacific Symphony executive director Louis G. Spisto said Monday . Several U.S. arts groups have rejected NEA subsidies rather than sign what is being described as an anti-obscenity pledge . Spisto said his organization will continue to fight for an NEA that does not restrict the content of artworks . Pro-NEA letters to legislators and concert audiences will continue through the summer , he said.ZAN DUBIN
