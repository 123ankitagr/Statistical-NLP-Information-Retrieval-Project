The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers decided it will not try to use explosives to break up a huge ice jam on the Mississippi River , which has been virtually closed to barge traffic . Corps officials met in St. Louis with officials of the U.S. Coast Guard and representatives of the barge industry . Lt. Cmdr . Myles Boothe of the Coast Guard said there would be no attempt to blast now because the ice cover is not posing an immediate threat . Wednesday marked the third day that a 203-mile stretch of the river from St. Louis to Cairo , Ill. , was all but closed because of ice and low water .
