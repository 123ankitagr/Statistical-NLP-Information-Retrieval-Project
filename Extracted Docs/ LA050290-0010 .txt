Milken 's pleading guilty to fraud really does not prove to me that he is . Nor is it a cause for celebration . What it does prove is that federal prosecutors have unlimited power and resources at their command . That they can coerce , intimidate and threaten anyone into confessing whatever they want , without a trial . It is a sad day for all Americans . Because if someone with the wealth and connections of a Michael Milken can be forced into admitting what he does not believe , what chance do the rest of us have ? DON FEIN Brentwood
