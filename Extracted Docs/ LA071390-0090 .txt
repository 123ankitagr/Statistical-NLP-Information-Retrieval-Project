game when i got seven days notice that i was going to africa i had to get a passport a visa and vaccine shots but mostly i was concerned about the danger of the trip and my health i wasnt in the kind of physical shape needed to make a climb like that and i had no experience well brown made the trip survived and is a key part of an emotionpacked onehour special that will be part of this weekends cbs sports sunday show at 11 am for brown the assignment he didnt want turned out to be one of the most rewarding things hes ever done the best part he said was making new friends he called it

the youngest at 19 and the only woman became ill and could not continue one who did make it to the top joe hayden 22 of westmorland at first said he didnt want to go on without brown his new friend said brown he told me he was scared and wanted me to accompany him but the organizers thought it best if i didnt we hugged and he told me he was going to make the climb for me the group that continued to the summit returned to base camp a day after the others producer tollin said when the two groups were reunited the emotion was unbelievable there was no jealousy about who got to go on and who didnt only about 25 of the people who attempt to climb kilimanjaro make it to the top this group did better than that despite terrible weather conditions here were people who had been told about limitations all their lives tollin said but as a group they had shown what they could do it didnt matter which individuals had made it to the top they had accomplished something extraordinary as a
