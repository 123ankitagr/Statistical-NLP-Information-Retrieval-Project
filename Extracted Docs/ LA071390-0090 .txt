be accompanying a group of mentally disabled young people on the climb oh and take warm clothing you'll need it it happened to james brown of cbs i'll be honest about it brown said thursday from his home in washington when i was first told about it i hated the assignment i asked ted shaker brown's boss does my job depend on whether or not i go here i was preparing to do an oklahoma-seton hall basketball game when i got seven days notice that i was going to africa i had to get a passport a visa and vaccine shots but mostly i was concerned about the danger of the trip and my health i wasn't in the kind of physical shape needed to make a climb like that and i had no experience well brown made the trip survived and is a key part of an emotion-packed one-hour special that will be part of this weekend's cbs sports sunday show at 11 a m for brown the assignment he didn't want turned out to be one of the most rewarding things he's ever done the best part he said was making new friends he called it emotional bonding i'd gladly do it again brown said the climb was the idea of jim benson of newport beach who is president of a los angeles executive benefits consulting company three years ago benson also a member of the special olympics board organized a bike ride across america by a group of 25 mentally disabled people twelve mentally disabled californians ranging in age from 19 to 30, went on the kilimanjaro venture accompanied by a coach for each and an independent film crew headed by emmy award-winning producer mike tollin benson's goal is to show the world as the special olympics creed states that ordinary people can do extraordinary things sunday's tv special is titled let me be brave which is a takeoff on the special olympics motto let me win but if i can not win let me be brave in the attempt mount kilimanjaro at 19,342 feet is africa's highest mountain and is 5,000 feet higher than any mountain in the united states excepting alaska kilimanjaro is located about 150 miles south of nairobi on the border between kenya and tanzania the group left feb 15, and five of the 12 athletes their coaches two cameramen and two soundmen made it to the top on feb 22 most of the group were sent back to base camp in arusha tanzania after the worst snowstorm in more than 20 years hit while the expedition was at about 16,000 feet six of the 12 were picked to continue but one diane hall of santee the youngest at 19 and the only woman became ill and could not continue one who did make it to the top joe hayden 22, of westmorland at first said he didn't want to go on without brown his new friend said brown he told me he was scared and wanted me to accompany him but the organizers thought it best if i didn't we hugged and he told me he was going to make the climb for me the group that continued to the summit returned to base camp a day after the others producer tollin said when the two groups were reunited the emotion was unbelievable there was no jealousy about who got to go on and who didn't only about 25 of the people who attempt to climb kilimanjaro make it to the top this group did better than that despite terrible weather conditions here were people who had been told about limitations all their lives tollin said but as a group they had shown what they could do it didn't matter which individuals had made it to the top they had accomplished
