THE general election result and new tax incentives led to the highest sales of unit trusts for 12 months , according to figures released today by the Unit Trust Association , John Authers writes . Total sales in April were Pounds 1bn , while the total number of unit trust accounts held rose for the first time since June 1990 . Net sales , at Pounds 252.6m , were greater than for the entire first quarter , and reached their highest level since last September . Funds under management grew to Pounds 59.36bn , the highest figure since October , up from Pounds 55.98bn in March . This was also aided by the strong stock market performance in the weeks after the election . Increased tax concessions announced in the Budget for unit trust investment via Personal Equity Plans ( Peps ) also encouraged smaller investors into the market . Mr Norman Lamont increased the amount that can be invested annually in unit trust Peps from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000 .
