What do you mean the election is over ? No more negative ad campaigns ? No more back-stabbing , mudslinging `` I'm- gon na clean-up-this-state '' rhetoric ? No more candidates versus the big corporation , greedy land-developing , old-boy network toxic polluters ? Oh , what will I do ? Same thing I did last election -- not vote out of disgust !
