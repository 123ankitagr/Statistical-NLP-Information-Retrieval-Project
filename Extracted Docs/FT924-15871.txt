NCM , the Dutch export credit group that last year acquired the short-term trade finance business of Britain 's Export Credits Guarantee Department ( ECGD ) , is to take control of short-term export insurance in Sweden following the collapse of Svenska Kredit , the country 's only private export credit insurer . The agreement to bail out Svenska Kredit provides urgently needed relief to Swedish exporters , who were threatened with the prospect of being unable to obtain export insurance cover by the end of October . Svenska Kredit is understood to have collapsed largely because of defaulting property loans . Its export credit business , which accounted for the lion 's share of its SKr338m ( Pounds 41m ) premium income in 1991 , is reportedly sound . NCM will provide cover through a new company , called NCM Kreditforsakring . It will not provide political risk cover , nor cover for contracts of more than three years duration . These will be referred to the country 's government-controlled export credit agency , Exportkreditnannden ( EKN ) . In the UK , the ECGD has agreed to provide loans totalling Dollars 45m to help finance Airbuses to Ivory Coast , Tunisia and Greece . This represents Britain 's 20 per cent share of the finance element of the deals , involving two Airbus A310-300s to Air Afrique , an A320 for Tunisair , and an A310-600 for Olympic Airways . ANZ Bank has been awarded the mandate to arrange the USDollars 100m financing for a new international airport in the Portuguese colony of Macao . Finance will involve credits supported by the ECGD in the UK , Hermes in Germany , Eximbank in the US , EFIC in Australia and COSEC , Portugal 's export credit insurer . The contract for the airport terminal has been awarded to the German-owned Siemens , and Soares de Costa of Portugal .
