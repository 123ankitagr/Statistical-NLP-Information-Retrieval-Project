HOUSE prices in the UK fell by a seasonally adjusted 1.2 per cent in May , according to the Halifax House Price Index . Prices had risen 1.4 per cent in March and 1.7 per cent in April . House prices are now 3.3 per cent below a year ago , compared to last month 's figure of 2.3 per cent down on the year . But figures from the Nationwide building society this week showed a 1 per cent rise in house prices in May , with prices down 5.5 per cent from a year ago . The Halifax said that the housing market showed clear signs of recovery , but warned that realistic prices were still necessary to generate house sales . The Halifax predicts a gradual recovery in 1993 , becoming more sustained in 1994 , when house prices should grow broadly in line with earnings as a whole .
