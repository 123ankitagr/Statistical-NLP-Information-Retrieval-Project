bid channel nine of australia wants to know how manchester will cope with the stigma of being the only loser bidding this time mr scott remarks that britain does not change its bidding cities like we change our underwear a barb aimed at previous bids from brisbane and melbourne in any case he says barcelona started bidding in 1924 but he acknowledges that manchester has to deal with its unglamorous image in a competition where its main rival has a famous harbour opera house and bridge in a picture postcard competition the free trade hall would not be in the running being an unglamorous candidate we have to become desirable we have to prove ourselves he says within the uk and especially in the southeast corner of england manchesters traditional image is of a damp postindustrial city where it rains much of the time and there is a lot of crime the optimists argue that the manchester rain would not have much affect on the games 80 per cent of olympic sports take place indoors the pessimists say it is the track and field events which people remember and which are the big pull for television and ticket sales the rain argument is being conducted with some ferocity with the bids supporters producing rainfall figures to show that the julyaugust period is no rainier in manchester than anywhere else and arguing that the citys climate makes it the ideal place for records to be broken in the millennium games mr tony blenman sports officer olympics of the british council says the image can be turned round manchester has a temperate climate and its postindustrial condition means there is a mature and thriving business community that can fund a new city and the infrastructure to support it the british council relocated last year from london to a

about manchester 2000 but there are difficulties the council has no budget for this kind of activity and is suffering staff and budget cuts the manchester bid does not have the resources to help out he and others concerned with manchesters image know that many britons who travel abroad and who may be discussing the manchester bid have never visited the city and have an impression based on historic perceptions and coronation street mr bob scott the bid director points out that peoples concerns about manchester vary a londoner may be concerned about dirt smoke and rain a francophone african may be more concerned about its being cold and about people not speaking french it is concerns such as these that the bid committee addresses when ioc delegates are visiting he insists that the job is to destroy misconceptions rather than to improve the image he says the ioc members who visited in 198990 to assess the abortive bid for the 1996 games were pleasantly surprised when they returned this year they saw that a lot had been done the new airport terminal built the metrolink integrated rail system built salford quays redeveloped the victoria arena velodrome and a concert hall under construction by september when the bid decision is made 71 of the 91 ioc members will have visited manchester he admits that there is always going to be a question mark about terrorism in
