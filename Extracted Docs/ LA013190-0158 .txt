A Miami woman is suing Julio Iglesias on the grounds that he defrauded her of royalties from a song they wrote together . Grecia ( Mimi ) Korman wants $ 50,000 in damages , plus interest , court costs and attorney fees . Korman says that in 1978 Iglesias asked her to help write a Spanish adaptation of the French song `` J'ai Oublie de Vivre '' ( `` I 've Forgotten to Live '' ) . She says she worked with some of his preliminary lyrics and a month later presented him with a finished product . The song appeared on at least seven albums with Korman and Iglesias listed as co-writers , but Korman says Iglesias entered into a contract with the French publishers of the song , presenting himself as the sole writer .
