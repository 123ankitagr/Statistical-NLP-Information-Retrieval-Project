Columbia Savings & Loan Assn . chief Thomas Spiegel said today he would quit as chairman and chief executive on Dec. 31 , blaming the collapsing junk bond market that has sent the Beverly Hills-based thrift reeling . Under the leadership of Spiegel , a former Wall Street trader , Columbia had invested more heavily than any other thrift in junk bonds , and turned big profits on them until recently . Its assets zoomed from $ 400 million in 1974 to more than $ 13 billion this year . He said he would become a consultant to Columbia , devoting all his time to creating a subsidiary into which the high-yield , high-risk securities can be spun off , and allowing a new leader to recreate Columbia as a more traditional lender . Under new laws , thrifts can invest in junk bonds only through separately capitalized affiliates rather than using government-insured deposits . Columbia also said that because of problems with those investments , it will be unable to meet the tougher requirements for risk-based capital contained in the thrift bailout bill signed in August by President Bush . Spiegel , who was paid $ 5.6 million in 1987 and $ 4.1 million last year , said the soured junk-bond market made his full-time attention to creating the new subsidiary a matter of urgency . Columbia said it already had begun interviewing potential successors . Spiegel , a friend of junk bond wizard Michael Milken , angered federal thrift regulators for years by amassing Columbia 's huge portfolio of junk bonds . He also is known for his close ties to political figures , and set up the junk bond investment for former House Majority Whip Tony Coelho that forced the Democrat to resign last May .
