RESIDENTIAL telephone users across much of the UK will soon be able to access the Mercury network without buying new phones , under Mercury 's new '132 ' service . Called 'easy access ' , users connected to the service will simply have to prefix the number they wish to dial with '132 ' to route their call via Mercury . The service is already available for London customers connected to digital exchanges - about half of all users in the capital . Users in Birmingham , Nottingham , Glasgow , Edinburgh , Oxford , and 17 other towns and cities are also eligible as of now . The annual connection fee is Pounds 10 ( plus VAT ) . It takes about two days to join ; there is no need to adjust your existing phone ( s ) . As yet Mercury has barely publicised '132 ' . An advertising blitz is scheduled for the autumn , by when just under half of existing BT residential customers will be able to switch to Mercury via '132 ' . Many long-distance and international calls are cheaper with Mercury , though users should also watch out for BT special offers . A '132 ' connection does not involve severing your existing BT link ; indeed all calls not prefaced by '132 ' will automatically be routed via BT . Mercury 's existing blue-button '131 ' service will run in parallel with '132' and remain the only means of access for those not connected to digital exchanges . However , from the end of the year manufacturers intend to start marketing blue-button '132 ' phones , which will route '132 ' calls via Mercury at the touch of one , instead of three , buttons .
