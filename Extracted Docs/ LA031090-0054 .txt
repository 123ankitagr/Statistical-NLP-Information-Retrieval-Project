point loma high schools girls are playing for the southern california division ii basketball championship today as news goes this is dogbitesman stuff a regional final without point lomas girls would be like donald trump without an ego jack mckeon without a cigar or lee hamilton without an opinion in other words it just doesnt happen this is our seventh time in eight years said coach lee trepanier who has coached basketballs version of the pointer sisters to 335 victories and a mere 50 losses over 15 years just think were one game away from state again and coach t as they call him was marveling at the thought as though in awe obviously each time is as nice as the times before that one game point loma needs to win to get to the state final again will be against pasadena muir at 130 in the los angeles sports arena win today and the kids get a chance to hang still one more state championship banner along the wall of the campus gym up there on chatsworth boulevard there are four there already muir however represents an interesting footnote in the recent history of point loma girls basketball in december 1985 to be precise muir beat point loma in one of those holiday tournament games point loma had won 62 consecutive games before that loss and 74 consecutive games after it accounting for a tidy record of 1361 over a stretch of five seasons muir in this sense was like the pitcher who stopped joe dimaggios streak those of course were different teams and different players successful coaches with successful programs are able to sustain through the inevitable transitions which might be more volatile on the high school level than anywhere else obviously trepanier qualifies as a successful coach running a successful program understand that he might not win many popularity contests north of i8 or east of i5 or south of rosecrans his detractors insist his players arrive literally by the busload from other areas in the san diego district so what the busing program is tied into the district curriculum to hear others read that losers tell it the guy brings his players to school in limousines paying this juggernaut a visit thursday night i expected to find little miss showtime just roll out the basketball and turn em loose naturally they would be tall fast and flashy jack nicholson might even be there to watch surprisingly they looked more like they came out of a biology class their warmup jerseys had nicknames such as untouchable stretch rocko mighty jo and ebay lok as well as some less imaginative real names such as davis stacy moss and neves when the game began i could see why neves would choose her own name rather than a nickname claudine neves was nothing but serious she was the point guard running the offense and her determination and discipline seemed to define the work ethic of the team in fact this was far from a flashanddash aggregation the word that comes to mind is gritty both point loma and its opponent la quinta went into the game with 283 records point loma had its star tyeast untouchable brown and la quinta had its star amy jalewalia and what they did was virtually neutralize each other however jalewalias teammates were getting the best of browns point loma looked like it was going anywhere but to another southern california championship game it made only one of 16 shots in the first quarter and five of 30 in the half given those numbers one might assume the pointers trailed by maybe 20 points not exactly that dirty d word defense kept them close with la quintas players hanging all over brown like christmas ornaments point loma came up with another hero for the occasion robin rocko rabello made big baskets at the end of the second and third quarters to keep it close and yet another with seven seconds to play in the game to provide the comfort zone in what was finally an uncomfortable 3936 victory rabello of course is yet another of those madetoplaybasketball kids trepanier is so lucky to get not exactly she is a senior who came into the season with three soccer letters and zero basketball letters she simply kept her wits about her and got the job done indeed what struck me in watching this game was that all these girls remained calm and controlled even when things were bleak and time was getting short and this was definitely a game that could have gotten away it was easy to understand why point lomas girls will be playing in their seventh southern california regional championship game in eight years because lee trepanier will be coaching his seventh regional championship game in eight years
