not one lead producer in the world was making a profit at present market prices said mr stephen briggs analyst at the metals minerals research services consultancy group after the metal fell on the london metal exchange yesterday to its lowest level for 6 1 2 years in real terms the price of lead had never been so low he suggested mmrs estimated that the average cost of producing refined lead was 23 or 24 cents a lb compared with yesterday's price of about 18 cents the lead market's problems like those of many other metals stem from a surge in exports from the former eastern bloc countries particularly from russia these countries traditionally were net importers of lead statistics from the international lead and zinc study group indicate that net eastern bloc exports last year reached about 130,000 tonnes more than double the 63,000 tonnes in 1991 historically the lead market has always been roughly in balance so this is a huge surplus for the metal mr briggs pointed out mr angus macmillan research manager at billiton-enthoven metals part of the royal dutch shell group suggested there would be no let up in eastern bloc exports this year and demand for lead remains uninspiring in all the metal's major consuming regions about 65 per cent of refined lead is used in batteries and while the us vehicle market was recovering european demand was flat he expected the 1993 lead supply surplus to remain about 150,000 tonnes both mr briggs and mr macmillan said they expected some substantial production cuts before long but mr briggs warned there will be no substantial price rise until we see a solid sustained increase in demand lead is still quoted in sterling on the lme and last night metal for delivery in three months closed at pounds 275.50 a tonne down another pounds 2
