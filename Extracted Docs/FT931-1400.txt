NOT ONE lead producer in the world was making a profit at present market prices , said Mr Stephen Briggs , analyst at the Metals & Minerals Research Services consultancy group , after the metal fell on the London Metal Exchange yesterday to its lowest level for 6 1/2 years . In real terms , the price of lead had never been so low , he suggested . MMRS estimated that the average cost of producing refined lead was 23 or 24 cents a lb compared with yesterday 's price of about 18 cents . The lead market 's problems , like those of many other metals , stem from a surge in exports from the former eastern bloc countries , particularly from Russia . These countries traditionally were net importers of lead . Statistics from the International Lead and Zinc Study Group indicate that net eastern bloc exports last year reached about 130,000 tonnes , more than double the 63,000 tonnes in 1991 . 'Historically the lead market has always been roughly in balance , so this is a huge surplus for the metal , ' Mr Briggs pointed out . Mr Angus MacMillan , research manager at Billiton-Enthoven Metals , part of the Royal Dutch/Shell group , suggested there would be no let up in eastern bloc exports this year and 'demand for lead remains uninspiring in all the metal 's major consuming regions . ' About 65 per cent of refined lead is used in batteries and , while the US vehicle market was recovering , European demand was flat . He expected the 1993 lead supply surplus to remain about 150,000 tonnes . Both Mr Briggs and Mr MacMillan said they expected some substantial production cuts before long . But Mr Briggs warned : 'There will be no substantial price rise until we see a solid , sustained increase in demand ' . Lead is still quoted in sterling on the LME and last night metal for delivery in three months closed at Pounds 275.50 a tonne , down another Pounds 2 .
