US negotiators admitted last night that little progress had been made in the latest round of high-level talks with North Korea on Pyongyang 's suspect nuclear programme , writes Frances Williams in Geneva . Mr Robert Gallucci , chief US negotiator , and Mr Kang Sok-ju , North Korea's first deputy foreign minister , plan to meet again on Tuesday , according to North Korean officials . Mr Gallucci said only that he would meet Mr Kang again next week . Technical experts will stay in Geneva to continue the week-long talks , which centre on a US offer to help North Korea switch from graphite-moderated to light-water reactors , which produce less plutonium . Among the sticking points are a North Korean demand for hefty compensation to abandon its current reactor programme .
