fifty per cent of all calls made are for one-way communication only but they often interrupt work which is more important than the call itself so says nigel harte business manager for voice products at mercury communications irritation at these interruptions is helping to increase the take up of answering machines voice messaging and voice processing the latest models of answering machine come complete with cordless phone and some provide an electronic handshake between base station and handset for extra security cordless answering machines are expensive in the uk dixons the high-street electrical retailer sells two models one from south western bell for pounds 149.99 and one from panasonic for pounds 179.99 this compares with pounds 29.99 for its cheapest non-cordless machine from betacom on standard answering machines popular features include automatic dating and timing of messages by a computer-generated voice the ability to switch the machine on remotely and toll saver available on panasonic's pounds 59.99 easa-phone and some others if the easa-phone does not pick up the call on the fourth ring the owner should hang up because there are no messages backlash against voice messaging for the corporate environment voice messaging systems offer many more features than answering machines but all too often they are implemented using the answering machine as a model in the us this has led to something of a backlash against voice messaging for example the chief executive of first union corporation made news when he sent a memo banning his company's voice messaging system after his call to a senior manager was greeted with a recorded message his memo won applause from employees who also hated the system since then the voice messaging industry has taken steps to make sure the systems are used more effectively in july 1992, leading voice messaging manufacturers and service providers including at t british telecom mobile octel communications corporation and vmx inc formed the voice messaging educational committee vmec and this year the committee has published a us market survey voice messaging a vital link in business communications and a booklet on voice mail etiquette at their simplest voice mail systems allow callers to leave a message if the person they want to talk to is not available by dialing the appropriate voice mailbox number and a code users can play messages back or forward them to another mailbox but if a voice messaging system is poorly implemented the customer may simply get passed from voice mailbox to voice mailbox or from menu of options to menu of options this frustrating state is known as voice mail jail because the caller feels trapped in the system the etiquette guide suggests tell callers how they can easily reach someone live if their call is urgent in fact the current trend in the us is to use the systems to augment the work of humans rather than as an excuse for firing the receptionist there are two main types of voice messaging system public services sometimes linked to a special voice mail phone number offered by telecoms carriers such as british telecom and mercury and premises-based systems where a company buys voice messaging equipment for use with the in-house phone system researchers bis mackintosh say there will be 1.4 m public voice mail users in europe on fixed and mobile systems by the end of the year rising to 5.4 m in 1997 meanwhile premises-based systems have grown 70 per cent a year between 1991 and 1993 in the uk the profile of public voice messaging is increasing largely because cellular phone operators such as cellnet vodafone and one-2-one from mercury provide voice mailboxes linked to users mobile phones visual voice mailboxes as well as spreading to mobile phone users voice messaging technologies are moving to the desktop and becoming integrated with other forms of communication such as electronic mail and fax according to elaine cascio a consultant at us voice systems consultancy vanguard for example products are emerging which allow a list of voice messages to be viewed on a personal computer particular messages can then be selected and played back on the pc if it has voice capabilities or through the phone suppliers which have or are developing integrated products for the desktop include vmx octel communications c3 applied technology active voice and converse apart from voice messaging there are two other types of voice system audiotex used for 0898 recorded information such as racing results and voice processing or interactive voice response voice processing is the type of technology used in telephone-based home banking systems it might for example prompt the user to press one to order a cheque book press two for your bank balance in essence these systems link a voice interface to a computer database they allow customers to input and retrieve information using a touch-tone phone the technology is often used in financial applications in the us it is also used extensively to order goods publicised on the qvc home shopping channel in fact qvc's system tootie has done a lot to expose consumers to voice response interest is growing in europe too cascio says us voice response suppliers are experiencing 57 per cent growth in europe with much of this growth coming from pc-based or client-server systems integration with fax according to robin scurlock head of bis mackintosh's messaging programme one of the main drivers in the voice systems market is integration with fax for example octel communications sells a fax store and-forward product in the us which enables a caller to a voice mailbox to leave a voice message as well as transmit a fax into the mailbox where it is stored on disk the voice message can be collected in the usual way and the fax can be routed to a nearby fax machine by using the phone handset to give details of the fax number to the mailbox integration is also evident in fax-on-demand products which enable users to phone a supplier use touch tone prompts to indicate which product service they are interested in and then key in their fax number to get the details faxed to them companies using fax-on-demand in the uk include compaq and advanstar organisers of the recent voice 93 show held in london and in the us there are many bureaux that use fax-on-demand technology to send out companies brochures charging on a monthly or per item basis fax-on-demand could be the ideal form of one-way communication no-one gets interrupted and the fax starts to be sent before the caller puts down the phone copies of making the most of voice mail a guide to voice mail etiquette are available from any vmec member-company or from vanguard communications on us 201 605 8000
