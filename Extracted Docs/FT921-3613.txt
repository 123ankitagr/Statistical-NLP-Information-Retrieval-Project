THE LONG-TERM debt of Lonrho , the international trading group , was yesterday accorded a rating three notches below investment grade by Moody 's , the US rating agency , writes Richard Waters . The unsolicited rating of Ba3 , which Lonrho said had been produced without its co-operation , applies to approximately Dollars 360m of Eurobonds issued by Lonrho Finance and Lonrho International Finance . Moody 's explained its rating by pointing to the group 's 'heavy use of debt , its relatively low cash-flow generating capabilities and the likely increased volatility of its future operating cash-flow and earnings . ' Mr Paul Spicer , a Lonrho director , said Moody 's rating betrayed a lack of understanding of the group 's business , adding : 'We have already set ourselves the task of reducing our gearing , if that is what they are getting at . ' Lonrho recently surprised the market with poor results for 1991 .
