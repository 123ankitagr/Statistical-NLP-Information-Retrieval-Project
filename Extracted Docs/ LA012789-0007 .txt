that the fire marshal had closed down the seating at 260 too bad because everyone had a wonderful time and only blue ribbon members no guests no hubbies can attend the nancy reagan morning kudos frank frank sinatra that is who wednesday night was honored with the will rogers award at the beverly hills diamond jubilee gala if you werent invited you can catch it on tv in february but pity poor george schlatter the shows producer who probably is going to have to leave the best bits on the cutting room floor none of this can be used on television don rickles announced well into his act who cares george schlatter is looking for anything two minutes six seconds sinatras buddies just had too good a time at the blacktie gala george hamilton who pulled up his tux legs and did his julio iglesias imitation sinatra crony jilly rizzo who announced that he didnt usually show up at all without a subpoena the always glamorous angie dickinson comedian tom dreesen who announced frank sinatra punched every man will rogers ever liked and sinatra himself who turned a mixup with cue cards into a very funny bit including the line will rogers never met dan rather the teleprompter had read geraldo rivera but sinatra did a switch there were sinatra and schlatter star buddies like joan collins lucille ball paul and ann anka allan carr lee remick charlton heston coastal commissioner mark nathanson with valerie perrine producer gary pudney with joanne carson and donna mills with her very very steady tony coleman there was only a smattering of beverly hills social types like ellen and bernie byrens henry and sedge plitt and business types warren ackerman the bistros kurt niklas the grills bob spivak theodores herb fink and don and arletta tronstein and back from washington jerry and jane weintraub ella fitzgerald sang and brought the entire place to its collective feet as for glitches the bev hills hotel picked up the tab for the night but if the evening was supposed to be a public relations ploy hurrah for the lobster appetizer but someone should have checked the veal with the coats also a guest list was released that not only gave the names of the folks who showed up but included the vips who didnt make it like former president gerald and betty ford mayor tom and ethel bradley terri garr fred hayman and sen pete and gayle wilson showing up were former ambassador bill

heiferman oh yes and also there was vanity fairs caroline cushing graham with billy hitchcock who of course is a close relative of tommy hitchcock one of the dashing polo players who long ago gave the beverly hills hotels polo lounge its pizazz and personality prison party thats right it was the grand ballroom of the regent beverly wilshire tuesday night but benefit cochair lynne wasserman and the magic of the disney studios had totally transformed it for the premiere of three fugitives benefiting the california institute of the arts and if calarts is supposed to be unorthodox unusual and unique so was the party gone were the banquet tables the formality the standard hotel fare there was a guy with a cart with dove bars long buffet tables with mexican food and fruit and cheese waiters in prison garb there were western bars there was also a lot of political talk thats because disney exec frank wells and his wife luanne were there and of course there is the constant talk that wells will be making his first run soon for a major office as well as backtoharvard law professor susan estrich the former dukakis campaign manager with her husband disney exec marty kaplan shes commuting and spending every weekend in california benefit cochairmen jeffrey and marilyn katzenberg were on hand but absent were cochairmen michael and jane eisner and michael and judy ovitz too bad they
