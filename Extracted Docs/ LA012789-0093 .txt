The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court asking that American Cablevision of Kansas City , Mo. , re-establish its public access channel so that the Ku Klux Klan can broadcast a white supremacist program called `` Klansas City . '' The City Council eliminated the public access station last year rather than broadcast the Missouri Knights of the Ku Klux Klan 's program . In its place , the cable company established a community access channel over which it exercises editorial control . The lawsuit says the council 's decision was motivated by the desire to suppress the viewpoint of the Klan . Councilman John Sharp said the City Council welcomes the suit `` because it was our intention to set a precedent that could be followed by other cities throughout the nation . The issue is whether the city has the right to require every cable television subscriber to subsidize the Klan 's propaganda . '' Dick Kurtenbach , executive director for the local ACLU chapter , said his organization found the Klan 's white supremacist ideology abhorrent and believed Klan members should be prosecuted if they used a television show to incite violence or other criminal activity . However , he said , `` our client here is the First Amendment . The Klan is only the vehicle . ''
