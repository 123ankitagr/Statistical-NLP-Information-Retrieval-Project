Amanda Walzer , out of the Grant High lineup for nearly a month because of bruised ribs , showed no sign of rust in leading the Lancers to a 2-1 win over San Pedro in a girls ' City Section semifinal soccer match Wednesday at Daniels Field in San Pedro . Walzer , a junior striker , scored both Grant goals , the second on a sweeping kick from 20 yards with 12 minutes remaining . `` She really played well , she surprised everybody , '' Grant Coach Frank Ortiz said of Walzer , the Lancers ' leading scorer who had not played since crashing into a goal post in a match three weeks ago . `` That lifted us , her coming out and showing so much determination . '' The Lancers ( 12-2-2 ) will meet undefeated Chatsworth on Saturday for the City championship . The site of the match has not been determined . Grant finished second to Chatsworth in the Northwest Valley Conference during the regular season . San Pedro ends its season 12-1-2 . Walzer scored seven minutes into the first half . After outrunning San Pedro 's coverage , Walzer went one on one with goalie Elisa De La Pena and scored on a shot into the right side of the net . San Pedro 's Chellee Bennett scored on the rebound of a missed shot five minutes later for her team 's only goal .
