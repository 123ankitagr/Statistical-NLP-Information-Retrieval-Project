Although dogs and cats comprise by far the majority of creatures with which county animal shelter officials must deal , they are far from the entire story . From the rather more commonplace to the strange , they include rabbits , birds , opossums , skunks , raccoons , snakes , squirrels , deer , guinea pigs , gophers , coyotes , ducks , rats , tortoises , moles , weasels , monkeys , wallabies , iguanas and ferrets .
