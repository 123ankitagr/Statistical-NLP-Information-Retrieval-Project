An inert fluid which is used as a dressing to treat burns is now being used in the electronics industry to prevent the latest processor chips from over-heating . As consumers demand increasing power packed into smaller packages - from laptop PCs to cameras - many microprocessors have had difficulty working at their full capacity without overheating . Oasis has been developed by Aavid , of Laconia , New Hampshire , to dissipate the heat . Oasis incorporates a fluid developed by 3M which boils at between 56 ' C and 58 ' C and is intended for use where there is a minimal amount of space above the microprocessor . As the liquid boils it vaporises and then is carried away to a condenser where it turns back into liquid . Aavid : US , 603 528 3400 .
