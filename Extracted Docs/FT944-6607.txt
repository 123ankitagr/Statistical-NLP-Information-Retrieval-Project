cancer continues sink claws deeper mankind after two decades war cancer fuelled billions research dollars death toll rises inexorably the disease named latin word crab crablike pattern made blood vessels growing tumour kill estimated 25m people industrialised world year that amounts almost quarter deaths the gloomy mortality statistics contrast excitement among cancer researchers made progress towards understanding fundamental processes responsible disease past 15 years previous history the important question present future cancer patients quickly new knowledge converted better diagnosis treatment at present gap doctors continuing inability provide much palliative care millions cancer patients cascade optimistic stories popular media breakthroughs research discovering cancer genes inventing experimental drugs there inevitable delay typically decade advance medical science developed commercial application so one expect latest discoveries made clinical impact yet but many people remember breakthroughs 1970s early 1980s interferon magic bullet antibodies would transformed cancer treatment lived first expectations very patients treated novel approaches derived biotechnology the vast majority still undergo wellestablished procedures chemotherapy poisoning cancer cells drug cocktail radiotherapy destroying radiation surgery also used cut solid tumours we hear word breakthrough thrown around much says nicholas wright clinical director imperial cancer research fund london certainly get impression public bit jaundiced scientists talking breakthroughs why people contracting dying cancer the first reason epidemic cancers caused smoking particularly lung cancer at least 30 per cent cancer deaths tobaccorelated says archie turnbull executive secretary genevabased uicc umbrella body worlds cancer charities a second fundamental reason cancer mainly disease old age as medicine becomes successful preventing early deaths illnesses heart attacks strokes people living beyond age 70 risk cancer rises rapidly despite overall rise cancer mortality substantial improvements areas the encouraging feature statistics since 1970s progress curing cancers children young adults particularly leukaemia hodgkins disease testicular cancer new drug combinations the number children age 15 dying cancer fallen half there two principal reasons young people responding readily treatment one youthful cancer cells blood lymph systems physically easier reach destroy drugs andor radiation solid tumours middleaged elderly another reason difference proliferating cancer cells normal cells greater childhood cancers slowergrowing adult tumours therefore chemotherapy radiotherapy work damaging dna cell division destroy cancer cells without causing unacceptable sideeffects prospects curing big killers tumours lungs bowels stomach breast prostate pancreas depend developing treatments discriminate effectively cancer normal cells drugs used chemotherapy today the discovery genetic changes leading cancer make possible says gordon mcvie scientific director cancer research campaign these provide first time absolute chemical difference cells until rely qualitative differences cancer cells making rather proteins less others scientists identified 100 genes trigger cellular processes leading cancer mutate causes mutation include carcinogenic chemicals radiation family inheritance random changes cell division one dangerous type genetic change stimulates cell growth another shuts protective tumour suppressor genes normally prevent excessive proliferation the former compared car accelerator jammed latter failure brakes new approaches prevention diagnosis treatment cancer built differences genes diseased normal cells corresponding differences proteins produce one possibility block damaging effects abnormal growth factors sustain proliferation tumour cells without harming healthy cell growth but cancer genes reason researchers excited another new understanding way bodys immune system recognises attacks cancer cells this led experimental cancer vaccines boost immune response these novel biotech approaches cancer diagnosis treatment examined next six months financial times technology page so advances conventional chemotherapy radiotherapy the aim convey real optimism prevails laboratories hope expectation cancer eventually restricted
