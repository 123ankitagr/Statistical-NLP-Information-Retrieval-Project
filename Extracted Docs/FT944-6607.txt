cancer continues to sink its claws deeper into mankind after two decades of war on cancer fuelled by billions of research dollars the death toll rises inexorably the disease named after the latin word for crab because of the crablike pattern made by blood vessels on a growing tumour will kill an estimated 25m people in the industrialised world this year that amounts to almost a quarter of all deaths the gloomy mortality statistics contrast with excitement among cancer researchers who have made more progress towards understanding the fundamental processes responsible for the disease over the past 15 years than in all previous history the important question for present and future cancer patients is how quickly the new knowledge can be converted into better diagnosis and treatment at present there is a gap between doctors continuing inability to provide much more than palliative care for millions of cancer patients and the cascade of optimistic stories in the popular media about breakthroughs in research such as discovering cancer genes and inventing experimental drugs there is an inevitable delay typically a decade or so while an advance in medical science is developed for commercial application so no one should expect the latest discoveries to have made any clinical impact yet but many people will remember breakthroughs from the 1970s and early 1980s such as interferon and magic bullet antibodies which would have transformed cancer treatment by now if they had lived up to first expectations very few patients are treated with novel approaches derived from biotechnology the vast majority still undergo the wellestablished procedures of chemotherapy poisoning cancer cells with a drug cocktail and radiotherapy destroying them with radiation surgery is also used to cut out solid tumours we hear the word breakthrough thrown around too much says nicholas wright clinical director of the imperial cancer research fund in london and we certainly get the impression that the public are a bit jaundiced by scientists talking about breakthroughs why are more people contracting and dying from cancer the first reason is an epidemic of cancers caused by smoking particularly lung cancer at least 30 per cent of all cancer deaths are tobaccorelated says archie turnbull executive secretary of the genevabased uicc an umbrella body for the worlds cancer charities a second more fundamental reason is that cancer is mainly a disease of old age as medicine becomes more successful at preventing early deaths from other illnesses such as heart attacks and strokes more people are living beyond the age of 70 above which the risk of cancer rises rapidly despite the overall rise in cancer mortality there have been substantial improvements in some areas the most encouraging feature of the statistics since the 1970s is the progress in curing cancers in children and young adults particularly leukaemia hodgkins disease and testicular cancer through new drug combinations the number of children under the age of 15 dying from cancer has fallen by half there are two principal reasons why young people are responding more readily to treatment one is that youthful cancer cells in the blood or lymph systems are physically easier to reach and destroy with drugs andor radiation than the solid tumours of the middleaged and elderly another reason is that the difference between proliferating cancer cells and normal cells is greater in childhood cancers than in slowergrowing adult tumours therefore chemotherapy and radiotherapy which work by damaging dna during cell division can destroy more cancer cells without causing unacceptable sideeffects prospects for curing the big killers tumours of the lungs bowels stomach breast prostate and pancreas depend above all on developing treatments that discriminate more effectively between cancer and normal cells than the drugs used in chemotherapy today the discovery of genetic changes leading to cancer should make this possible says gordon mcvie scientific director of the cancer research campaign these provide for the first time an absolute chemical difference between the cells until now we have had to rely on qualitative differences the cancer cells making rather more of some proteins and less of others scientists have identified more than 100 genes that can trigger the cellular processes leading to cancer if they mutate causes of mutation include carcinogenic chemicals radiation family inheritance and random changes during cell division one dangerous type of genetic change stimulates cell growth another shuts down the protective tumour suppressor genes which normally prevent excessive proliferation the former has been compared with a car that has its accelerator jammed on the latter with a failure in the brakes new approaches to the prevention diagnosis and treatment of cancer are being built on such differences between the genes of diseased and normal cells and the corresponding differences in the proteins they produce one possibility is to block the damaging effects of abnormal growth factors which sustain the proliferation of tumour cells without harming healthy cell growth but cancer genes are not the only reason why researchers are excited another is their new understanding of the way the bodys immune system recognises and attacks cancer cells this has led to experimental cancer vaccines to boost the immune response these novel biotech approaches to cancer diagnosis and treatment will be examined over the next six months on the financial times technology page so will advances in more conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy the aim is to convey the real optimism that now prevails in the laboratories a hope and expectation that cancer will eventually be restricted to a disease of the very old without raising excessive expectations about the speed and ease with which this will happen after 50 years in cancer research sir richard doll of
