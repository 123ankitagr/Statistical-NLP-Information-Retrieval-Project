jurassic park pg steven spielberg baraka pg ron fricke children of nature fridrik thor fridriksson here it is and was it worth the wait when you tell someone you have seen jurassic park back flies the mach-2 question what's it like this never means what it should mean what does it resemble but is it good is it bad will it scare the screaming daylights out of us let us take the question at first value jurassic park is like jaws meets westworld steven spielberg its director made the first and michael crichton its writer wrote and directed the second it is like a nightmare day out at the natural history museum and it is like a hollywood story conference where savage primeval pitches rend the air let's have the palaeontologist hero and the two kids climb the electrified fence let's have the heroine feel a comforting arm on her shoulder and then discover it's only an arm let's have the velociraptors run amok in the visitors centre kitchen let's have lord attenborough play the park's founder with a limp a scottish accent and a cherubic smile result sir richard resembles ronnie corbett gone awol in an hg wells novel yes but you still want to know what is it like well it is good it is bad and occasionally it scares the daylights out of us what is good is the hi-tech presumption of the film crichton's novel was a spinechiller-satire about an ultimate act of hubris a theme park packed with prehistoric fauna recreated through a far-fetched but not that far-fetched union of diy and dna mutinies against its masters drawn to the theme of techno-impudence steven spielberg makes a movie that is all techno-impudence jurassic park spreads its banquet of gewgaws gizmos and breakthrough graphics before us condemning previous dinosaur films to cinematic prehistory computer imaging and state-of-art modelwork ensure that when tyrannosaurus rex growls into frame to terrify dr sam neill and the two children he is escorting on an ill-fated preview tour of the park the said t rex is a glistening roaring tail-thrashing mother of all monsters with no hint of stop-motion jerk in fact no signs anywhere of the old clockwork epilepsy we knew and half-loved in gorgo and godzilla not in the raptors and iguanadons nor in the gentle triceratops tended by palaeo-botanist' laura dern nor in the puff-necked spitter that disposes of the villainous dennis wayne knight a park boffin who runs straight into death while smuggling stolen embryos to a waiting boat but if the monsters have evolved beyond stop-motion the human characters are a different story stereotypes made to fit a game-plan they stand about striking prescribed attitudes and between shots make small adjustments of gesture to present a fresh facet of the same cliche the palaeontologist must spout sandblown wisdom the chaos theory scientist jeff goldblum with chaos theory hair and scat speech-patterns must burble about things unravelling and the lady botanist must rail against sexist notions of female weakness one moment scream like fay wray the next in jaws spielberg painted an entire convincing new england community behind and around the foreground monster and in close encounters of the third kind he gave a messianic madness to the hero's love affair with the cosmic-impossible but in jurassic park the characters are prisoners of a theme park just like the dinosaurs only their theme park is called hollywood and their inventor-orchestrator is the box-office lowest-denominator thinking means that each character represents a big bland constituency for audience identification from the all-purpose egghead sceptic goldblum to the all-purpose damsel in distress mildly fuzzed by feminism dern only the actor saddled with the largest burden of cliches lord attenborough almost succeeds in throwing them off ever since he vanished behind a movie camera fans of sir dickie the actor have been crying for him to come forth again he is marvellous in jurassic park hammond the park's founder could have been a melodramatic cipher a science-tampering scoundrel out of fritz lang by dr no but attenborough gives him a foolish charm a sing-song passion even a wistful pain listen to the pure emotion he finds in a tinselly speech about his flea-circus past elsewhere the flimsiness of the people undoes even the ferocity of the beasts and spielberg the spielberg of et rather than jaws is not above making the monsters cuddly when there is a pause in the ravening for cuddlification comes with the territory all those covetable tie-in models toys games t-shirts gum-wrappers a chaos theory terror movie may be the promise but in jurassic park cosiness is always just around the corner as a lexicogapher friend pointed out what you really get when you extract dna from dinosaurs is the word souris jurassic park is a mouse with pretensions but such is the power of hype that no one will notice until only dollars 100 m to go it has become the highest-earning film ever made baraka is a film based upon the problematical notion that cinematic silence equals importance subtitled a world beyond words ron fricke's film is a 90-minute non-verbal collage of imagery that attempts to show the interconnectedness of life on the planet starting with a snow monkey dozing off in a hot spring fricke's film quickly goes cosmic presenting the viewer with a dizzying array of visual takes of smoldering volcanoes surging city crowds traditional religious ceremonies and clouds pouring over himalayan mountaintops occasionally this method provides memorable sequences such as the montage comparing assembly line work throughout the world that ends with the truly unsettling sight of live chicks tumbling down a stainless steel shoot on the way to becoming inmates at the egg factory and when fricke's 70 mm camera zooms in on small details an aboriginal man using a plastic comb to paint his face for instance he comes close to making his point but the film eventually collapses under its own portentousness particularly during a trip to auschwitz at times beautiful and arresting baraka is ultimately little more than a stylised exercise in global channel-hopping one of the few countries fricke does not visit is iceland given the starkly beautiful landscape of that country on view in children of nature you cannot help but feel he has missed something fridrik thor fridriksson's heartfelt second film details the last days of an elderly widower gisli halldorsson who abandons his farm for reykjavik only to have his daughter pack him off to an old folk's home there he meets a childhood sweetheart sigridur hagalin a proud and beautiful septuagenarian who wants to visit her birthplace on the island's desolate eastern region before dying their romance rekindles and equipped with a stolen jeep they set off across iceland followed by the police writer director fridriksson has fashioned a subtle sometimes moving film about people who will not go gently into the arctic night lovingly photographed and well acted children of nature avoids casting the elderly as cute curmudgeons however fridriksson fails to strike a consistent emotional tone moving too abruptly from unrelieved gloom to fantastical whimsy and the film's subtitles are replete with enough misspellings to keep the eye from fully enjoying those bleakly beautiful icelandic vistas
