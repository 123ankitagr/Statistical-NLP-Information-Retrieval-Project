jurassic park pg steven spielberg baraka pg ron fricke children of nature fridrik thor fridriksson here it is and was it worth the wait when you tell someone you have seen jurassic park back flies the mach2 question whats it like this never means what it should mean what does it resemble but is it goodis it badwill it scare the screaming daylights out of us let us take the question at first value jurassic park is like jaws meets westworld steven spielberg its director made the first and michael crichton its writer wrote and directed the second it is like a nightmare day out at the natural history museum and it is like a hollywood story conference where savage primeval pitches rend the air lets have the palaeontologist hero and the two kids climb the electrified fence lets have the heroine feel a comforting arm on her shoulder and then discover its only an arm lets have the velociraptors run amok in the visitors centre kitchen lets have lord attenborough play the parks founder with a limp a scottish accent and a cherubic smile result sir richard resembles ronnie corbett gone awol in an hg wells novel yes but you still want to know what is it like well it is good it is bad and occasionally it scares the daylights out of us what is good is the hitech presumption of the film crichtons novel was a spinechillersatire about an ultimate act of hubris a theme park packed with prehistoric fauna recreated through a farfetched but not that farfetched union of diy and dna mutinies against its masters drawn to the theme of technoimpudence steven spielberg makes a movie that is all technoimpudence jurassic park spreads its banquet of gewgaws gizmos and breakthrough graphics before us condemning previous dinosaur films to cinematic prehistory computer imaging and stateofart modelwork ensure that when tyrannosaurus rex growls into frame to terrify dr sam neill and the two children he is escorting on an illfated preview tour of the park the said t rex is a glistening roaring tailthrashing mother of all monsters with no hint of stopmotion jerk in fact no signs anywhere of the old clockwork epilepsy we knew and halfloved in gorgo and godzilla not in the raptors and iguanadons nor in the gentle triceratops tended by palaeobotanist laura dern nor in the puffnecked spitter that disposes of the villainous dennis wayne knight a park boffin who runs straight into death while smuggling stolen embryos to a waiting boat but if the monsters have evolved beyond stopmotion the human characters are a different story stereotypes made to fit a gameplan they stand about striking prescribed attitudes and between shots make small adjustments of gesture to present a fresh facet of the same cliche the palaeontologist must spout sandblown wisdom the chaos theory scientist jeff goldblum with chaos theory hair and scat speechpatterns must burble about things unravelling and the lady botanist must rail against sexist notions of female weakness one moment scream like fay wray the next in jaws spielberg painted an entire convincing new england community behind and around the foreground monster and in close encounters of the third kind he gave a messianic madness to the heros love affair with the cosmicimpossible but in jurassic park the characters are prisoners of a theme park just like the dinosaurs only their theme park is called hollywood and their inventororchestrator is the boxoffice lowestdenominator thinking means that each character represents a big bland constituency for audience identification from the allpurpose egghead sceptic goldblum to the allpurpose damsel in distress mildly fuzzed by feminism dern only the actor saddled with the largest burden of cliches lord attenborough almost succeeds in throwing them off ever since he vanished behind a movie camera fans of sir dickie the actor have been crying for him to come forth again he is marvellous in jurassic park hammond the parks founder could have been a melodramatic cipher a sciencetampering scoundrel out of fritz lang by dr no but attenborough gives him a foolish charm a singsong passion even a wistful pain listen to the pure emotion he finds in a tinselly speech about his fleacircus past elsewhere the flimsiness of the people undoes even the ferocity of the beasts and spielberg the spielberg of et rather than jaws is not above making the monsters cuddly when there is a pause in the ravening for cuddlification comes with the territory all those covetable tiein models toys games tshirts gumwrappers a chaos theory terror movie may be the promise but in jurassic park cosiness is always just around the corner as a lexicogapher friend pointed out what you really get when you extract dna from dinosaurs is the word souris jurassic park is a mouse with pretensions but such is the power of hype that no one will notice until only dollars 100m to go it has become the highestearning film ever made baraka is a film based upon the problematical notion that cinematic silence equals importance subtitled a world beyond words ron frickes film is a 90minute nonverbal collage of imagery that attempts to show the interconnectedness of life on the planet starting with a snow monkey dozing off in a hot spring frickes film quickly goes cosmic presenting the viewer with a dizzying array of visual takes of smoldering volcanoes surging city crowds traditional religious ceremonies and clouds pouring over himalayan mountaintops occasionally this method provides memorable sequences such as the montage comparing assembly line work throughout the world that ends with the truly unsettling sight of live chicks tumbling down a stainless steel shoot on the way to becoming inmates at the egg factory and when frickes 70mm camera zooms in on small details an aboriginal man using a plastic comb to paint his face for instance he comes close to making his point but the film eventually collapses under its own portentousness particularly during a trip to auschwitz at times beautiful and arresting baraka is ultimately little more than a stylised exercise in global channelhopping one of the few countries fricke does not visit is iceland given the starkly beautiful landscape of that country on view in children of nature you can not help but feel he has missed something fridrik thor fridrikssons heartfelt second film details the last days of an elderly widower gisli halldorsson who abandons his farm for reykjavik only to have his daughter pack him off to an old folks home there he meets a childhood sweetheart sigridur hagalin a proud and beautiful septuagenarian who wants to visit her birthplace on the islands desolate eastern region before dying their romance rekindles and equipped with a stolen jeep they set off across iceland followed by the police writerdirector fridriksson has fashioned a subtle sometimes moving film about people who will not go gently into the arctic night lovingly photographed and well acted children of nature avoids casting the elderly as cute curmudgeons however fridriksson fails to strike a consistent emotional tone moving too abruptly from unrelieved gloom to fantastical whimsy and the films subtitles are replete with enough misspellings to keep the eye from fully enjoying those bleakly beautiful icelandic vistas
