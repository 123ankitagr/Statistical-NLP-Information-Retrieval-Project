I have long believed that what keeps Los Angeles from universal recognition as a great city ( like Paris , London , Vienna and Chicago , to name only a few ) is our lack of a great river flowing through our urban center . Without such a river we do n't seem fully alive . But now Assemblyman Katz proposes to turn even our pathetic concrete excuse for a river into a freeway . Well , why not ? His additional ideas for flanking the new freeway with greenbelts , trees , bikeways and pocket parks sound wonderful . The next order of business , however , must be to dig up the Harbor Freeway and turn it into that great river we 've always deserved . Let the city planners fill in all the transit lines and new roads to keep the traffic moving -- no doubt the river itself will move people and goods more rapidly than the freeway ever did . And the postcards of the downtown skyscrapers reflected in the river will pay for the project in new tourism . PAUL SARGENT CLARK Hollywood
