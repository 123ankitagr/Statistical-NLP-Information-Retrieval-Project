i have long believed that what keeps los angeles from universal recognition as a great city like paris london vienna and chicago to name only a few is our lack of a great river flowing through our urban center without such a river we dont seem fully alive but now assemblyman katz proposes to turn even our pathetic concrete excuse for a river into a freeway well why not his additional ideas for flanking the new freeway with greenbelts trees bikeways and pocket parks sound wonderful the next order of business however must be to dig up the harbor freeway and turn it into that great river weve always deserved let the city planners fill in all the transit lines and new roads to keep the traffic moving no doubt the river itself will move people and goods more rapidly than the freeway ever did and the postcards of the downtown skyscrapers reflected in the river will pay for the project in new tourism paul sargent clark hollywood
