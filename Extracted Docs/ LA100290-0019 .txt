the rev jesse jackson is better at using the camera than talking to it yet his new weekly series airing at 5 pm sundays on kcal channel 9 and named of all things jesse jackson ranks among the most important additions to television in years not because jackson has sharpened his enunciation on the contrary for someone known for swaying crowds with fiery oratory he often slurs his words so badly that it takes all your concentration just to understand what hes saying not because hes skilled at interviewing and leading panel discussions he isnt as evidenced by sundays taped premiere which focused almost entirely on the status of north american indians not because his syndicated series is silky smooth it has kinks galore including an eclectic audience that didnt participate in sundays show or even make a sound it was nothing more than a multiracial backdrop a prop not because he totally sheds his selfserving personalpuffery cloak he said sunday that the mohawks protesting plans for a golf course on their ancient burial grounds in oka quebec invited us there to hear their story so cut to jackson being refused entry to the area by canadian troops cut to jackson holding an impromptu press conference there cut to jackson visiting a mohawk survivor school cut to jackson receiving a sweat shirt from the mohawks cut to jackson making a speech to them cut to jackson with canadas indian minister who tells jackson that he warned the local mayor not to go ahead with the golf course was the story the mohawks protest or jackson what gives jesse jackson so much promise is obviously none of the above what you love about it are its fresh eyes its jackson the reformer not jackson the performer who stars here thanks to him this show swims against the tv mainstream by giving voice to the voiceless in a medium known for its narrow range of opinion in news and publicaffairs programs just think about it rarely do indians get more than sound bites but on sunday they got almost the entire hour including a 15minute package in which indian activist russell means who led the wounded knee uprising in south dakota in 1973 visited three reservations where indians in the united states were said to be facing problems similar to those in oka hearing the earth described by american indians as our mother puts many of their conflicts with whites in context and these visual essays with means were an eloquent expression of the indian outlook next came jackson leading a panel discussion that included a treaties attorney means and two other indian leaders the federal bureau of indian affairs declined to participate he said in light of this and the discussions strong tilt jackson should have been a better devils advocate yet jesse jackson is intended to have a point of view and the indian views expressed here charges ranging from whites trampling on indian rights to institutionalized stereotyping are valid ones generally excluded from tv even with its flaws jesse jackson promises to be strikingly distinctive and valuable affirming this time that theres more than one civil rights struggle in the us
