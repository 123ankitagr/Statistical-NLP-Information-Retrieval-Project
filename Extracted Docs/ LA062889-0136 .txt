Donald Trump is fishing for another yacht , his 292-foot Trump Princess being too small for entertaining high rollers from his two booming Atlantic City casinos . The new super-yacht will cost about $ 140 million , the New York Post and New York Newsday reported today . Trump , a billionaire developer , said he 's accepting bids from boat builders for `` something in excess of 400 feet long , closer to 500 feet . '' Trump bought the Princess from the Sultan of Brunei for $ 29 million and refitted it at a cost of $ 10 million last year . The yacht , with 11 suites , 210 telephones , gold-plated fittings and a disco , was lampooned in the comic strip `` Doonesbury . ''
