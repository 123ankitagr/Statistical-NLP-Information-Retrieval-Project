mr jacques attali president of the european bank for reconstruction and development breakfasts with the deputy prime minister of an eastern european state lunches with bankers in another and then dines with a head of state several hundred miles away as he says himself the only way to keep up such a pace is to use a private jet one charter company in particular air entreprise based at le bourget near paris has been the beneficiary of mr attalis flights from london where the ebrd is based last year the ebrd paid fr688m pounds 739000 in terms of the exchange rates when the flights took place for 26 flights with air entreprise many to destinations wellserved by scheduled flights according to a detailed memorandum prepared by mr anders ljungh the banks finance director which has been obtained by the financial times only once in that year did the ebrd charter an aircraft from another operator that was for a trip to the baltic states of the former soviet union which did not involve mr attali the trip was organised by six ebrd directors each a civil servant representing the countries which own the bank that trip to the baltic states lasted six days and the jet provided by the charter company euroflite carried 10 passengers from the bank the cost of the expedition which included stops in helsinki vilnius riga tallin and st petersburg was pounds 8800 the banks directors have now asked why all but one of the trips with air entreprise cost more than that the expenditure on private jets is one of the main targets of the investigation into the banks financial management being carried out by the banks audit committee mr claes de neergaard a swedish government official who is chairman of the banks audit committee made a series of critical comments on the flights in a report dated may 7 the committee believed the use of special flights flights in charted aircraft should be scrutinised on the grounds of cost efficiency cost effectiveness and their impact on the banks image the committee was not satisfied that cost efficiency had been demonstrated especially where flights were to destinations wellserved by commercial airlines the committee expressed doubts as to the costeffectiveness as it appeared that special flights were often necessitated by an impractical agenda the committee expressed serious concern that during 1992 one company air entreprise had been used for all but one of the 27 flights one bank director said yesterday the audit committee would now carry out a forensic probe of the flights taken by mr attali the audit committee has received mr ljunghs synopsis of private jet flights in 1992 but this list does not give details of mr attalis schedule on those trips nor why air entreprise was chosen as carrier in its publicity material air
