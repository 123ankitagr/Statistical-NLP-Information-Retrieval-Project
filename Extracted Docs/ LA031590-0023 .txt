a desperately ill nurse from laguna hills was reported in critical but stable condition on wednesday after surgeons at uc san diego medical center completed the first combination heart-lung transplant ever attempted in san diego county catherine renee williams 34, a registered nurse at saddleback memorial medical center in laguna hills should be able to lead a normal life if her recovery continues smoothly dr paul jagger a medical center spokesman said wednesday williams was hospitalized in january for treatment of a relatively rare congenital heart defect that had caused severe and irreversible damage to her lungs it's safe to say that she had less than a year to live jagger said we're very pleased with her progress jagger said things went very smoothly for the first procedure of this type here oxygenation of the lungs is excellent as are cardiac functions doctors began the complex five-hour operation late tuesday night and completed it early wednesday morning jagger said williams on wednesday regained consciousness for a time and she was aware that she'd had the operation according to a family friend her doctors were ecstatic williams who was scheduled to remain in the recovery room for about 24 hours will stay in an intensive care ward for at least a week and be hospitalized for several more weeks jagger said she will remain on a continuous medication program that is designed to keep her body's immune system from rejecting the transplanted organs jagger said nationally 31 hospitals are conducting heart-lung transplants more than 800 of the operations have been conducted worldwide medical centers at ucsd stanford and ucla are the only california institutions to have completed heart-lung transplants cedar-sinai hospital and st vincent medical center in los angeles area have completed lung transplants but have not done combination heart-lung transplants ucsd's surgery team was led by dr stuart w jamieson who has directed or performed more than 50 heart-lung transplants while working at other facilities jagger said jamieson and his transplant team moved to ucsd last july from the minnesota heart and lung institute the transplant team includes drs michael p kaye jolene m kriett and riyad y tarazi and clinical nurse specialists ann hayden and rebecca robert nationally survival rates for patients who have undergone heart-lung transplants average about 60 jagger said jamieson's patients at the minnesota facility have a 75 survival rate jagger said williams was one of three patients awaiting heart-lung transplants at san diego hospitals both ucsd and sharp hospital recently created teams capable of performing heart-lung and lung transplants ucsd also has several patients awaiting lung transplants williams was placed on the heart-lung transplant list in january last october she was diagnosed as having eisenmenger's syndrome a rare congenital heart defect that ruins the lungs a hole between the two chambers of her heart caused it to pump harder than usual creating pressure that was gradually destroying her lungs jagger said eisenmenger's syndrome is almost always diagnosed in infancy or early childhood at that point it is possible to repair the heart and avoid irreversible damage to the patient's lungs because combination heart-lung donors are extremely rare williams physicians were ready to perform a complex operation involving the repair of williams heart and the transplantation of a single lung which is easier to obtain we were hoping that we could get at least one lung but we had the opportunity to get two lungs and a heart to go with it jagger said if only one lung had become available we would have tried to repair the congenital defect in the heart ucsd officials on wednesday declined to divulge any details about the donor the operation which cost about 150,000, was not covered by williams medical insurance policy according to michael stringer director of ucsd's hospitals and clinics however williams family friends and co-workers are sponsoring a fund-raising campaign that with matching funds from saddleback memorial has collected 118,000 the medical center is committed to cover any difference that remains jagger said by coincidence gary troxel who just weeks earlier became ucsd's first heart transplant patient was released on wednesday morning troxel a 25-year-old construction worker from riverside county is in good condition following the feb 26 operation jagger said this was an important day for san diego and the region stringer said it represents the availability of an important new medical program for critically ill patients ucsd's transplant program now includes hearts heart-lung combinations lungs corneas and bone marrow stringer said
