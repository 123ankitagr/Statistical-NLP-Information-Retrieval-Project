the timing ironic as 12000 researchers gathered recently society neurosciences annual meeting health human services secretary louis w sullivan extended indefinitely ban federally funded fetal tissue transplants the moratorium predominantly affects neuroscientists forbids federal support experimental transplants humans tissue intentionally aborted fetuses continuing ban initiated march 1988 reagan administration apply transplants animal fetal cells sullivan rejecting conclusions national institutes health advisory committee convened last year decided permitting human fetal research issue increase incidence abortion across country though extended ban angered many neuroscientists researchers conference shared wealth data novel experiments animals many involving transplants nonfetal nerve cells may day find application humans while neuroscientists doubt nonfetal cells ever match therapeutic potential fetal cells work stirs excitement among many researchers but whatever potential nonfetal substitutes fetal cells remain neuroscientists tissue choice some experiments indicate fetal tissue may prove valuable treating parkinsons disease alzheimers neurodegenerative conditions for example first us patient receive transplant 52yearold man 20year history parkinsons disease responded surgery significant improvements mobility reports curt r freed university colorado school medicine denver performed surgery private funds november 1988 the federal ban undoubtedly minimize number surgeries near future delaying conclusions procedures effectiveness humans freed said moreover privately funded us researchers continuing experiment human fetal cell transplants complain bitterly relegated status scientific renegades but economic political problems factors prompting neuroscientists seek alternatives human fetal cells the funding problems part stimulated people look alternatives would evolved even hadnt ban fetal tissues said fred h gage uc san diego were expanding horizons looking options gage colleagues recently demonstrated nonfetal cells show promise recently reported successfully transplanted genetically engineered ratskin cells called fibroblasts brains rats syndrome resembling parkinsons disease engineered secrete brain chemical dopamine found short supply parkinsons patients cells alleviated rats symptoms average 35 may hold potential treatment parkinsons said gage others these experiments described november proceedings national academy sciences researchers elsewhere experimenting nonfetal cells genealtered equally intriguing preliminary results for example many presentations years neuroscience meeting focused transplants fibroblasts genetically engineered produce substances nerve growth factor protein stimulates nerve regeneration these cells implanted brains rats suffering nerve damage stimulate neuronal repair other researchers transplanted young astrocytes starshaped central nervous system cells donor rats onto injured spinal cord tissue recipient rats astrocytes belong class called glial cells provide physical biochemical support neurons reports neuroscience meeting indicate transplanted astrocytes types glial cells appear improve coordination injured rats stimulating production nervenurturing substances around injury preventing scarring tiny scars block regenerating neurons renewing connections surviving nerve endings its become hot area look cells secrete factors may facilitate repair timothy j collier university rochester ny school medicine dentistry said everyones interested glial cells seem make damaged cells happier researchers begun genetically engineering glial cells attempts enhance therapeutic potential however freed said time become comfortable custommade cells fetal cells understand much better moreover scientists yet demonstrate engineered cells perform functions fetal counterparts i absolutely support engineered cellline research come improved transplant material said d eugene redmond director neurobehavior laboratory yale university but probability taking something like fibroblast engineering factors necessary neuronal function communication knows talk release transmitter this may involve thousand things added gage it certainly clear fetal neuronal transplants effective cell types present indeed fetal cells today seem awash scientific praise their ability survive multiply necessitates grafting small numbers cells adaptable host environment wrote university rochester neurobiologists john t hansen john r sladek review article journal science the benefits studying fetal cells many clinical potential use therapeutic tools realized in contrast redmond noted genealtered fibroblasts engineered cells going extremely suspect potential divide uncontrollably like cancerous tumors some alternatives going extreme liabilities at point gage said one really knows whether fetal cells live exalted promise ban ban thinks researchers need conduct fetal cell transplants animals procedure allowed moratorium embarking widespread human trials but fetal cell transplants humans proceed unimpeded value remain open question gage others say and decision whether go ahead trials based upon scientific rationale insist none reasons ban anything bad science good science whether reasonable pursue work scientific grounds gage said i cant believe patients degenerative diseases arms it doesnt seem real but im scientist
