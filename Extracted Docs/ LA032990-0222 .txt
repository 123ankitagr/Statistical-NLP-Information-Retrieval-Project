Donald Trump received approval today from state gaming regulators to open the palatial $ 1-billion Taj Mahal Casino Resort , the developer 's third casino in the famed resort city . The state Casino Control Commission voted unanimously to grant Trump a license . The New York developer also owns the Trump Plaza and the Trump Castle resorts . The property 's grand opening next week will feature fireworks and a laser show . Industry analysts have said that Trump will have to take in more than $ 1 million daily to make the 1,250-room Taj a success . Trump floated $ 675 million in junk bonds to build the extravagant Boardwalk casino and must obtain $ 94 million annually to service the debt . Marvin Roffman , a veteran securities analyst who tracks casino companies , was fired Friday from Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. of Philadelphia after refusing to retract his opinion that the Taj might have difficulty during the traditionally slow winter months . Trump had complained to the firm about the analyst 's views .
