going global how europe helps small firms to export by william nothdurft german marshall fund 11 dupont circle nw washington dc 20036 for modern trade alchemists the perfect export promotion policy may be the everelusive philosophers stone in his quest for this magical device that might turn base domestic manufacturers into goldwinning exporters william nothdurft calls on fellow us alchemists to look to europes practitioners of export promotion to discover the way the breathless voyage across europe that he charts in going global is fascinating of immense value to exporters export organisations and bureaucrats attempting to define their role in export promotion but as with the original alchemists he is probably searching in vain he is no doubt correct to berate successive us administrations for leaving export promotion in a muddle he is also probably right to suggest that european governments have messed with export promotion strategies more than the us but he is probably wrong to suggest that europes governments have in contrast got things notably right his pages detail how small and medium sized companies the principal targets of export promotion effort play as marginal a part in europes export effort as they do in the us suffering the same limitations and the same myopias as he tracks the immense diversity of programmes tried across europe and reveals how shortlived so many of them are he unwittingly shows a picture as riddled with contradictions as littered with wasted efforts and as limited in its success as he complains of in the us a british reader must suspect naivety when mr nothdurft opens his book with a eulogy about londons docklands where one of the worlds great trading centres is being reborn regular visitors to docklands will puzzle at when he stumbled across the din of an international airport from which a new generation of merchants commutes to the trading capitals of a soontobeintegrated european market mr nothdurft seems to discern order in europe where most others see a chaos not unlike that which he complains about in the us but this is not to rob the book of its value governments have shown a remarkable inability over the past decades to discover how best to help exporters and mr nothdurfts comparison of schemes from the length and breadth of europe provide valuable food for thought
