New experimental data supports the suspicion that getting enough potassium in the diet may play a key part in keeping blood pressure under control . The research suggests that when people do not get enough potassium in their diet , their bodies fail to get rid of enough salt , which makes their blood pressure go up . Epidemiological studies that look at large groups of people have found an association between low potassium intake and high blood pressure . But experts were uncertain whether the potassium or some other nutritional deficiency was responsible . In the latest study , doctors compared the blood pressures of 10 healthy people on very low-potassium diets and on diets with normal amounts of the nutrient . `` When these people ate diets low in potassium , their blood pressures went up . One of the main reasons seems to be related to sodium excretion . When not eating enough potassium , they could not get rid of enough sodium , '' said Dr. G. Gopal Krishna , who directed the study at Temple University in Philadelphia . The study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine .
