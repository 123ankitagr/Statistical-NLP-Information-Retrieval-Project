Sir , Samuel Brittan believes that neither academic macro-economists nor economic commentators have been at the forefront of the trade debate ( 'Trade and macroeconomics ' , July 12 ) . He need look no further than the FT 's own pages to see that Prof Jagdish Bhagwati has been the most lucid , jargon-free and easy to understand academic that one could possibly hope to read . Prof Bhagwati was even adviser to Arthur Dunkel , the recently-departed head of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Indeed , such is his patience and commitment over the years that the so-called free trade exceptions outlined by Prof Paul Krugman and others have been consistently shown to be a re-hash of the same old protectionist arguments . Prof Bhagwati deserves a Nobel prize for patience for being there when needed to knock fatuous protectionist arguments on their head . He also deserves the Nobel prize for economics for his many years of clear thinking . The free trade area is badly in need of this award , given the knife-edge which we are currently on in the Gatt neg-otiations . Onesimo Alvarez-Moro , Pontejos , 2 , 2 Puerta 6 , 28012 Madrid , Spain
