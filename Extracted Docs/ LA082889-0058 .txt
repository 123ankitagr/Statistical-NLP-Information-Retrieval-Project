Gunmen killed the former head of Italian railways in a Mafia-style ambush Sunday , police said . Police said Ludovico Ligato was hit by about 20 bullets when three men opened fire as he and his wife stood outside their villa after saying goodby to dinner guests . Ligato , who resigned last year along with the entire board of Italy 's railway system over a corruption scandal , tried to run back into the house . But the gunmen closed in and shot him at point-blank range .
