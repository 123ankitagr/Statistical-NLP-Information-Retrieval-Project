The risk of viral transmission , together with a shortage in blood supplies , has focused attention on the development of human blood substitutes . New Jersey-based biotechnology company Enzon has now been granted a patent for its red blood cell substitute which uses bovine ( cow ) haemoglobin . The haemoglobin is modified by attaching hair-like strands of the polymer polyethylene glycol ( PEG ) to the protein in order to reduce its recognition by the body 's immune system . This PEG-haemoglobin circulates longer in the body , producing fewer allergic reactions . PEG-haemoglobin also eliminates the need for blood typing and matching . Enzon : US , 908 980 4500 .
