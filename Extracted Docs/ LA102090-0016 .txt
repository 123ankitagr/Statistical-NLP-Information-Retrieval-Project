I read with interest Peter Steinhart 's column ( `` Giving Our Children a Break , '' Opinion , Oct. 14 ) advocating passage of Prop . 128 , Big Green . I was an early supporter and financial backer of Big Green . As I considered the proposal more thoroughly , I sadly concluded it is a typical `` deep thinkers '' response of correcting bad behavior with bad law . It wo n't solve our problems . Ultimately , it will exacerbate them by forcing exorbitant future costs on society and stymie targeted efforts to deal intelligently with specific problems . Policy often has undiscovered consequences . Big Green would be a Big Mistake . KIP DELLINGER , Los Angeles
