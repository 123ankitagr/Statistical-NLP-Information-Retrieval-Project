in response to assigned-risk rates to rise average of 85 sept 20 now that my auto insurance is being raised from 575 to 1,000 per year i have assigned-risk insurance because my car is old 1965 model i suppose i should jump for joy for getting a discount from the insurance companies when they get both feet in the door with good old no-fault no way i'm going to give myself a 100 discount no more insurance until the state gives me affordable insurance i would like to see the state add an insurance fee 200 to the license fee on every vehicle this probably will never happen because it would be asking our politicians to put their hands back in their own pockets jerome holbrook inglewood
