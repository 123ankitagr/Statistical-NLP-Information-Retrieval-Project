mitsubishi the most tightly interwoven of japans keiretsu corporate families is a classic example of how formerly cosy group ties are being subjected to market forces it is an empire of 216000 employees prominent in businesses ranging from banking to beer shipping and shipbuilding property oil aerospace and textiles on average the 29 companies at the heart of the group hold 38 per cent of each others shares above the average for keiretsu corporate families mitsubishi companies exchange more directors than do other keiretsu and have a long record of rallying member companies from different parts of the group to cooperate on projects one of the main competitive advantages of the keiretsu system tokyos business district marunouchi is dominated by the headquarters of 15 mitsubishi group companies known as mitsubishi village a visual symbol of their central role in japans industrial establishment intragroup cooperation can be taken less for granted since the onset of recession in 1991 prompted management across the group to place profitability rather than gaining market share as the prime objective says mr masayoshi hayashikawa general manager of planning at mitsubishi corporation the trading company near the heart of the group this new approach is best illustrated by the recent decision of nippon yusen a shipper in the group to buy south korean ships for the first time rather than from its usual supplier mitsubishi heavy industries the yens rise has made japanese shipbuilding costs 30 per cent higher than south koreas a mutually beneficial relationship in steel and ships that is a thing of the past says mr tsuda yoshida managing director of mitsubishi heavy industries similarly mhi recently decided to use nissho iwai a member of the sanwa keiretsu to sell its ownheavy machinery in indonesia mitsubishi group members also have no qualms about declining requests from mitsubishi estate to take space in one of the worlds most expensive buildings the underoccupied y270bn 80floor landmark tower in yokohama however family members still close ranks when business interests or opportunities are at stake landmark tower for example is a classic example of the kind of mistimed property development that has brought many developers to their knees the project was started by mitsubishi estate just before the spectacular collapse in inflated asset prices four years ago and completed in july last year in the depth of the recession an independent company might have been forced to dump the project yet mitsubishi estate was able to carry on confident that mitsubishi bank would continue funding the project through good times and bad landmark tower may be a white elephant today but even the most critical property analysts believe that any company that can afford to continue owning the tower will end up in a few years with one of the finest assets in the domestic property market but perhaps the most enduring quality of the keiretsu system says mr hayashikawa is its ability to pass information fast around the corporate family in mitsubishis case the vehicle for this is the socalled friday club at which the bosses of the top 29 member companies meet for a chat over lunch on the second friday of each month on the top floor of the mitsubishi building in marunouchi it is at this gathering that intelligence can be shared paving the way for group companies to work together an example of how this teamwork can still pay dividends is the cooperation between mitsubishis trading oil exploration and oil refining arms in making off the coast of vietnam last june the largest oil discovery by a japanese company for 35 years
