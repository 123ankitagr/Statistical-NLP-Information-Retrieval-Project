sir there are sound economic reasons why consumers need to be given consistent and accurate information if they are to make efficient choices about transport fading blueprint of a greener world january 26 unfortunately the chapter of professor pearces book measuring sustainable development which deals with transport makes two fundamental errors these invalidate his conclusions that road transport fails to pay for its full costs first government tax revenues from road transport were pounds 23bn last year not the pounds 147bn which he cites it is true that many motoring taxes are in forms which do not help motorists understanding of transport costs since they do not in many cases relate to usage a motoring tax system based on use rather than ownership and purchase of vehicles would improve economic and environmental efficiency the total taxtake is already sufficient to meet the full costs but a reform of the tax structure should relate tax more closely to usage second professor pearce includes congestion costs as an external cost of the road transport system this is not the case while it is true that congestion costs are highly wasteful and should be reduced they are inflicted by motorists on one another not on nonroad users congestion costs are therefore internal costs which have already been paid for by road users in lost time and extra fuel used to require motorists to pay these charges again would amount to massive double counting if these factors are taken into account then using professor pearces figures road taxes exceed road costs by pounds 6bn motoring costs are not twice the amount fetched by road taxes there is in fact no objective basis for any increase in the overall taxation level from road use though the structure of existing taxes and other motoring costs could be improved significantly it is also the case that fewer people are killed and injured on britains roads than previously though still not few enough air pollution from vehicles is declining rapidly as new cars are fitted with catalysts and vehicles are becoming quieter most of the social costs associated with road transport are in fact falling mike hollingsworth chief economist the society of motor manufacturers and traders forbes house halkin street london sw1x 7ds from mr paul everitt sir the assertion that road users do not pay enough for the use of britains road network is undermined by a number of significant omissions fading blueprint of a greener world not only does it underestimate the existing tax burden by some pounds 7bn but completely ignores the existence of significant benefits that accrue from road use surely we should look at the value of having more than 2m people employed in the road transport sector or the increased leisure and work opportunities that road use allows britains citizens how much value do we place on the availability of fresh produce and product choice in our shops at prices that can be afforded increasing the cost of road use will have a direct impact on the cost of living of individuals and the profitability of british industry road pricing will have much wider social and economic impacts than is recognised by professor pearce and a balance sheet that ignores them represents an incomplete analysis paul everitt assistant director british road federation pillar house 194202 old kent road london se1 5tg
