AMERICAN Airlines triggered another round of transatlantic price cuts yesterday by trimming another Pounds 10 from its economy fares between the UK and the US . Its London to New York fare is now Pounds 249 . It is also offering Pounds 30 return fares for onward flights to some other US cities , Daniel Green writes . The cuts follow reductions announced last week by all the main airlines linking the US and the UK . BA and Virgin Atlantic said they would not change their tariffs in response to the move . Virgin 's fare is already Pounds 249 , and BA said its Pounds 259 fare includes a Pounds 10 security charge that is extra on the other airlines . Virgin conceded that its customers pay Pounds 10 more than the published fare .
