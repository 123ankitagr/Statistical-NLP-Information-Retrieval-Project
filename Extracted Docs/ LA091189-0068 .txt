A new test appears effective at identifying early breast cancer patients at greatest risk for suffering a life-threatening recurrence of the disease , researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine said last week . In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , the researchers reported that breast cancer patients who test positively for a protein called Hpr have nearly four times the chances that their cancer will come back , indicating that they may be candidates for the strongest cancer-fighting drugs initially . The researchers tested cancer tissue samples from 70 women diagnosed with Stage 1 and Stage 2 breast cancer from 1977 through 1985 . Those who tested positively for Hpr had nearly four times the risk of suffering a recurrence compared to those who did not in the 11 years after diagnosis , the researchers found . Although they are not sure how Hpr , or haptoglobin-related protein , would influence the chances of having a recurrence , scientists suspect that the protein may play a role in the cancer 's ability to spread .
