Medals and memorabilia belonging to Olympic hero Harold Abrahams , whose story was told in the movie `` Chariots of Fire , '' fetched $ 39,720 at auction today . Egyptian-born entrepreneur Mohamed Fayed bought about 30 of Abrahams ' medals , stopwatches he used during training and his Commander of the British Empire award bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II in 1957 , Christie 's auctioneers said . The gold medal Abrahams won for the 100-meter race in the 1924 Paris Olympics was not among the items sold ; it was stolen from his home about 50 years after his victory . Abrahams ' struggles to win Olympic gold were portrayed by Ben Cross in the 1981 Oscar-winning movie . He was the first and only Englishman to win the Olympic 100 meters and gave up athletics after a fall in a long jump competition in 1925 . He died in 1978 . `` I was inspired by a man who put principle before winning , '' said Fayed , who with his two brothers owns Harrods department store . The medals will go on display at Harrods before Christmas . Abrahams ' adopted daughter , Susan Pottle , said she and her brother , Patrick , decided to sell the collection because it was languishing in a desk drawer . `` It seemed a pity to just leave them there , '' she said . `` We wanted it to go to someone who will treasure it or to a museum .
