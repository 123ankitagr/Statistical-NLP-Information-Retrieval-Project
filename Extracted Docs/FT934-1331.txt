The quoted retail groups are being even more secretive than usual about their Christmas performance according to Mr John Richards , stores analyst at NatWest Markets , as the slightest hint of weakness can have a dramatic effect on their share price , Neil Buckley writes . 'But there has been no evidence of any major retailer having any distress sales or special unplanned promotions , ' Mr Richards said - in sharp contrast to the situation two years ago . Signet , the jewellery group which changed its name from Ratners this year , has in the past made up to 90 per cent of its annual profits in the Christmas trading period . Woolworths makes virtually its entire annual profit between October and January . Boots makes about half its profits in the Christmas period and WH Smith about one-third . For most non-food retailers except the DIY chains a good Christmas is the key to a good year . John Lewis Partnership , virtually the only large retailer to publish sales comparisons , said that while sales in the first week of December topped its estimate , at 4.1 per cent higher than last year , 'the rate of advance was somewhat below that to which we have become accustomed ' .
