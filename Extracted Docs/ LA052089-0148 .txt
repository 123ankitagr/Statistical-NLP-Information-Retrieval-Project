The award categories did not include best actor or best actress but , then again , journalists were n't allowed to make the nominations . Nevertheless , there were some choice trophies handed out this week by the Public Relations Society of America -- Orange County chapter in Costa Mesa . Take , for instance , the category of best `` Feature Story for Consumer Magazine/Newspaper-Planted . '' The award goes to the PR rep who `` plants '' the best article in a magazine . And last year appears to have been a banner one for planted articles -- there were multiple winners in that category . Of the group 's 180 members , 31 received awards Thursday night at the 14th annual Protos Awards Banquet in categories such as best press kit , best news release/feature , best speech and the best `` PR for PR . '' The two top honorees were Laer Pearce of Laer Pearce & Associates , who received a distinguished service award for outstanding contributions to the PR field , and Nordstrom department stores , which received a distinguished service award for a corporation . Some of the winners lost no time in spreading the word about their victories . On Friday morning , fax machines and mailboxes were overflowing with press releases hyping the people who write press releases . `` Paine & Associates Sweeps Photos Awards -- Agency Dominates Two Categories , Wins Numerous Others , '' read the release from one Costa Mesa firm . Rolf Rudestam , the group 's president , seemed slightly embarrassed by his industry 's lack of humility . `` A lot of the agencies put out their own releases , '' he said . `` They tried to toot their own horns .
