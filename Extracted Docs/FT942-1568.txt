Two big stock market-listed Taiwanese companies are launching global roadshows this week for equity-linked bond issues worth Dollars 700m . The deals reflect the increasing appetite of local companies for overseas funds . President Enterprises , Taiwan 's biggest foods conglomerate , will kick off an international roadshow in Hong Kong today aimed at promoting the Dollars 100m issue of what will be Taiwan 's first exchangeable bond issue . The issue will be lead-managed by Bankers Trust , with Banque Paribas as co-lead , a senior finance manager at the group said . To avoid dilution of shares in the parent company , the bonds may be exchanged into shares in Tonyi Industrial Corp , a listed subsidiary and Taiwan 's biggest producer of tin plate . Formosa Chemical & Fibre and Nanya Plastics , part of the Formosa Plastics group , earlier this week began a joint tri-continental tour in Singapore to raise Dollars 300m each through a convertible bond issue . The coupon rate is expected to be between 1.75 and 2 per cent , and the conversion premium will be set at between 5 and 10 per cent , according to a manager in Formosa Plastics ' finance department . The funds will be used to finance a Dollars 7.8bn naphtha cracker complex . Formosa Plastics is Taiwan 's biggest private-sector conglomerate . Formosa Plastics itself plans to issue another Dollars 300m in convertible bonds later this year . Euroconvertible bonds have now been issued by 16 Taiwanese companies , and five have issued global depository receipts . Under existing Taiwan securities regulations , foreign holders of equity-linked bonds issued by Taiwanese companies are not permitted to convert them into listed shares . However , it widely understood the government is considering a change in the conversion laws , possibly within the next two years .
