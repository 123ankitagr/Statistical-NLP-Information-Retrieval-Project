MOSCOW has given state guarantees paving the way for Bonn to resume government export credits and revitalise trade between Germany and Russia , the economics ministry said yesterday , Reuter reports from Bonn . A Bonn official said Russia had provided the long-awaited documents to allow the German government to grant its Hermes export guarantees . Trade between Russia and Germany has virtually stalled since January when Bonn put a DM5bn ( Pounds 1.7bn ) ceiling on export guarantees for the former Soviet Union . Moscow had earlier failed to give its guarantee to either Germany 's State Reconstruction Bank or the German export credit organisation , saying this was against its constitution . Bonn 's first export guarantee of the year for the former Soviet Union went to Ukraine in April .
