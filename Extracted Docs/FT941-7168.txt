newmont gold the biggest us gold producer yesterday claimed that its patented process for recovering gold from very low grade refractory or difficult ore by using bacteria was commercially viable the company has been employing thiobacillus ferrooxidans naturallyoccuring bugs to do in months what would otherwise take millions of years gencor of south africa uses similar bacteria for its gold bioleaching process increasingly employed worldwide but newmonts is different in that ore is piled in a huge heap rather than treated by liquid in tanks newmont has already stockpiled at its mines on the carlin trend in nevada material that would be waste if bioleaching did not work mr peter philip president said that it was now likely newmont would be able to count the gold in the material towards its reserves by the end of the year 11m ounces of it costs would depend each specific project but mr philip said that they would be roughly dollars 350 a tonne treated his company was in talks with american barrick its neighbour on the carlin trend which has about 20m tonnes of low grade refractory material containing 1m ounces of gold if it proves commercially viable to use newmonts bioleaching process on the barrick material the partners would share the capital costs and the profits mr philip said newmont had identified other mines around the world where bioleaching might be able to turn waste into ore and was looking for more joint ventures similar to the one contemplated with barrick he said treatment of the barrick material could begin on a commercial basis as early as next year newmont would not need to treat its own material until 1996 mr philip hoped that before then newmonts new process would have been superseded by a second process that could release gold from lowgrade refractory ore that also contains carbon a material to which gold naturally sticks so no matter how well the bacteria do their job the precious metal is still not released newmonts land in nevada has great deal of this type of material containing an estimated 29m ounces of gold
