newmont gold the biggest us gold producer yesterday claimed that its patented process for recovering gold from very low grade refractory or difficult ore by using bacteria was commercially viable the company has been employing thiobacillus ferro-oxidans naturally-occuring bugs to do in months what would otherwise take millions of years gencor of south africa uses similar bacteria for its gold bio-leaching process increasingly employed world-wide but newmont's is different in that ore is piled in a huge heap rather than treated by liquid in tanks newmont has already stockpiled at its mines on the carlin trend in nevada material that would be waste if bio-leaching did not work mr peter philip president said that it was now likely newmont would be able to count the gold in the material towards its reserves by the end of the year 1.1 m ounces of it costs would depend each specific project but mr philip said that they would be roughly dollars 3.50 a tonne treated his company was in talks with american barrick its neighbour on the carlin trend which has about 20 m tonnes of low grade refractory material containing 1 m ounces of gold if it proves commercially viable to use newmont's bio-leaching process on the barrick material the partners would share the capital costs and the profits mr philip said newmont had identified other mines around the world where bio-leaching might be able to turn waste into ore and was looking for more joint ventures similar to the one contemplated with barrick he said treatment of the barrick material could begin on a commercial basis as early as next year newmont would not need to treat its own material until 1996 mr philip hoped that before then newmont's new process would have been superseded by a second process that could release gold from low-grade refractory ore that also contains carbon a material to which gold naturally sticks so no matter how well the bacteria do their job the precious metal is still not released newmont's land in nevada has great deal of this type of material containing an estimated 2.9 m ounces of gold
