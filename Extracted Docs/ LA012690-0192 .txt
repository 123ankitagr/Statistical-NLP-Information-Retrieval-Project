Former Phoenix Cardinals quarterback Neil Lomax will have a hip transplant in the next four to six weeks , the NFL team 's orthopedic physician said today . Dr. Russell Chick said the transplant will be done in Los Angeles by himself and Dr. Larry Dorr , a hip replacement specialist from California . Lomax , a Pro Bowl selection in 1984 and 1987 , retired last week after nine seasons with the Cardinals because of degenerative arthritis in his left hip .
