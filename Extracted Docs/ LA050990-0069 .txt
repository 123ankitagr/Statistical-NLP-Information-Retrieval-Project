The Big Ten or the Big Twelve ? West Virginia has talked with conference officials about joining the Big Ten , should it decide to expand its membership , according to Mountaineer Athletic Director Ed Pastilong . The Big Ten presidents have already invited Penn State to join , although that situation reportedly has grown shaky because of opposition from some members . Still , there has been speculation that if Penn State gets in , the conference will add a 12th member . West Virginia is independent in football and an Atlantic 10 Conference member in basketball and several other sports .
