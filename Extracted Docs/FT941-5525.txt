i have a protected tenancy of a property which is my main residence the landlord is offering me a substantial sum of money to surrender the tenancy would i be liable to income or capital gains tax the answer probably is no but you have not given us much to go on if you are employing a solicitor in the negotiations for the surrender of your tenancy then he is best placed to advise you on the tax aspects no legal responsibility can be accepted by the financial times for the answers given in these columns all enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible
