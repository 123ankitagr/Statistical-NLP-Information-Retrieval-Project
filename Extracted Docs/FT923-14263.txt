THE US Food and Drug Administration yesterday asked Marion Merrell Dow , the American pharmaceuticals group , to warn doctors that Seldane , its anti-histamine , is potentially dangerous to certain patients . The drug had worldwide sales of Dollars 768m last year , of which Dollars 534m were in the US . In the UK , the company claims Seldane is the best-selling over-the-counter remedy . The FDA said the drug was potentially dangerous when used by patients with damaged liver or those taking two other drugs , Ketoconazole , an anti-fungal treatment , and Erythromycin , an antibiotic . Although one patient has died , the FDA stressed reactions were rare . Marion Merrell Dow said it was changing the labels , warning of such problems and the need to restrict dosing to less than 120mg a day .
