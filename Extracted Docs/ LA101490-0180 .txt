at a posh burbank restaurant gary lieberthal chairman of columbia pictures television was lunching with jerry katzman head of the tv division at the william morris agency and ricky schroeders agent the squeakyclean adolescent star from silver spoons just as the waiter served the appetizers lieberthal reached into his breast pocket and pulled out a milliondollar check made out to schroeder here lieberthal announced as he presented the check to katzman in a tone that suggested a rich uncle giving a quarter to his favorite nephew for a lollipop is a little something for your client to enjoy himself with lieberthal was not being gratuitously generous silver spoons ran for four years on nbc and raked in $ 139 million in rerun sales for columbia the tv executive was simply advancing schroeder a piece of his net proceeds in the show ahead of schedule a tactic to ensure that the star would remain at the studio and help develop another hit on the order of silver spoons schroeder stayed at columbia that scene has been played out countless times during the past 18 months in lawyers and agents offices around hollywood as lieberthal has led the stampede in bidding up the fees paid to writers and producers of television programs hollywood in the 1990s resembles wall street in the 1980s and for many columbia is behaving like any number of the big investment banks of that period that went on hiring binges lavished huge salaries on executives and spent millions simply to renovate offices for their star recruits columbia pictures in recent years has consistently ranked at the bottom among the major hollywood studios in boxoffice success but the highly publicized difficulties with its two motion picture divisions have tended to overshadow columbia pictures television an extremely profitable operation that is attempting to break out of its conservative mold lieberthal with the apparent blessing of columbia cochairmen peter guber and jon peters has embarked upon the biggest spending spree in the history of the television business dispensing buckets of money on hot writers and producers who are perceived to have the magical touch or the clout to develop hit network shows columbias producers and writers in tv the jobs are basically the same include many of the biggest names in the tv comedy business norman lear all in the family ed weinberger the cosby show hugh wilson wkrp in cincinnati james l brooks mary tyler more show norman steinberg doctor doctor and the teams of ron leavitt and michael moye married with children and blake hunter and marty cohan whos the boss more recently columbia has begun to recruit producers who specialize in less lucrative onehour dramas as well such as bruce paltrow john tinker and tom fontanta st elsewhere david milch hill street blues frank lupo ateam hunter and michael landon highway to heaven columbia will not reveal how much its spending on socalled creative talent but an executive at a rival studio who has bid on many of the same deals pitched by agents estimates that writers and producers are costing the studio $ 30 million to $ 35 million annually in overhead since most of the deals are for a minimum of three years columbia is committed to spend about $ 100 million simply on writers and producers theyve put a lot of money to work observes gary cosay a partner in leading artists agency who negotiated a $ 33million renewal deal at columbia on behalf of the comedy writers leavitt and moye columbia has got more name people than any other studio at this time yet some a list producers recruited by lieberthal to columbia admit that the studio may be doing little more than what any large corporation with deep pockets would do when it wants to expand aggressively buy up market share its a very conservative approach and also one of a wellfunded company acknowledges drama producer david milch who nonetheless doesnt see talented but unknown tv writers getting crowded out among all the heavyweights guys like jim brooks always have half an eye peeled for newcomers for many however columbia is exhibit a in explaining why hollywoods costs are spiraling out of control although rival walt disney co has also pushed up the fees paid to tv producers columbias deals have come to represent the highstakes poker game at its most aggressive scott siegler president of columbia pictures tv defends the strategy like it or not the marketplace determines the value of these people you can either be on the sidelines and watch or go to the forefront and say if thats the game i intend to win so far columbia has failed to score it ranks last among the six major studios in shows sold to the networks baby talk originally slated on abc this fall has been embroiled in lawsuits and pushed back until next year and plans for a cbs series from norman lear jody gordon and the news were abandoned after lear decided he wanted to devote his time to a pet project sunday dinner we didnt have the best year admits siegler who expresses unswerving faith in columbias strategy if you have good people and are doing good work eventually the marketplace will reward you financing for columbias nasascale program to develop tv shows comes from the syndication revenues provided by columbias program library perhaps the most valuable catalogue of its kind in hollywood the cash cow at columbia right now is whos the boss originally produced by embassy which has run on abc for seven years and generated $ 417 million so far in syndication revenue the secondhighest grossing show in history behind the cosby show because of contracts that commit local tv stations to buy additional episodes at 10 higher fees columbia reaps $ 62 million for every year after the fifth season that whos the boss stays on abc columbia has another syndication gusher on its hands in the raunchy fox comedy married with children despite the criticism leveled at married with children by sponsors and educators it is likely to become the thirdhighest grossing tv show in history earning columbia more than $ 200 million again for each additional year after the fifth season columbia will earn another $ 40 million in license fees alone if you took away those two shows we would be making a hell of a lot less money and we couldnt operate on the basis that weve been operating lieberthal admits the syndication business however is volatile and past successes are no guarantee for the future how much local tv stations can pay for the reruns of old shows depends on unpredictable factors such as the advertising climate and supply and demand of syndicated product stations are finding they need fewer sitcoms warns matt shapiro a vice president at mmt sales in new york which advises local tv stations on which shows to buy thats because the older ones like night court and cheers have lasted longer than expected and stations cant absorb all the newer ones so far a recent downturn in the syndication market has not seemed to hurt columbia or its ability to achieve record prices for shows despite new markets for reruns cable foreign broadcasters and others columbia still earns more than 80 of its syndication revenue from local tv stations in the past we looked to a handful of customers for a majority of our dollars explains barry thurston the pixieish president of the studios syndication division now we are spreading our customer base cable is picking up the slack where syndication used to be strong because of the money flowing from its library of network halfhour comedies most of which was acquired in columbias 1985 purchase of norman lears embassy communications there has been little incentive to expand beyond the studios core business of producing primetime network tv shows embassydeveloped series have earned $ 500 million in syndication during the past five years although studios such as paramount universal and warner bros moved successfully and aggressively into producing tv shows for syndication and cable columbia stubbornly clung to turning out formula shows mostly halfhour comedies a practice that earned it the derisive nickname among some producers as clonenumbia but alan levine the guarded entertainment lawyer brought in last year as chief operating officer for the studio says current management will push columbia into new markets such as firstrun syndication madefortv movies miniseries basic and pay cable and international coventures the philosophy of the company has changed he states all genres of programs that make sense will be developed and produced one new idea an hourlong drama series developed by milch and internationally cofinanced and produced with general motors as a major backer another is a latenight soap opera possibly for syndication columbia since it is owned by a foreign company is prohibited from buying more than a 20 stake in tv stations although theoretically it could still own a broadcast network that leaves the studio to concentrate on making shows when i got into this business there were five channels to watch now there are 90 its going to be software lieberthal proclaims columbia believes its strategy of recruiting brandname talent will pay off because there is a good chance that at least one of the writerproducers will create another hit on the order of whos the boss but lieberthal says it will take three years to tell and if there are no hits lieberthal mulls that question for a moment then nodding his head toward the window he laughs there will be a lot of expensive parking spaces down there
