dear miss manners a young lady who works with me said she had met a wonderful middle-aged man who so excited her that they became intimately involved on the first date but only after he had shown her the town including dinner and dancing at a very expensive establishment however he had to leave her apartment earlier the next morning than she did and after he had departed she returned to her bedroom to find 50 in her dresser her evening of joy was suddenly transformed into feelings that bordered on outright hatred how could he do something like this to me what kind of lady did he take me for anyway the next time he called one day later she bawled him out and refused to see him again another lady at work said she would have seen him again so she could punch him in the face a third lady the ex-spouse of a multimillionaire responded to the two younger ladies i'm old enough to be your mother so i'm going to give you some advice a lady never asks for money after such a romantic evening however should a gentleman offer money she never refuses is the third lady correct gentle reader third lady miss manners doesn't count any ladies in this anecdote neither apparently did the gentleman you at least made a halfhearted attempt to convince miss manners that the person in question was so felled by overwhelming passion as to overcome the circumspect practices of an otherwise respectable life miss manners is not saying that you were successful the mention of the expensive evening suggests that barter was indeed in her mind but there seems to have been no such effort at persuading the gentleman who therefore drew his own conclusions perhaps your young colleague believes that spending the night with a near-stranger is merely a conventional way of getting to know someone better in that case this experience should teach her that the belief is far from universal
