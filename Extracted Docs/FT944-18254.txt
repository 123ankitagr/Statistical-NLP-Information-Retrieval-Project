the internet a global network of computer networks linking an estimated 30 m computer users and the forerunner to the much ballyhooed information highway is creating both opportunities and challenges for traditional publishers unlike commercial on line information services such as compuserve prodigy and america on line that charge users either according to the amount of time spent accessing the service or the number of documents read the internet is largely unmonitored any information be it the text of a novel the price of stocks or articles from a newspaper or magazine that is accessible via the internet is essentially in the public domain free to anyone who can figure out how to find it in the vast unmapped labyrinth of cyberspace despite the lack of copyright enforcement on the internet which potentially could undermine the value of their traditional paper-based products leading publishing houses are showing increasing interest in the internet as a new publishing medium the potential of this huge new market one new internet user is said to be logging on every two minutes is too much to ignore despite the drawbacks the new wave of internet users is dominated by corporate users and by well-heeled consumers making them a particularly attractive target for many publishers several business models have emerged as publishers attempt to tap into this potentially important new market these range from offering teasers to on-line readers in the hopes of persuading them to subscribe to magazines and newsletters to experiments with electronic distribution of book manuscripts one of the biggest attractions of the internet is that it is a very low cost publishing channel anybody with a personal computer a modem and an account with one of the hundreds of services that offer internet access can in theory publish whatever they wish for the cost of a telephone call beyond lowering the cost of vanity publishing however the internet represents an opportunity to add value to the purchase of reference works and textbooks addison-wesley for example is making one of its textbooks parallel programming for scientists and engineers available on the internet the publisher assumes that students will still want to buy bound copies of the book but will appreciate the opportunity to search the text on-line in another internet publishing experiment encyclopedia britannica is going on-line to offer electronic distribution of its materials to universities and some public libraries using software that limits access the publisher plans to charge libraries according to a formula reflecting the size of their subscriber base the electronic version of the encyclopedia called britannica online is being tested at the university of california at san diego the on-line version includes hypertext links that guide users to related topics as they search through the text a feature that cannot be matched by the traditional book version for magazines and newsletters aimed at computer buffs the internet can be a valuable distribution channel the magazine wired which has built a reputation for publishing articles about the internet provides internet users with copies of back issues and the opportunity to subscribe on-line via commercial information services such as america on line the electronic newsstand a washington dc-based company founded last year offers publishers an opportunity to market magazines books newsletters and business information via the internet for a dollars 1000 set-up fee and a share of subscription payments most of the publishers that use this service provide a few articles from each issue to lure subscribers in its first 10 months on the internet the electronic newsstand attracted over 3 m accesses from over 75,000 different sites the company says the electronic newsstand is in the forefront of a growing trend to create billboards on the information highway electronic spaces on the internet in which companies can display their wares another example of this trend is mecklerweb a new venture of meckler media the us publishing group launched earlier this year mecklerweb aims to provide companies with an inexpensive and rapid means of establishing an internet presence the company says one of the most successful commercial internet publishing projects is the global network navigator an internet magazine founded last october by o'reilly associates a us book publisher that specialises in computer topics by last month gnn had attracted over 40,000 registered users and twice as many unregistered visitors by offering articles about where to find information resources on the internet gnn is garnering attention from other businesses by establishing meta-centres' including a travel centre and a personal finance information centre that feature a mix of editorial and promotional material yet publishers must tread carefully as they move to exploit the potential of this self-regulated global village founded in the late 1960 s as a government-funded programme to link researchers at us universities and government laboratories electronically the internet was closed to all business activity until about two years ago and many internet users remain resistant to the intrusions of commercial enterprise other drawbacks include persistent security problems as internet crackers break through the barriers that companies attempt to build to limit access to commercially valuable information and the sometimes unreliable performance of the internet for now the internet is being used most effectively to publish information about products and services that can be delivered through traditional channels as metering and billing technologies evolve it could however become a significant medium for publishing and selling all kinds of information in the meantime the internet can provide companies with a low cost opportunity to reach markets that are beyond their geographic reach as well as valuable experience in the emerging market for electronic publishing
