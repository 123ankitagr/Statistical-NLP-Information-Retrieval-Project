it wasnt so much the man but his calling card reading athletic director stanford university that impressed the university of maryland the 14member search committee isnt saying how much research it conducted but when andy geiger expressed an interest it was struck with almost childish glee awe too all because he came from stanford so it was geiger who won the golden opportunity to succeed lew perkins who came to maryland after serving at wichita state the automatic question is why would anyone want to leave stanford richly endowed and with enormous prestige for the discontent and ongoing problems at maryland in conversations with an assistant who once worked for geiger and a stanford alumnus who knew him from almost the day he arrived the picture they paint is of an individual who knows how to project has outstanding intellect can sell an idea also himself has a good sense of humor is the ultimate politician enthusiastic can get things accomplished is creative and perceptive except in handling people one negative aspect to his 10year performance is that at stanford and previously at brown university and the university of pennsylvania he had difficulty keeping a staff either the people left or were fired also he has difficulty understanding how a football program should be conducted he has a tendency to avoid problems is not a good businessman has difficulty saying no can be overbearing likes to secondguess depleted the fiscal reserves at stanford and seemed more interested in getting a booster to make a donation rather than soliciting the help he or she might otherwise be able to offer his mental capacities are enormous and cant be underrated even though a bachelors degree from syracuse is the extent of his formal education he is receptive to appointing minorities to positions of authority has an ivy league aura usually says all the right things exudes some of the same characteristics found in network television executives and is a doer the addition of geiger could possibly bring an end to the maryland slump but maybe not some of the same maryland administrators including president william kirwan were in accord with the former chancellor john slaughter when he demonstrated how little he knew about sports slaughter after the damage was done took a hike going off to be president of occidental college marylands search committee making a recommendation to kirwan was no doubt overwhelmed by the mere anticipation it could attract an athletic director from stanford maybe there was a more gifted man or woman at long beach state kentucky alcorn state or aldersonbroaddus but being able to draw from stanford is what maryland wanted in playing its own game of climbing the academicathleticsocial ladder the only thing better would have been harvard or yale geiger doesnt have much to beat since hes following perkins who never clicked with the populace even though he had some important maryland graduates endeavoring to help him there are enormous problems at maryland coaches and assistant administrators trying to cover their own territories in a fight for survival plus recruiting difficulties so geiger is in an enviable position anything he does major or minor will be applauded and in time the conditions can only be improved because they have to get better even by osmosis take a bow andy its an almost cantmiss opportunity plus a salary in excess of $ 120000 and other benefits geiger no doubt had a longer relationship at stanford than early reaction to his administration would have suggested a 1983 column by glenn dickey in the san francisco chronicle offered this conclusion there is no question geiger has an outstanding mind those who have worked with him on innovative ideas in cabletv programming for instance praise his creativity and say he grasps ideas quickly in my own dealings with geiger i found he has a way of cutting through to the essentials of complicated deals some day perhaps soon those qualities will get him a job for which he is bettersuited a job in which he works primarily with ideas not people and when he leaves the sigh of relief within the stanford athletic department will be heard in downtown san francisco now the reign of geiger is about to begin not wanting to demean him but having the link to stanford was his most important professional credential it got him the job
