Pleased that voters have approved building a new , domed stadium , Mayor Henry G. Cisneros said he may run for re-election , although he earlier said he would leave politics because of personal problems . Cisneros said Sunday he would decide whether to enter the May 2 election contest after he talks with former Mayor Lila Cockrell , who already has announced her candidacy . Cockrell is considered the front-runner and has only one announced opponent , insurance businessman Carl Mauthe . Cisneros , a prominent Latino twice considered for the Democratic Party 's vice presidential nomination , said he will review his options during a trip to Massachusetts this week . Last October , Cisneros , who is married , acknowledged having a close personal relationship with political fund-raiser Linda Medlar , who also is married . The previous month , he said he would abandon politics in order to spend more time with his young son , John Paul , who is in poor health . Cisneros answered questions about his political plans as he met with reporters after a sales tax referendum to build the $ 174-million Alamodome stadium was passed Saturday .
