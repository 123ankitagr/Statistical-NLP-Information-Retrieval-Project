there potent symbols advanced technology 1990s high speed train the fast rail networks developed throughout europe promise remarkable reversal steady decline train travel way since end second world war high speed rail services origins japanese bullet train shinkansen first went service tokyo osaka 1964 but europe scattered centres population crowded transport routes idea taken a growing awareness potential rail travel prompted european commission 1990 launch programme bring together national initiatives detailed studies carried high speed task force scope programme recently extended include countries eastern europe the programme envisages creation european network high speed lines 2010 involves construction 5600 miles new track upgrading 9400 miles track creation 750 miles linking tracks the new lines take trains running 160 miles per hour upgraded lines handle speeds 125 mph the aim make rail attractive option business leisure travel journeys 125 miles 625 miles even longer journeys would realistic overnight journey times across europe would roughly halved brussels madrid falling eight hours nearly 16 12 hours brussels milan five hours 15 minutes 10 hours 20 minutes brussels berlin six hours 15 minutes nine hours the benefits high speed train travel airplanes cars delivers passengers city centres handle large volumes traffic less polluting means transport makes efficient use energy in addition high speed trains boost passenger numbers connecting slower intercity suburban lines increasing financial return entire network they also make important contribution regional economic policies improving links peripheral regions choked european airports crowded skies congested motorways combined make fast rail travel viable alternative many travellers the costs creating paneuropean high speed rail network estimated pounds 60bn though thought could lead quadrupling passenger mileage travelled passenger growth coupled improved productivity could lead rail companies achieving 10 per cent rate return project calculated it france high speed trains made biggest impact comprehensive network established although germany creating ambitious network high speed services the french railways began operating first highspeed trains trains grande vitesse tgv 170 mph paris lyon september 1981 halving journey time two hours doubling volume passengers using route the tgv atlantique followed 1989 linking paris bordeaux biarritz toulouse brittany speeds 185 mph the imminent opening channel tunnel led construction high speed lines north paris lille calais

network stalled several years however consortium international banks italian railways putting together proposals vastly expanded network linking turin venice milan naples at present high speed service crosses national border though change eurostar trains modified form tgv start running london paris brussels but 2002 highspeed services available british side tunnel delays beginning work highspeed line kent london the main barrier crossborder links varying technologies used different national railways the eurostar trains designed take account three different electricity networks four signalling systems including one channel tunnel track gauges distance rails problem europe though spain portugal ireland russia differ standard gauge a problem britain smaller loading gauge means continental european locomotives rolling stock broad high fit british station platforms many bridges technical harmonisation one biggest tasks task force working high speed paneuropean network a priority create
