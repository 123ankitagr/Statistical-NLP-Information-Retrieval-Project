how come john major didnt include a doctor in his team for moscow given that there has been so much speculation about the health of russias president yeltsin it might have been helpful if the pms quack was on hand especially since yeltsin is not going to have any more foreign visitors for several months to come in the good old communist days foreign governments often seemed more interested in how long russias leaders would last physically rather than politically when harold wilson visited the kremlin in the 1960s he took along his personal physician with the sole aim of getting an armslength diagnosis of whether andre gromyko russias foreign minister was nearing the end of his innings sadly the only thing that wilsons doctor could conclude was that there was something wrong with gromykos jaw
