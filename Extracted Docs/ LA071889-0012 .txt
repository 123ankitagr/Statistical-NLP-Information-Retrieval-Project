Alaska concluded that poor management by Exxon Shipping Co. is to blame for the nation 's worst oil spill . `` Exxon Shipping 's failures and lapses in management were so numerous and pervasive that it is a wonder the Exxon Valdez was the first tanker grounded , '' said Robert LeResche , head of the state inquiry into the spill . LeResche said in a 110-page report to the National Transportation Safety Board that the response to the spill by the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co. was a failure . The report follows NTSB hearings in Anchorage in May into the March 24 spill . The ship spewed 11 million gallons of oil when it hit a reef in Prince William Sound .
