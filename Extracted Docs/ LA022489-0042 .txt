when i was 8 years old my parents took me to cuba this is what i remember the people seemed very poor but life for us was very luxurious when i ordered ice cream out at the swimming pool a waiter in a tight uniform with very silly sleeves brought it out in an enormous coconut shell we visited a lot of rum factories and on our last day in the hotel a bomb went off in the lobby but at the new el mocambo 8338 w 3 rd st los angeles 213 651-2113 the revolution never happened the waiters waltz around in tight uniforms and almost half the menu consists of designer drinks made of rum and other intoxicants that have names like bay of pigs and babaloo-loo loo the menu is made up of dishes that will be familiar if you know the menu at cha cha cha chef toribio prado is consulting chef here or at cuban restaurants like versailles of the dishes we tried the corn chowder 5 and tostones 4.50 were very good as was the grilled chicken marinated in garlic lime and rum 10.50 the americano loco steak 18 was pretty respectable too paella on the other hand was a disappointment especially at 25 don't skip dessert if you order the coconut sorbet a waiter with silly sleeves will bring it out in a coconut shell ruth reichl
