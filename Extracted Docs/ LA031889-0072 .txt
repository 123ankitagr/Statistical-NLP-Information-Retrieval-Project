Roger Kahn ought to go after the guy who wrote the Al Campanis column under his name in the March 14 paper . The writer is obviously an imposter , because the real Roger Kahn , the one who wrote `` The Boys of Summer , '' the one with wit and whimsy , would never write such self-serving nonsense . If Kahn were really as defensive as this guy sounds , nobody would blame Tom Lasorda for giving him the cold shoulder . Why would a person seek to justify himself two years later ? Was that his last great claim to fame ? ROBERT GOYETTE Rolling Hills
