the last five years has been an era of massive consolidation within europe's railway manufacturing industry large businesses have been swallowing up their smaller rivals with the electrical engineering companies whose products make up the high value components of trains and trams driving the deals to date most railway procurement in europe has been nationalistically driven but the advent of the single european market increases the scope for cross-border deals most of the large companies now think in european or indeed global terms overshadowing the market now are two huge multinational groups swedish-swiss asea brown boveri and anglo-french gec-alsthom these two have built up extensive railway manufacturing portfolios including signalling as well as traction both have annual turnover of the order of pounds 1 bn abb's zurich plant is a significant producer of electrical equipment for light rail vehicles and the company has important manufacturing capacity in germany and sweden plus a stake in brel the former state-owned railway workshops in britain gec-alsthom is famed as builder of france's high-speed tgv but it also made the vehicles for the showpiece grenoble tramway and there are more such cars under construction for a new light rail route in northern paris meanwhile the british side of the consortium has been a driving force behind the manchester metrolink project the group owns factories in spain and belgium and has a collaboration agreement with the railway arm of fiat in italy competing with these two multinationals are some large german companies siemens a long-standing supplier of electrical equipment has been expanding into mechanical engineering three years ago it bought a majority holding in dusseldorf-based duewag one of the largest light rail vehicle builders in the world and a major beneficiary of the light rail renaissance in north america siemens has a foothold in the growing british market with a deal to build the vehicles for the sheffield supertram project it could also acquire electrical equipment manufacturing capacity in this country it has already expressed an interest in the rail side of hawker siddeley should btr decide to divest itself of this part of its recent purchase at some point in the future acquisitions recent acquisitions by siemens include a 51 per cent stake in skoda of czechoslovakia a builder of electric locomotives which siemens intends to expand to build suburban and metro trains as well and a minority holding in sgp one of the principal railway vehicle builders in austria the railway activities of the daimler-benz empire have been consolidated under the aeg-westinghouse umbrella a collaborative venture in which westinghouse of the us owns 19 per cent this group makes airport people-movers and also owns man-ghh of nuremberg which manufactures for the light rail sector the third force in the german light rail market is salzgitter-based linke hofmann busch which made the original cars for the docklands light railway in london while the americans virtually vacated the passenger railway manufacturing field in their flight to the car in the 1960 s and 1970 s and now largely have to rely on european and japanese technology the canadians retain a stake in the shape of bombardier of montreal this aerospace and railway conglomerate has been buying up european manufacturing capacity and owns bn of bruges belgium an important supplier in the light rail field the company is building 70 new vehicles to the docklands light railway the swiss with their well-respected tramway operations have niche suppliers of vehicles although high labour costs limit the opportunity for exports vehicle-builder vevey has recently signed a collaborative agreement with french electronics firm matra whose automatic mini-metro systems have won acceptance in town centres such as lille and in airport operations the italians have gained a name for low-cost vehicle building breda has built for a number of us cities and firema was sub-contracted by gec-alsthom to build the vehicles for the manchester metrolink subsidies from the italian government lower export prices but efforts to spread the political dividend can raise costs for instance the manchester order amounting to just 26 vehicles was spread over three factories an important contender in the low-cost field is ckd tatra of prague which it is reckoned has built one out of every three tramcars in the world thanks to the dominance of tramways in the former east bloc the introduction of dollar trading there has shattered that market and tatra is now seeking to penetrate western europe it already has a car undergoing trials on the oslo tram system tatra has a new design of car due to make its debut in prague this spring this will interest many cities as much of its floor is at a low level to help boarding by elderly and disabled people and the new vehicle thus competes directly with low-floor designs produced by western european builders thanks to a huge new factory built in the last years of communist rule and low labour costs the czech company is able to offer attractive prices it is now seeking a joint venture with one of the western european majors to gain access to new technology conspicuous mainly by their absence are the japanese their penetration of the railway market has not been anything as pervasive as it has been in the automotive field in the main european countries they have found it difficult to obtain a foothold although one recent success has been kawasaki's contract to supply bogies for the new trains for london's central line japanese companies have had a greater presence in the us market but this is now threatened by a wave of protectionist sentiment in january a contract with sumitomo to construct cars for los angeles new green line was cancelled and local politicians are now seeking to build their own factory in los angeles to make the vehicles the author is editor of urban transport international
