Ireland has suffered a mysterious invasion from the other end of the Earth that threatens to do serious long-term damage . The invader , which has spread out across Northern Ireland and is now entering the Republic of Ireland , is a lowly New Zealand worm called Artiopositalthia triangulata , which is slowly wiping out the native population of Irish worms . How the 6-inch-long New Zealand worm got to Ireland nobody knows . But it is thought that it probably arrived in Northern Ireland as egg capsules on the roots of a shrub more than 20 years ago . Since then it has proliferated in Northern Ireland and has recently been found on the southern side of the border . The respected British journal The New Scientist reported recently , `` Agricultural productivity in Northern Ireland could dip by at least one-third because a plague of flatworms has depleted the province 's population of native earthworms by 90 % .
