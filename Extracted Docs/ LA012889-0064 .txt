will rogers was america's most complete human document he reflected in many ways the heartbeat of america in thought and manner of appearance and in his daily life he was probably our most typical native born the closest living approach to what we like to call the true american damon runyon will rogers captured america's heart and tickled its funny bone as a ziegfeld follies star radio commentator movie actor and the author of more than 2 million words of wry commentary on life and politics many of them in a daily column that appeared in more than 500 newspapers but rogers knew better than to take his fame too seriously he didn't expect it to last forever he once said there are no indispensable men and there is always someone to take our place before our folks get home from the funeral so perhaps he would be pleasantly surprised by the success of the park that bears his name it's been more than 50 years since the cowboy philosopher died in a plane crash with aviator wiley post near barrow alaska yet each month more than 20,000 people turn off sunset boulevard in the hills of pacific palisades to enjoy will rogers state historic park the 186-acre park is a step back to the past because the grounds and buildings have been preserved much as they were on aug 15, 1935, when rogers died a portion of the more than 300-acre ranch about 100 acres was donated to the state of california in 1944, after the death of his widow betty the state gradually acquired an additional 86 acres family wanted to donate ranch mother always wanted it to be a memorial oldest son bill rogers said from his ranch in tubac ariz and it was quite expensive just too much for a private person to keep up and then we were splitting off you see when i graduated from college i got married and my brother james had his ranch out near bakersfield and my sister mary was gone to live in greece today this memorial to rogers offers a variety of relaxing attractions visitors can enjoy participating in or watching polo or soccer on the grass polo field hold a family picnic or relax on the spacious lawn which once was a miniature golf course they can explore the stables or hike into the hills all the way to adjoining 7,000 acre topanga state park and they can learn about will rogers a small theater shows a 12-minute film on rogers life and audio-wands provide a narrated tour of the park sprinkled with comments from family and friends of rogers docents give tours through the family home and a shop offers a number of hard-to-find books by and about rogers other items include a lariat with instructions on rope tricks and audio tapes of rogers radio broadcasts and the one-man show in which james whitmore portrayed rogers the centerpiece of the park is the ranch house which started out as a small weekend cabin in 1924 after rogers decided to move from his beverly hills home which he called the house that jokes built the ranch house underwent a series of additions and alterations until it grew to 31 rooms to accommodate his family and a platoon of friends and visitors the living room an impressive tribute to the old west occupies almost all of the first floor of one wing a bronze on the mantel of the massive fireplace is the work of western artist charles russell rogers close friend and the andirons in the shapes of cowboys were created by artist edward borein four russell watercolors are in the living room amid horse tack bolos from argentina navajo baskets and blankets and family photos a rustic chandelier made from a pioneer-era neck yoke is above a heavy spanish-style dining table and recently restored navajo blankets cover the hardwood floor beneath a victorian red-wicker swing that hangs from the ceiling an old cigar-store indian sits in a corner silently observing it all ziegfeld's present the opposite end of the room has two major focal points a floor-to-ceiling picture window and a staircase the window was a present from florenz ziegfeld a frequent visitor to the ranch according to rogers ziegfeld liked the view but he had to go out on the porch ziegfeld had the window installed as a surprise for his follies star there's even a stuffed calf used for roping practice the calf was a gift from artist borein and the goal was to spare rogers friends who were tired of him roping them and this is just a sampling of the items in the room which seems chock-full of artifacts but rogers younger son jim says the decor is really quite sparse compared to what it was at one time many items were moved to the will rogers memorial in claremore okla where rogers is buried for instance instead of the one saddle now slung over the stair railing more than a dozen saddles once sat on racks in the living room on guided tours visitors travel through the family wing of the house including a sitting room music room bedrooms and rogers study a battered typewriter sits on a desk in the study along with a metal sculpture of a polo player and books supported by horse bookends the chair next to the desk holds a well-worn polo hat and polo balls and a large free-standing globe has air routes traced on it in ink including the fatal august 1935, flight to alaska photos of family and friends william s hart and w c fields line the walls wrote on the road ironically less of rogers writing was done here than one might think many of his columns were written with his typewriter perched on his knees wherever he might be in an airplane a car on a movie set on a world tour in russia south america china or japan in fact when rogers was home he spent as much time as possible outside roping playing polo riding the trails or dining on the patio connecting the two wings of the ranch house it was a wonderful place to grow up jim rogers recalls from his home in bakersfield my great memories of the place are predominantly centered around the polo field around the barn where we used to rope calves up in back both sons played polo with their father and the will rogers polo club carries on the tradition on saturdays at 2 p m and sundays at 10 a m weather permitting cowboy's sport it may seem incongruous to some that cowboy rogers loved polo as much as he did but not to attorney joel laden who operates the stable concession at the park he says polo is a cowboy's game and the ultimate game for anyone who loves to ride horses rogers also loved to ride trails up into the santa monica mountains bill rogers says his father was forever creating new trails he would get a couple of ranch hands point and say now let's get a trail from here to there brush would be cleared and he would have a new trail this was typical of the will rogers style of ranch planning according to both sons dad was very impatient about things jim recalls if he wanted something done he wanted it done yesterday and when he decided to do something he just went ahead and did it bill rogers says the tennis court next to the theater and docent shop is a perfect example it is not an official tennis court you cannot play tennis on it it's about 10 feet too short and he didn't care plans for park today careful planning must go into preserving the park and promoting rogers and his ideals without changing the basic character of the historical site parking for instance is a problem because there are fewer than 500 parking spaces and pacific palisades has prohibited weekend parking on nearby residential streets on a warm pleasant weekend it's sometimes difficult to find a parking space in the afternoon more parking spaces would make the park accessible to more people but it also could change the character of the park we are now in the process of developing a general plan for this unit says terry brann supervising ranger for the east sector of the state parks santa monica mountains district he hopes the plan will include ways to draw more park visitors into the house and visitors center he sees the park as a piece of american history that's unique but rangers have conducted informal surveys of visitors and discovered that the majority of the people are there to enjoy the recreational activities and aren't aware of rogers life educational purpose that is something that jo ann wilkinson president of the 140-member will rogers docents wants to change i think it's a teaching thing more than a playground wilkinson says i think the historical part is much more important wilkinson a pacific palisades resident and a self-proclaimed will rogers addict says her docents serve as history teachers part of the fun of being a docent at a historical site wilkinson says is that pretty soon you realize you are helping keep that thing intact you are an important part of history yourself by being there one docent who literally has embraced the rogers persona is actor ben wilson who resembles rogers originally from alabama wilson first visited the park about a year ago purchased one of rogers books and began to develop a program including rope tricks he's developed rogers rhythm and mannerisms when conducting tours he dresses in jeans and denim jacket and wears a well-worn hat atop his sandy-blond hair he performed at the docents party honoring rogers birthday on nov 4 and hopes to develop a program he can take to local schools and eventually perform on stage wilkinson believes the fun part about rogers is that he pretends to be the humble boy just a poor country fella the real thing is that he was very sophisticated very deep philosophically and if you really look at the things he said they're very intellectual current events most of rogers humor was based on current events with many barbs at the press and politicians his stage routines lectures and columns frequently started with all i know is what i read in the papers grammar or no grammar his comments were insightful and much of what he said and wrote about current events more than half a century ago still applies today for instance any man that thinks civilization has advanced is an egotist we've got more toothpaste on the market and more misery in our courts than at any time in our existence or you can't say civilization don't advance for in every war they kill you in a new way or politics ain't worrying this country one tenth as much as parking space never blame a legislative body for not doing something he said when they do nothing that don't hurt anybody when they do something is when they become dangerous things in our country run in spite of government not by the aid of it we shouldn't elect a president we should elect a magician jim rogers says the lasting value of his father's words is based on truisms like aesop's fables human nature never changes people still go around making the same mistakes they made 10,000 years ago and will make 10,000 years from today if we're still here will rogers state historic park 14253 sunset blvd pacific palisades hours 8 a m to 6 p m daily admission is 3 per vehicle 2
