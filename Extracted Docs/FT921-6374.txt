the rules that determine capital gains tax the tax you pay on profits from investments are complicated and frequently illogical cgt can apply to profits made from the sale of such investments or possessions as shares of all forms unit trusts valuable items such as antiques and property other than your main residence you do not pay anything unless your net gain for the tax year exceeds a threshold of pounds 5500 which excludes most people nor can you be taxed until you have sold your investment and realised a capital gain so you do not pay cgt if your shares have had a great year but you are still holding on to them nor are you taxed on any investments which have not kept track with inflation you are taxed only on the amount by which your investment has beaten the retail prices index rpi this is known as the indexation allowance its calculation is complicated but each month the inland revenue releases new tables that show how much rpi has risen for every month since march 1982 these are published monthly in the weekend ft an example will illustrate the process assume that you had bought shares at a total cost of pounds 5000 in september 1984 the indexation value in december 1991 was 1506 in other words prices had increased by around 50 per cent since 1984 you would therefore multiply pounds 5000 by 1506 to find your indexed cost if you had sold this would have come to pounds 7530 had you sold your shares in december whether you made a taxable gain or a loss would have depended on whether the proceeds were above or below pounds 7530 if you made no other capital gains during the current tax year then the proceeds could have been as much as pounds 13030 the indexation allowance of pounds 7530 plus the threshold of pounds 5500 before you needed to pay any cgt broking and dealing costs can be taken into account in calculating your cgt base costs and sale proceeds gains can be offset against losses elsewhere in your portfolio shares which have risen in value since you bought them can still count as losses after indexation if after indexation gains outweigh losses in your portfolio by less than pounds 5500 for a year you pay no cgt cgt does not affect income from investments such as the dividend on shares or the rent from second houses these are taxed as income but your top income tax rate and the size of your income if you are a basicrate taxpayer determines the rate of cgt you have to pay how can you minimise cgt one of the most important techniques is the bed breakfast deal where you sell shares one afternoon and buy them back the following morning the transaction costs involved are not negligible so you should take the advice of brokers and accountants before doing this bb deals are most useful when you have already made gains in the current tax year which take you over the threshold a bb deal to establish a loss elsewhere in your portfolio can save you a specific amount of tax which you know you would otherwise have had to pay you can also use bb deals to take your gains for the year up to the threshold this is more speculative it may save you tax in the future but it may not so look carefully at the brokers fees and the likely overnight price spread before going to market some gilt unit trusts which hold a proportion of international bonds provide cgtefficient investments they invest in bonds which pay out high interest but are unlikely to grow in value this can provide you with a high income and also establish a loss for cgt purposes to be offset against gains elsewhere in your portfolio a final irritating point to note as the result of an attempt to simplify the tax all gains and losses on investments bought before april 6 1982 have now been rebased to march 31 1982 in theory any gains made on investments before that date have effectively been written off in practice this move has added many new complexities if you are holding on to shares from a long time back you should take the advice of an accountant about rebasing cgt is so unpopular at present that labours plans have not caused much political controversy but it is as well to note that the rules might change if there were a change of government the threshold would come down by pounds 1000 or more and there might also be an increase in the rate charged labour wants a reform to encourage longtermism the rate of tax paid would grow less the longer the investment were held thus shortterm stock market stagging would be penalised
