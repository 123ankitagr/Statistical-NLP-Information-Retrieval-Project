The state Department of Health Services will hold a public meeting Thursday to discuss studies of cancer and other risks for residents near the BKK Corp. landfill . The studies said cancer rates near the 583-acre landfill are about the same as in Los Angeles County overall . However , people living near the landfill face a slightly higher risk of cancer than the U.S. average -- two additional cases per 100,000 residents . The meeting will start at 7:30 p.m. at the West Covina Library meeting room , 1601 West Covina Parkway .
