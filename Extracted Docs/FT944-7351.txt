Mr Rupert Murdoch 's Star television , the satellite network based in Hong Kong , bolstered its tenuous foothold in China yesterday when officials approved limited distribution of its movie channel in Beijing . Broadcast authorities confirmed a Beijing Daily 's report that new rules had been issued allowing narrow segments of the population to apply for licences and signal decoders needed to watch Star 's satellite movie channel . The rules mainly affect foreign tourists in hotels and foreigners and overseas Chinese in special housing compounds , but include three-star hotels patronised mainly by local Chinese . Star television is controlled by Mr Murdoch 's News Corporation . Using AsiaSat-1 , its footprint covers north Asia with four channels in English or Chinese and a movie channel , whose signal is encrypted .
