The first of two giant concrete towers ( pictured right ) , which will support the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong , has reached a height of 100 metres , eight weeks after construction began . When the project is completed in mid-September the concrete tower , located on Tsing Yi , will be 190 metres - the same height as some of the modern 50-storey office buildings in Hong Kong 's central district . Work on the second 190-metre concrete tower , at the Ma Wan end of the bridge , is expected to begin in August and be completed in three months . The towers are being built by a process known as slipforming , which accelerates the speed at which concrete can be poured . The forms - or shutters - which surround the concrete move steadily upwards . Steel trusses weighing up to 185 tonnes each will be installed to brace the tower legs temporarily as concrete work proceeds . The trusses will eventually be encased in reeinforced concrete and prestressed to the tower legs . The bridge is being built under a contract awarded last May to the Anglo-Japanese Construction Joint Venture .
