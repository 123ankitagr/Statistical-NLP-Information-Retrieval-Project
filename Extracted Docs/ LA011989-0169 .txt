U.S. industry operated at its highest rate in nine years last month , the government reported Wednesday , but analysts said the modest pace of growth should allay fears of increasing inflation . Use of industrial capacity at factories , mines and utilities rose 0.1 percentage point to 84.2 % last month , the highest rate since it hit 84.3 % in November , 1979 , the Federal Reserve said . The operating rate for November , 1988 , was a revised 84.1 % , and October 's figure was 84.0 % . In an accompanying report , the agency said industrial production climbed a moderate 0.3 % in December following a revised increase of 0.4 % in November . While high operating rates can cause concern that factories will have trouble meeting demand , resulting in shortages and higher prices , economists said December 's increases were small enough that they did n't point to higher inflation . Lawrence Chimerine of the Wefa Group , consultants in Bala-Cynwyd , Pa. , said the reports were `` consistent with continued recovery in the industrial sector and moderate growth in the economy as a whole . '' `` It 's probably the best of both worlds , '' he said . `` It showed continued expansion but at a moderate pace . '' Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co. International in New York said that while operating rates were high , the specter of inflation `` does n't seem to be as much on our doorstep as some people have pretended . '' On the other hand , Brusca expressed concern that production `` is not increasing fast enough to satisfy domestic demand and to make progress '' on the U.S. trade deficit , which widened to $ 12.5 billion in November .
