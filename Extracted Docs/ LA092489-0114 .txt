The Alaska criminal trial for fired Exxon Valdez Capt . Joseph Hazelwood has been delayed until early next year . The significance of the case prompted prosecutors and defense lawyers to suggest a delay , and during a hearing , a state Superior Court judge canceled the Oct. 30 trial date and set Jan. 8 for the start . Hazelwood , 43 , is free on $ 50,000 bail . He faces three misdemeanors -- operating the tanker while intoxicated , reckless endangerment and negligent discharge of oil -- and three felony counts of criminal mischief . Hazelwood 's lawyers have filed motions to dismiss some of the charges . The defense also is seeking to move the trial out of the small town of Valdez . Hazelwood was in command of the Exxon Valdez when it ran aground March 24 , spilling nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound .
