CH Bailey , the ship repairing and diversified engineering contractor , cut its pre-tax losses from Pounds 807,209 to Pounds 305,604 in the 28 weeks to October 11 1991 . The company said , however , that the results - where turnover fell 28 per cent to Pounds 2.1m - reflected the 'pessimistic comments ' in the last statement . Losses per share were reduced to 0.47p ( 1.44p ) after another period when no tax was levied . The company expressed concern that another bill had been presented to parliament for approval to build a barrage across Cardiff Bay , thereby making ship repairing at Bailey 's Bute Dry Dock impossible without 'substantial capital expenditure and long-term guarantees of tenure ' . Also the head office and the woodworking company would have to be relocated , the company said . Bailey is petitioning against the bill .
