Coach Mike Stone 's failure to lodge a protest at the appropriate time apparently has doomed Reseda High 's chances of reversing the forfeiture of a baseball game at Monroe on Tuesday . Stone filed a protest with the City Section on Wednesday , the morning after the Mid-Valley League game that was called in the top of the eighth inning with the score tied , 6-6 . Umpire Ted Comerford ordered the game forfeited to Monroe when he ruled that Reseda pitcher Tony Valdez faked an injury in order to force a pitching change . Stone admits that he ordered Valdez to fake the injury after he threw one warm-up pitch in the eighth inning . Comerford , a 23-year-old Cal State Northridge student who has officiated for six years , admitted Wednesday that he was wrong when he refused to allow the change . Valdez already had pitched 1 2/3 innings and could be removed at any time . However , Comerford called the forfeit for what he called Reseda 's willful violation of the rules . `` They were making a mockery of baseball , '' he said . `` To see a coach do that , to see him set that kind of example for a team , it broke my heart . '' Because the forfeit was based on an umpire 's judgment , a protest has little chance of succeeding , according to City Section Commissioner Hal Harkness , who added that Reseda 's case would have been strengthened had Stone protested when he was forbidden to change pitchers . The protest will be officially reviewed at next month 's meeting of the Interscholastic Athletic Committee . `` I 'd do the same thing tomorrow , '' Stone said in defense of his actions on Tuesday . He may get his chance . The teams play again today at 3 p.m. at Reseda .
