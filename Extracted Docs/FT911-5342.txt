sir i have rather more confidence than richard tomkins pile-up in the great car economy april 9 that the government's road improvement programme will reduce traffic congestion while it is true that total route mileage will increase by about 2 per cent the improvement programme concentrates on providing extra capacity by widening rather than lengthening the existing inter-urban road network under the government's proposals for england the capacity of the trunk road network which carries one-third of all traffic and two-thirds of goods traffic will grow by about 45 per cent this will involve improvement of about one-third of the existing network estimated to be incapable of coping with forecast traffic at the turn of the century the remaining two-thirds of the trunk road system is estimated to have adequate capacity to meet future demand to beyond the turn of the century provided the programme is fully implemented we can meet inter-urban traffic demand for the foreseeable future mr tomkins analysis becomes far more relevant in urban areas where increases in capacity will be minimal but at the same time traffic growth in those areas will be far lower nevertheless urban problems could be eased if through traffic could be removed from towns and villages on to bypasses having removed through traffic from towns and villages attention can be turned to the local traffic but it should not be assumed that it can simply be catered for on an improved public transport system evidence from britain and western europe shows that previous improvements in public transport have mainly benefited existing users who find themselves with a more convenient service those improvements have done little to encourage drivers to leave their car at home it may well then be necessary to use a stick perhaps road pricing to encourage more use of public transport in such areas but advocates of traffic restraint should be aware of a recent study in stockholm which concluded that the imposition of road pricing would result in an 8 per cent reduction in city centre retail trade how many towns and cities would pay that price to reduce their traffic congestion richard diment deputy director british road federation pillar house 194-202 old kent road se1
