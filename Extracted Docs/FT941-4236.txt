germanys worst recession since the second world war has caught up with the countrys highly regionalised commercial property market rents fell across the board last year and there is a growing volume of empty space as building projects commissioned before the downturn come onto the market according to muller international immobilien a german commercial property consultant average rents for prime office space dropped from dm51 a sq m to dm45 a sq m over 1993 a fall of about 12 per cent the volume of unoccupied property surged in germanys 12 leading cities from 14m sq m in 1992 to 24m sq m in 1993 up more than 70 per cent the data conceal sharp regional differences muller found that germanys main commercial centres suffered a much more severe recession than the middleranking cities for example the volume of space let in cologne and hanover was at exactly the same level in 1993 as in 1992 while in dresden and leipzig coupled with essen in the ruhr area of northern germany there was a sharp increase in volume of space rented out these three cities all represent young office markets at an early stage of development muller comments in the east german cities the market also benefited from a high level of pentup demand although this was not enough to stop a 17 per cent fall in rents in leipzig the picture for the more highly developed office markets in dusseldorf frankfurt hamburg and munich was much worse rentals fell by 29 per cent in munich and 24 per cent in berlin while the volume of space let fell by a dismal 49 per cent another negative factor was the surge in unoccupied space which in the 12 cities surveyed by muller climbed from 14m sq m in 1992 to 24m sq m in 1993 add in a slight increase in the volume of space under construction to 52m sq m and the volume of available space after prelettings and owneroccupation rose to a record 67m sq m 4 12 times the level of space let last year in frankfurt which retained its position as germanys leading office property market in terms of rentals levels and volume of space let the volume of unoccupied space has surged in the past two years including peripheral locations and offices under construction the volume of unoccupied space in frankfurt stands at 13m sq m five times the 250000 sq m let last year up until the 1991 building boom unoccupied space had for years averaged a modest 150000 sq m notwithstanding the space overhang the future of the frankfurt market is far from bleak the decision to site the future european central bank in frankfurt will consolidate the citys role as continental europes leading financial centre independent of this decision foreign banks have steadily devoted greater resources to the german market it is the international flavour of the frankfurt office market with demand dictated to a large extent by foreign financial institutions which has driven the fall in rentals in the city last year the highest rent achieved was dm75 a sq m a long way from the neardm100 a sq m levels of 199192 when the world economy recovers it is to be expected that foreign institutions will continue to upgrade their commitment to finanzplatz germany germany as a financial centre to frankfurts advantage in other cities the property downturn was triggered more by the domestic recession munich was the worst hit reflecting the impact of the recession on sectors such as electrical engineering computer technology aerospace and vehicle manufacture all strongly represented in the bavarian capital berlin has also suffered as a result of the recession but the political doubts hanging over the citys future another negative for the office property market have to some extent been lifted by the german parliaments reaffirmation that berlin will become reunited germanys capital by the end of the decade with the german economy making at best a slow recovery in 199495 and at worst entering into the second stage of a doubledip recession the german office property market is set for further consolidation an underpinning of the market is however likely to come from international investors looking for bargains and from the domestic openended property funds a form of investment vehicle which has proved highly popular with individual investors over the past year according to mr oscar kienzle head of knight frank rutleys german operations there is dm10bn invested in the funds pentup demand equivalent to half a years normal purchasing activity this money must by law be invested in property and is likely to provide healthy liquidity support for the german market
