no intelligent consumer would buy a car without first taking it for a test-drive so what about computer products car buyers go to a showroom when they want to try a new model but buyers of computer systems can now evaluate hardware or software without ever leaving their desks digital equipment corporation the us computer maker is allowing users of the internet the self-regulating global computer network to test the company's alpha computers by using their own software programs on its hardware without having to go near the machines users via the internet can tap into one of four alpha computers located in the us by activating a standard internet file transfer protocol they can then transfer their software to a dec machine and effectively use the hardware from any range so far more than 7,500 users internationally have logged-on to try out dec machines and test its product claims of speed and efficiency james bishop faculty fellow in the department of physics at the university of notre dame indiana says that when hardware had to be shipped to customers for testing time was wasted the scheme also reduces dec's marketing costs we only have to manage a handful of machines connected to the internet rather than running many systems in the marketplace or loaning out a large inventory says russ jones dec's marketing manager some users log on to the alpha system in order to test their own programs software developers for example use dec machinery to evaluate new codes before attempting to market them while software users use alpha equipment to check for bugs in their own systems we have been encountering problems in running certain software on our systems says ignacio lizardo an engineer at united technologies corporation's chemical systems division in san jose california by transferring our program codes to the dec systems we can determine if it is a problem with our system or see if we need to make hardware upgrades dec believes the internet allows for more rigorous testing of its products the fact that it is in the public domain on the internet allows people to satisfy themselves that it is a robust system when they combine the hardware with their own software says olivier dewandre programme manager for education and research at dec europe software buyers can also test packages before they hand over their cash unipalm the uk's largest provider of internet connections allows network users to run several programs via the internet before deciding to purchase users who want an evaluation copy of a software program are given a key not unlike an atm pin number that allows them to download programs on to their systems the programs are time-bombed' so that they work only for a limited period if you like the program you get in touch with us and we will sell you a permanent key says a unipalm spokesman
