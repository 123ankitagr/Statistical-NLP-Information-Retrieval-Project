U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar proposed sending 625 military and civilian personnel to Central America in the first major U.N. peacekeeping operation in the Western Hemisphere . However , State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler hinted at U.S. concerns about the plans and refused to say whether Washington would support it or exercise its Security Council veto to squash the proposal . The effectiveness of such a contingent would mean there is agreement among the five major powers , including the United States , to cut off aid to the Nicaraguan Contras and the insurgents in El Salvador .
