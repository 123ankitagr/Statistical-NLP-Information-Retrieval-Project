Another childhood cancer case has been discovered in the tiny Kern County farming town of McFarland . The latest victim is a 5-year-old boy who state health officials said has lymphoma . He is the 13th confirmed childhood cancer victim in the town of 6,200 in the last 14 years . Dr. Lynn Goldman , the epidemiologist in charge of the state investigation into the McFarland cancer cluster , said : `` I think it 's an indication that the above-normal cancer rate is continuing to occur since you do n't expect even half of a case a year to occur in a community of that size . New childhood cancer cases were found in the community in 1987 , 1988 and now in 1989 . '' State and county officials still have not found a clear cause for the McFarland cancer cluster and the investigation is continuing . Goldman said nine types of cancer have been involved among the 13 confirmed cases in McFarland .
