State Sen. Ernest L. Passailaigue said Wednesday that he will introduce a resolution in the South Carolina General Assembly next week , asking the commissioner of baseball to clear the name of Shoeless Joe Jackson . Jackson and seven other Chicago White Sox players were accused of throwing the 1919 World Series to Cincinnati in return for money from gamblers in what became known as the `` Black Sox scandal . '' A jury found the players not guilty of attempting to `` defraud the public , '' but Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis banned them from baseball for life . The ban has kept Jackson from being considered for the Hall of Fame -- an honor many think he deserves given his .356 average is the third highest on record . Passailaigue said his interest in Jackson was piqued recently by an article in a Charleston ( S.C. ) newspaper and the movie `` Field of Dreams , '' which portrays Jackson as a resurrected hero .
