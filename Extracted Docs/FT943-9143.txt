the possibility that britains last operating tin mine south crofty near redruth might close down raised emotions in cornwall but it created not a ripple of interest elsewhere in an industry decimated over the past 10 years by mine and smelter closures those left in the industry are obsessed by one question when will the chinese government gain tighter control over its recalcitrant tin miners and stop them pouring exports into the west these exports they claim are destabilising the market and preventing tin producers from benefiting from the improvement in world economic activity we expected the tin price to reach about dollars 6000 a tonne by now says mr fidelis madavo tin specialist at the cru international consultancy group but here it is struggling along at dollars 5000 to dollars 5100 the tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a price support scheme operated by the producers international tin council which was backed by the governments the huge stocks accumulated by the itc more than 40000 tonnes have been a malign influence on prices ever since tin had already been struggling in the early 1980s because a big chunk of its market for beverage cans was being won away by aluminium producers this trend started in north america where aluminiums share of the beverage can market has risen from 15 per cent in 1973 to 93 per cent and it has been a growing threat in other industrialised countries too also thinner coatings of tin are being used on tinplated steel cans nor have the metals main other uses been particularly buoyant its use in solders now the principal application increased throughout the 1980s as did its use in chemicals but in 1993 tin consumption was 30 per cent below its peak 20 years previously in an effort to whittle away the former itc stocks a group of producers formed the association of tin producing countries its aim to voluntarily restrict exports the scheme has not worked well unexpected and unrestrained exports from brazil not a member of the atpc caused havoc in the early years then china now the worlds biggest producer continued to pump large quantities of the metal into export markets the collapse of the former soviet union once a substantial consumer of tin added to the producers difficulties today the atpc faces its greatest challenge because after much persuasion china joined in april this year but it has flagrantly been exceeding its export quota china agreed to limit its tin exports in 1994 to 20000 tonnes the official china daily reported at the beginning of this month that in the first half alone the country exported 24700 tonnes a 33 per cent increase on the same months of 1993 the atpc is a toothless tiger and should be disbanded said one analyst reflecting a widelyheld view in the industry the china daily also reported that the chinese government would tighten up on tin exports in the second half of this year it did not however say how do the authorities really have control over shipments says mr andy shaw tin specialist at the metals minerals research services consultancy group china has said it will adhere to certain atpc recommended limits on exports in previous years even though it has not been a member but of course it hasnt mr shaw suggests that if it had not been for chinas exports of refined tin during the past few years the stocks overhang which was left as a legacy of the collapse of the international tin council could have been more or less drawn down by now crus mr madavo expects chinas refined tin exports to slow in the second half of this year but the 1994 total will probably exceed the 3200033000 tonnes exported last year china also ships out tin in concentrate an intermediate material and when this is taken into account the export total could rise to 4000045000 tonnes traditional tin producers are being forced to deliver their metal into london metal exchange warehouse mr madavo says lme stocks which totalled 20000 tonnes at the end of last year have climbed to 30000 tonnes and where cru was earlier forecasting that western world demand for tin would outpace supply this year it now seems there will be a supply surplus consumption is forecast to rise by just over 1 per cent from 168000 tonnes last year to 170000 tonnes and while western world production is expected to shrink from 141000 tonnes to 135000 tonnes that would not be enough to allow chinese exports to be easily absorbed the market also has to cope with steady selling from the us strategic stockpile which disposed of 6900 tonnes last year nevertheless analysts tend to be relatively bullish about tins longerterm prospects the international tin research institute recently suggested that demand could be boosted by 20 per cent within five years with a number of new applications due to reach the market soon these include a tinzinc alloy for plating car components inorganic tin compounds for fireretardant packaging leadfree tin alloy for gunshot antimonytin solders with a higher tin content than present leadtin solders and tin bottle capsules used instead of lead on top of this british steel has announced that its ultimate can for beverages is ready for commercial production this can developed with other european tinplate producers is said to be 30 per cent cheaper than its aluminium equivalent mr angus macmillan research manager at billitonenthoven metals part of the royal dutchshell group says we are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for tin demand over the next decade the decline in consumption in tinplate has run its course even before we consider the implications of the ultimate can but if producers are to enjoy the benefits of higher demand when it eventually arrives they must act to reduce stocks
