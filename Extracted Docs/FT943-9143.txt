the possibility that britain's last operating tin mine south crofty near redruth might close down raised emotions in cornwall but it created not a ripple of interest elsewhere in an industry decimated over the past 10 years by mine and smelter closures those left in the industry are obsessed by one question when will the chinese government gain tighter control over its recalcitrant tin miners and stop them pouring exports into the west these exports they claim are destabilising the market and preventing tin producers from benefiting from the improvement in world economic activity we expected the tin price to reach about dollars 6,000 a tonne by now says mr fidelis madavo tin specialist at the cru international consultancy group but here it is struggling along at dollars 5,000 to dollars 5,100 the tin market has been in turmoil since the sudden collapse in 1985 of a price support scheme operated by the producers international tin council which was backed by the governments the huge stocks accumulated by the itc more than 40,000 tonnes have been a malign influence on prices ever since tin had already been struggling in the early 1980 s because a big chunk of its market for beverage cans was being won away by aluminium producers this trend started in north america where aluminium's share of the beverage can market has risen from 15 per cent in 1973 to 93 per cent and it has been a growing threat in other industrialised countries too also thinner coatings of tin are being used on tin-plated steel cans nor have the metal's main other uses been particularly buoyant its use in solders now the principal application increased throughout the 1980 s as did its use in chemicals but in 1993 tin consumption was 30 per cent below its peak 20 years previously in an effort to whittle away the former itc stocks a group of producers formed the association of tin producing countries its aim to voluntarily restrict exports the scheme has not worked well unexpected and unrestrained exports from brazil not a member of the atpc caused havoc in the early years then china now the world's biggest producer continued to pump large quantities of the metal into export markets the collapse of the former soviet union once a substantial consumer of tin added to the producers difficulties today the atpc faces its greatest challenge because after much persuasion china joined in april this year but it has flagrantly been exceeding its export quota china agreed to limit its tin exports in 1994 to 20,000 tonnes the official china daily reported at the beginning of this month that in the first half alone the country exported 24,700 tonnes a 33 per cent increase on the same months of 1993 the atpc is a toothless tiger and should be disbanded said one analyst reflecting a widely-held view in the industry the china daily also reported that the chinese government would tighten up on tin exports in the second half of this year it did not however say how do the authorities really have control over shipments says mr andy shaw tin specialist at the metals minerals research services consultancy group china has said it will adhere to certain atpc recommended limits on exports in previous years even though it has not been a member but of course it hasn't' mr shaw suggests that if it had not been for china's exports of refined tin during the past few years the stocks overhang which was left as a legacy of the collapse of the international tin council could have been more or less drawn down by now cru's mr madavo expects china's refined tin exports to slow in the second half of this year but the 1994 total will probably exceed the 32,000 33,000 tonnes exported last year china also ships out tin in concentrate an intermediate material and when this is taken into account the export total could rise to 40,000 45,000 tonnes traditional tin producers are being forced to deliver their metal into london metal exchange warehouse mr madavo says lme stocks which totalled 20,000 tonnes at the end of last year have climbed to 30,000 tonnes and where cru was earlier forecasting that western world demand for tin would outpace supply this year it now seems there will be a supply surplus consumption is forecast to rise by just over 1 per cent from 168,000 tonnes last year to 170,000 tonnes and while western world production is expected to shrink from 141,000 tonnes to 135,000 tonnes that would not be enough to allow chinese exports to be easily absorbed the market also has to cope with steady selling from the us strategic stockpile which disposed of 6,900 tonnes last year nevertheless analysts tend to be relatively bullish about tin's longer-term prospects the international tin research institute recently suggested that demand could be boosted by 20 per cent within five years with a number of new applications due to reach the market soon these include a tin-zinc alloy for plating car components inorganic tin compounds for fire-retardant packaging lead-free tin alloy for gunshot antimony-tin solders with a higher tin content than present lead-tin solders and tin bottle capsules used instead of lead on top of this british steel has announced that its ultimate can for beverages is ready for commercial production this can developed with other european tinplate producers is said to be 30 per cent cheaper than its aluminium equivalent mr angus macmillan research manager at billiton-enthoven metals part of the royal dutch shell group says we are cautiously optimistic about the prospects for tin demand over the next decade the decline in consumption in tinplate has run its course even before we consider the implications of the ultimate can but if producers are to enjoy the benefits of higher demand when it eventually arrives they must act to reduce stocks
