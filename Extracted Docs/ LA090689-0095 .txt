Yorba Linda , which once fought to be designated as the official birthplace of former President Richard M. Nixon , now wants to declare his birthday a city holiday . `` President Nixon is definitely in fashion again , '' declared Yorba Linda Mayor Henry W. Wedaa , who proposed the Jan. 9 holiday for city employees . The City Council voted 5-0 Tuesday night to request a resolution designating the holiday . In two weeks , the council will decide whether to create a new holiday or substitute Nixon 's birthday for an existing city holiday . `` I think this is a fine idea , '' said Councilman Mark Schwing . In his travels , Wedaa said , he finds that people rarely bring up the Watergate scandal that forced Nixon 's resignation in 1974 . Rather , people often recognize Yorba Linda as Nixon 's birthplace and the home of the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library , which is scheduled to be completed next year , he said . `` This often leads to many positive comments about what a great president history is showing him to be , '' Wedaa said , adding that he hopes that the Nixon Library will schedule special events to coincide with the new Nixon holiday . Yorba Linda has aggressively staked out its Nixon turf , but the road has n't always been smooth . Several years ago , Yorba Linda and Whittier , where Nixon grew up , argued over which city could claim him as a native son . It was agreed that Yorba Linda would be Nixon 's birthplace , and Whittier would be Nixon 's hometown .
