Britain 's official bumfpushers are using an amended version of Omar Khayyam 's famous line as their watchword for elaborating on the Citizen's Charter . In their case , 'The moving finger writes ; and having writ , writes more . ' Already this week the Benefits Office 's customer 's charter has been followed by the Customs & Excise traveller 's charter . But although the first has been dubbed the scrounger 's charter , it would be in appropriate to nickname the second the smuggler 's charter , because it has somewhat strayed from the point of the original exercise . Whereas the idea behind such documents was to set out what users of a service have a right to expect from the officialdom running it , the latest effusion concentrates on the responsibilities the traveller owes to the customs . For instance , Point 2 instructs : 'Your first step is to decide if you have anything to declare . . . . ' By Point 5 you 're told that it is only when you have n't that you should enter the green channel . Point 8 is more permissive , however , in providing for duty to be paid not just in Pounds sterling , but by cheque or credit card . And Point 12 , while stating that travellers must unpack and repack luggage if so asked , concedes that customs officers will help with repacking unless 'operational circumstances ' prevent it . What next ? A police charter telling us to uphold the law , with perhaps a reminder that 'operational circumstances ' may oblige us to sign any statement put before us ?
