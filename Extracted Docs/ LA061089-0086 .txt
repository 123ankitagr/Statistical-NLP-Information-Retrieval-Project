in a major revision of what is considered one of the toughest rentcontrol ordinances in the nation the santa monica rent control board will allow landlords to roughly double the rents on some apartments if they set aside an equal number of units for lowincome tenants at lower rates members of the rent control board which approved the changes thursday night and landlord representatives said at a joint press conference friday that the voluntary program addresses the two major problems facing rent control today making inexpensive housing available to poor people while providing landlords with a fair return on their investment its a workable compromise and its recognition that after 10 years of a restrictive ordinance financial incentives are needed for the landlord said carl j lambert president of action a santa monica landlords group susan packer davis chairwoman of the rent control board said that while the board has agreed to allow sizable rent increases for some vacated apartments the poor the elderly and disabled people for whom rent control was originally intended to help will be protected were still being idealistic but finding a pragmatic way of achieving our goals she said both sides agreed that a change was needed landlords have left as many as several thousand apart ments vacant rather than rent them out at what they considered unreasonably low rates meanwhile many highincome professionals some paying thousands of dollars in underthetable finders fees were moving into two and threebedroom apartments near the beach for less than $ 500 a month we needed to do something to keep rent control viable and to be more responsive to the needs of the 1990s said wayne bauer a rent control board commissioner renters make up 80 of santa monicas 90000 residents of the estimated 40000 rental units 34000 are subject to rent control the average monthly rent is slightly under $ 500 in effect sept 1 the socalled voluntary inclusionary housing program which will go into effect sept 1 was first proposed in 1984 the city charter was then amended to permit such a change in the citys rent control ordinance which was adopted into the city charter in 1979 but it was only in february that the board adopted a program it allowed landlords to raise rents on a number of apartments equal to those set aside for lowincome and very lowincome tenants landlords were allowed a $ 300 increase for apartments set aside for lowincome tenants and a $ 500 increase for units guaranteed for very lowincome tenants lowincome tenants are those making less than 80 of the areas median income very lowincome residents are those making less than half of the median a family of four would qualify as lowincome if it had a total annual income of $ 30400 it would qualify as very lowincome with a total annual income of $ 19950 increases dismissed landlords ignored the program however dismissing the increases as minimal and objecting vehemently to a provision that required them to record the agreement with the title to their property for 30 years landlords said this would lower the value of their property recognizing that the program was not working members of the rent control board began negotiating with landlord representatives two months ago and agreement was reached last week this is an olive branch that is being offered from each side board member bauer said the program approved thursday night allows larger rent increases under the same onetoone ratio for lowincome units it also contains a provision that could reduce rents for some lowincome tenants something the old ordinance did not provide unlike the earlier program it does not require any changes in property titles rate schedule rents for the apartments set aside for lowincome tenants would be determined by a rate schedule tied to a percentage of the areas median income or by the apartments current rent whichever is lower for example a family of four with an income of $ 30400 is assured of renting a threebedroom apartment for no more than $ 618 or a family of four with an income of less than $ 19950 could rent a threebedroom unit for $ 412 we tried to ensure that lowincome people would pay no more than 30 of their annual incomes said mary ann yurkonis administrator of the rent control board were trying to ensure that the affordable units go to the people who need them the most in exchange for guaranteeing units for lowincome tenants landlords will be able to raise rents on other vacated apartments by $ 400 and $ 900 depending on the size of the apartment and whether the unit set aside is for a low or very lowincome tenant extra incentive there is an extra incentive of $ 100 per month for setting aside a lowincome unit for a tenant with children and an extra $ 50 per month for a lowincome tenant with a pet the higher rates will put santa monica more in line with prevailing rates in other westside communities craig l marcus a grubb ellis co investment property broker earlier this year released a study on apartment rents in the westside that showed the average rent for a twobedroom apartment in westwood was $ 1500 a month because most of the units under rent control in santa monica are older marcus said they will have to be substantially refurbished to get rents close to $ 1500 a month hopes for program supporters of the program are hoping that with higher profits landlords will refurbish their buildings some of which have been allowed to deteriorate there is also hope that many of the apartments that landlords decided to keep vacant an estimate that ranges from a handful to several thousand will return to the housing market santa monica mayor dennis zane a rent control advocate who disputes the notion that a significant number of highincome tenants live in rentcontrolled apartments called the program a step in the right direction prior to now rent control could only provide security to existing renters and lowincome renters already in the community zane said we now have the ability to provide greater assurances in the long run of a mixed demographic environment revisions to rent control law the old law under the rent control law in effect since 1979 rental units are treated essentially the same regardless of the tenants income the rent control board has limited annual rent increases to an average of 45 per year for 10 years the result is that the average monthly rent in santa monica is $ 480 far below the prevailing rate in nearby parts of los angeles critics of the law say the biggest beneficiaries of the law have been highincome professionals whose rents have been kept artificially low city officials also believe that dissatisfied landlords are keeping as many as several thousand rental units in santa monica vacant rather than rent them at the low rates the new law the new law is designed to give landlords a financial incentive to rent to poor tenants particularly the elderly families with children or people with handicaps the law will allow landlords to raise the rent substantially on apartments when they are vacated in return the landlords would be required to set aside an equal number of apartments for lowincome renters the amount of rent the landlord forgoes by renting to the lowincome tenant would be more than offset by increases on the deregulated apartments officials hope the incentives will encourage landlords to rent many of the vacant units that are now being kept off the market who qualifies the law establishes two categories of poor tenants lowincome and very lowincome as defined by federal formulas examples in santa monica a family of four is classified as very lowincome if it makes less than $ 19950 a year and lowincome if it makes less than $ 30400 monthly rents for poor tenants would be determined by the tenants income and the size of the apartment for lowincome tenants the rent could be as low as $ 399 for a oneroom apartment and as much as $ 618 for one with three bedrooms for very lowincome tenants the range would be $ 266 to $ 412 the incentives for each vacated unit set aside for a lowincome tenant landlords would be allowed to raise the rent as follows on vacated units rented to regular tenants single $ 400 one bedroom $ 500 two bedrooms $ 600 three or more bedrooms $ 700 for each vacated unit set aside for a very lowincome tenant the following increases would be allowed on vacated units rented to regular tenants single $ 600 one bedroom $ 700 two bedrooms $ 800 three or more bedrooms $ 900 example a landlord has two vacancies at the same time in onebedroom apartments each now earning the citywide average of $ 480 per month giving him a monthly total of $ 960 under the new law he rents one to a verylow income tenant for $ 320 in return he is able to raise the rent on the other apartment to $ 1180 giving him a monthly total from the two apartments of $ 1500
