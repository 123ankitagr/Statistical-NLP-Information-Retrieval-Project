eighthgrade writing scores improved overall in california schools but four orange county public school districts fell below the state average this year state education test results showed monday four other orange county school districts showed declines in writing scores although they remained above the state average according to the state department of education which released results of a second year of testing eighthgrade students for their writing abilities because orange county has a higher average income and education level for adults than the rest of the state the countys school districts usually score well above state averages in statewide academic tests but results this year showed that anaheim union high school district la habra elementary school district santa ana unified school district and westminster elementary school district all had writing scores below the state average 2 were behind last year only two orange county school districts anaheim union high school and garden grove unified scored below the state average last year the first year of the new writing tests for eighthgraders statewide garden grove unified this year showed a 20point increase bringing its ranking above the state average but anaheim union high school district fell below the state average in writing for the second consecutive year the four school districts in the county scoring lower this year than last but still above state average were capistrano unified irvine unified ocean view elementary and los alamitos unified los alamitos dropped 19 points this year compared to last but remained well above the state average capistrano unified irvine unified and ocean view all showed very slight declines of one or two points this year breaolinda unified school district which had a writing score well above state average last year for its eighthgraders did even better this year the district jumped 54 points the biggest improvement gain this year among the 21 orange county school districts with eighthgraders we have a new writing program in our school system and we expect to do even better next year breaolinda supt edgar seal said but for the four school districts in the county with scores below the state average the test scores were disappointing the scores in our school district are not only a disappointment they are also a mystery because we simply dont know why our scores are lower westminster elementary school district assistant supt keith lawson said the overall state test results released monday in sacramento showed that 62 of the states eighthgraders wrote adequate or marginally adequate essays twelve percent wrote impressively and 22 wrote poorly according to the results 1 of 6 essays the statewide exam begun last year asks students to write one of six specific types of essays such as an autobiographical sketch or an informative report last spring 271168 eighthgraders took the writing exam each student was given 45 minutes to write an essay each exam was given a score ranging from 1 to 6 which state officials translated into a scaled score running from about 100 to 400 the average score statewide rose 6 points this year from last year going from 250 to 256 state supt of public instruction bill honig said monday that he is very pleased with the increases in orange county 17 of the 21 school districts with eighth grades had overall scores higher than the statewide average of 256 for the second year in a row the topscoring orange county district in eighthgrade writing was laguna beach unified with a current test score of 344 compared to 335 last year like breaolinda unified laguna beach unified has only one middle school or junior high with an eighth grade other school districts in the county generally have several eighthgrade schools edged laguna one school in fountain valley actually scored higher than the laguna beach district eighthgrade students at fulton school scored 366 the highest in orange county on the writing tests this year last year that honor went to marine view school in huntington beach marine view this year had a score more than 100 points above the state average its tally of 359 slightly trailing fulton school but ahead of laguna beachs overall district score santa ana unified school district last year scored above the state average in eighthgrade writing despite having a high percentage of new immigrant students who know little english the writing tests are given in english santa ana unifieds score this year was 248 or 8 points below the state average of 256 i think the scores this year reflect an increase in the limitedenglishproficient students we have in our district santa ana unified assistant supt anthony dalessi said this year we gained 2000 new lep limitedenglishproficient students and our district is now 52 lep compared to 50 a year ago so there is a reason for our score but having said that i can still say our district wants to be above state average as we were last year and we will be working to improve our scores he added a little concern an official at anaheim union high school district on monday expressed a little concern about the eighthgrade writing again falling below the statewide average but the new test scores dont mean were qualitatively lower but that were qualitatively different said jim cox the anaheim districts director of research and evaluation this is a new test its only in its second year and for us its one of those cases where the test came before the change in curriculum cox said explaining that the anaheim district is revising its curriculum to reflect stateordered changes for all language arts programs literature is quite heavily involved in that new curriculum and weve emphasized literature he said the last element of the new curriculum weve implemented is writing and im guessing that some districts introduced writing first in making curriculum changes because the state writing program and the state writing test is very very sophisticated its going to take some time for our writing curriculum to reach the level we want but we will be there cox pledged la habra elementary school district assistant supt ruth fehr noted that while scores for her district were down this year they were within comparison bands meaning that the school districts scores were about the same as other districts having the same socioeconomic factors doesnt know the reason we dont know any particular reason for the writing scores to be down this year fehr said we have a writing program were committed to and it begins in the first grade we also have strong emphasis on writing in our new language arts curriculum were going to continue to work to get those scores up she added the writing test results released monday also showed a decrease for los angeles unified school district the largest in the state los angeles unified had an average score of 208 this year markedly below the 256 statewide average and a point lower than the districts 209 score last year many educators nationwide consider the california exam stateoftheart according to the education commission of the states a denverbased research group that advises states on educational policy the majority of the 22 states that test students writing used the california test as their model because thousands of essays must be read scoring is a laborious process last year 384 teachers in six locations around the state spent six days grading the essays state officials said the state computes a schoolwide and district score but not individual student scores the test is designed to show a school the strengths and weaknesses in its approach to the teaching of writing orange county grade 8 writing assessment test scores school 198687 198788
