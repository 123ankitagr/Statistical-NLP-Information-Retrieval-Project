Eighth-grade writing scores improved overall in California schools , but four Orange County public school districts fell below the state average this year , state education test results showed Monday . Four other Orange County school districts showed declines in writing scores , although they remained above the state average , according to the state Department of Education , which released results of a second year of testing eighth-grade students for their writing abilities . Because Orange County has a higher average income and education level for adults than the rest of the state , the county 's school districts usually score well above state averages in statewide academic tests . But results this year showed that Anaheim Union High School District , La Habra Elementary School District , Santa Ana Unified School District and Westminster Elementary School District all had writing scores below the state average . 2 Were Behind Last Year Only two Orange County school districts -- Anaheim Union High School and Garden Grove Unified -- scored below the state average last year , the first year of the new writing tests for eighth-graders statewide . Garden Grove Unified this year showed a 20-point increase , bringing its ranking above the state average . But Anaheim Union High School District fell below the state average in writing for the second consecutive year . The four school districts in the county scoring lower this year than last , but still above state average , were Capistrano Unified , Irvine Unified , Ocean View Elementary and Los Alamitos Unified . Los Alamitos dropped 19 points this year , compared to last , but remained well above the state average . Capistrano Unified , Irvine Unified and Ocean View all showed very slight declines of one or two points this year . Brea-Olinda Unified School District , which had a writing score well above state average last year for its eighth-graders , did even better this year . The district jumped 54 points -- the biggest improvement gain this year among the 21 Orange County school districts with eighth-graders . `` We have a new writing program in our school system , and we expect to do even better next year , '' Brea-Olinda Supt . Edgar Seal said . But for the four school districts in the county with scores below the state average , the test scores were disappointing . `` The scores in our school district are not only a disappointment , they are also a mystery , because we simply do n't know why our scores are lower , '' Westminster Elementary School District Assistant Supt . Keith Lawson said . The overall state test results released Monday in Sacramento showed that 62 % of the state 's eighth-graders wrote adequate or marginally adequate essays . Twelve percent wrote impressively , and 22 % wrote poorly , according to the results . 1 of 6 Essays The statewide exam , begun last year , asks students to write one of six specific types of essays -- such as an autobiographical sketch or an informative report . Last spring , 271,168 eighth-graders took the writing exam . Each student was given 45 minutes to write an essay . Each exam was given a score ranging from 1 to 6 , which state officials translated into a scaled score running from about 100 to 400 . The average score statewide rose 6 points this year from last year , going from 250 to 256 . State Supt . of Public Instruction Bill Honig said Monday that he is very pleased with the increases . In Orange County , 17 of the 21 school districts with eighth grades had overall scores higher than the statewide average of 256 . For the second year in a row , the top-scoring Orange County district in eighth-grade writing was Laguna Beach Unified with a current test score of 344 , compared to 335 last year . Like Brea-Olinda Unified , Laguna Beach Unified has only one middle school ( or junior high ) with an eighth grade . Other school districts in the county generally have several eighth-grade schools . Edged Laguna One school in Fountain Valley actually scored higher than the Laguna Beach district . Eighth-grade students at Fulton School scored 366 , the highest in Orange County on the writing tests this year . Last year , that honor went to Marine View School in Huntington Beach . Marine View this year had a score more than 100 points above the state average -- its tally of 359 slightly trailing Fulton School but ahead of Laguna Beach 's overall district score . Santa Ana Unified School District last year scored above the state average in eighth-grade writing , despite having a high percentage of new immigrant students who know little English . The writing tests are given in English . Santa Ana Unified 's score this year was 248 , or 8 points below the state average of 256 . `` I think the scores this year reflect an increase in the limited-English-proficient students we have in our district , '' Santa Ana Unified Assistant Supt . Anthony Dalessi said . `` This year , we gained 2,000 new LEP ( limited-English-proficient ) students , and our district is now 52 % LEP , compared to 50 % a year ago . So there is a reason for our score . `` But having said that , I can still say our district wants to be above state average , as we were last year , and we will be working to improve our scores , '' he added . ' A Little Concern ' An official at Anaheim Union High School District on Monday expressed `` a little concern '' about the eighth-grade writing again falling below the statewide average . But the new test scores `` do n't mean we 're qualitatively lower , but that we 're qualitatively different , '' said Jim Cox , the Anaheim district 's director of research and evaluation . `` This is a new test ; it 's only in its second year , and for us , it 's one of those cases where the test came before the change in curriculum , '' Cox said , explaining that the Anaheim district is revising its curriculum to reflect state-ordered changes for all language arts programs . `` Literature is quite heavily involved in that ( new ) curriculum , and we 've emphasized literature , '' he said . `` The last element ( of the new curriculum ) we 've implemented is writing , and I 'm guessing that some districts introduced writing first ( in making curriculum changes ) . '' `` Because the state writing program and the state writing test is very , very sophisticated , it 's going to take some time for our writing curriculum to reach the level we want . But we will be there , '' Cox pledged . La Habra Elementary School District Assistant Supt . Ruth Fehr noted that while scores for her district were down this year , they were within `` comparison bands , '' meaning that the school district 's scores were about the same as other districts having the same socio-economic factors . Does n't Know the Reason '' We do n't know any particular reason ( for the writing scores to be down this year ) , '' Fehr said . `` We have a writing program we 're committed to , and it begins in the first grade . We also have strong emphasis on writing in our new language arts curriculum . '' `` We 're going to continue to work to get those scores up , '' she added . The writing test results released Monday also showed a decrease for Los Angeles Unified School District -- the largest in the state . Los Angeles Unified had an average score of 208 this year -- markedly below the 256 statewide average -- and a point lower than the district 's 209 score last year . Many educators nationwide consider the California exam state-of-the-art . According to the Education Commission of the States , a Denver-based research group that advises states on educational policy , the majority of the 22 states that test students ' writing used the California test as their model . Because thousands of essays must be read , scoring is a laborious process . Last year , 384 teachers in six locations around the state spent six days grading the essays , state officials said . The state computes a school-wide and district score but not individual student scores . The test is designed to show a school the strengths and weaknesses in its approach to the teaching of writing .
