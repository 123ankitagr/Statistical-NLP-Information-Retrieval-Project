Anyone who has been near a radio anytime in the last 17 years probably knows these lyrics : `` Bye-bye Miss American Pie , Drove my Chevy to the levee , but the levee was dry . . . . '' But do you remember who wrote them ? If it took you longer than a few seconds to answer , then you have some idea of the upheaval that the last 17 years have brought Don McLean . It has taken most of that time for McLean to put some distance between himself and `` American Pie , '' the monster hit that he wrote and sang and that became the object of relentless scrutiny for its abstruse lyrics . `` I kind of shot myself in the foot back there in 1972 because I raised expectations so high , '' McLean said of his best-known record during a recent phone interview . `` So much happened around that song that it was very hard for Don McLean to crawl out from under it . '' In a very real sense , McLean , who does about 85 performances a year , has been battling to avoid the stigma of being a one-hit wonder . `` I felt that my albums were excellent and my songwriting was excellent , and people were missing out on a lot that I had to offer , '' McLean said . `` My relentless concertizing has probably done a lot to change that . '' McLean 's new label , Gold Castle , will release each of his last six albums over the next 3 years . He will continue touring this summer , then spend 6 weeks in Britain before returning for a November date at Carnegie Hall .
