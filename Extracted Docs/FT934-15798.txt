THE Republic of Turkey may have its credit rating lowered from investment to sub-investment grade to reflect its deteriorating public finances . Moody 's , the international credit rating agency , announced yesterday that it has placed Turkey 's long-term credit rating under review for possible downgrading . The decision has come at an awkward time for Turkey as it was hoping to launch a Eurosterling bond issue next week . Turkey currently has a Baa3 credit rating , the lowest investment grade rating available from Moody 's , which covers about Dollars 6.2bn of long-term debt . Moody 's cited 'the steady deterioration of Turkey 's public finances ' as the reason for putting the rating under review , adding that the consolidated budget deficit in 1993 could exceed the 13.8 per cent of GDP reached in 1992 , while inflation may be rising again .
