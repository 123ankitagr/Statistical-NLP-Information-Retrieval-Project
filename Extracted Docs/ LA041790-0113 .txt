Rockwell International earned $ 173.4 million on sales of $ 3.15 billion in its second quarter ended March 31 , a decline in net income but a small increase in operating profit over the same period last year , the El Segundo firm said Monday . Rockwell said prior-year second-quarter earnings were $ 270.7 million , which included a $ 104-million after-tax gain on the sale of its Measurement & Flow Control division . Sales were virtually unchanged . Aerospace sales and earnings were down compared to the same period a year ago , while the firm 's electronics segment was up on strength across a number of commercial and industrial segments . `` Our results for the first six months were better than we anticipated when the fiscal year began , '' said Donald R. Beall , chairman and chief executive . `` Based on our current assessment of the economy , our outlook for the full 1990 year is for modest earnings-per-share improvement over 1989 , before last year 's 40-cents-per-share gain from the sale of a business . '' The aerospace earnings declined in the 1990 period because the comparable 1989 period `` benefited from more favorable contract adjustments in aircraft and space programs , '' the company said . Rockwell 's aircraft , space systems and defense electronics segments all showed declines in sales . Its graphics and automotive groups reported higher sales .
