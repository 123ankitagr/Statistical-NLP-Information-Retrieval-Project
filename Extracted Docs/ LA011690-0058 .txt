the unwanted mountain crisscrossed by dirt-bike trails and littered with trash and old tires rises up out of south-central los angeles sprawling across several hundred empty acres of state-owned land it is literally a mountain of dirt and over the last 15 years or so it and the open fields around it have become an illegal playground for motorbikes and other off-road vehicle users as well as a place to dump rubbish this land south of imperial highway between normandie and western avenues was cleared for the 2-billion century freeway project the state got the mountain free because california department of transportation engineers thought they were going to need fill dirt on the freeway project so when southwest college was built at imperial and western the state asked for the dirt excavated from the campus building site they got it all 150,000 to 200,000 cubic yards now caltrans has decided it no longer needs the dirt and the future of the mountain is uncertain according to paul in a caltrans engineer at first the state was going to run the freeway right through where the mountain now stands he said our original alignment took the dirt out in explained however caltrans is now looking for ways to cut costs and leaving the dirt in place may be one way to save money he said it could be cheaper to reroute the highway around the mountain that news doesn't make father david o'connell happy not one bit o'connell a normally cheery irishman gets angry when he talks about the mountain and its impact on st frances x cabrini catholic church and parish school the church and school are in the shadow of the mountain and day in and day out the motorbikes snarling up and down makeshift trails make it hard to teach the children and conduct mass the priest has told state officials he wants the noise abated by a wall or screen of trees in addition the exploding gopher populations that are migrating from the dirt mountain into the cabrini baseball diamond have ruined the field o'connell said there are 300 students enrolled in the elementary school but no ball field to play on we're trying to have a place for the children to play but we can't do it not with all of this o'connell said as he gestured toward the abandoned field pocked by gopher holes and that isn't all they use that mountain for a dump he added pointing to refuse piles of old tires and other debris directly behind the church another thing that concerns us is that they've found hazardous wastes under the mountain o'connell said he is concerned that toxic waste from an old dump may be kicked up in the dust clouds if and when the mountain is finally hauled away as o'connell talked about his concerns recently a pickup truck drove up one of the mountain's muddy makeshift roads and two young men unloaded a four-wheel all-terrain vehicle they had come out for a spin i've been coming here since i was 9 or 10, rocky baggett 23, yelled over the roar of the engine the carson resident said he comes here often adding it's a real popular place to ride with that he zoomed up the hill and out of sight when confronted with the priest's complaints caltrans officials agree only that the mountain belongs to the state they are reluctant to say that it is causing problems but they also are looking into o'connell's complaints we are studying what to do said caltrans deputy district director conrad barber efforts have been made to chase away the gophers but he conceded they haven't been too successful as for the dirt bikes that flock to the area on weekends caltrans spokesman in said that's a law enforcement problem it's difficult to keep the dirt bikers out the area is posted and it's against the law to trespass or dump refuse in the area state police officials said however they don't have the manpower or equipment to enforce the law the uncertainty over the route and at what level the freeway will be built through the area means that no decisions can be made yet on the dirt mountain in said as for the toxic waste he said the site was an unauthorized dump before caltrans bought it and does contain heavy metals no decision has been made on how this problem is to be handled he said
