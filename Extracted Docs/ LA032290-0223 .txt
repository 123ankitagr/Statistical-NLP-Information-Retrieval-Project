if one of the goals of regular testing is to help shape what goes on in the classroom then state and local education officials have reason to be cheered by results of a statewide survey that looks at the newly revised california assessment programs writing exam to show continued success on the cap writing test schools must develop a multiyear approach to writing instruction that crosses all grade levels and subject areas state supt of public instruction bill honig said when the test results were made public in february and that is apparently what is happening the statewide survey by two college professors showed that the writing exam is having an effect on the english curriculum in junior high and middle schools professors sandra murphy of san francisco state university and charles cooper of uc san diego sent their survey to eighthgrade teachers at 600 randomly selected schools and more than 90 of english teachers responding said the test will strengthen the curriculum at their schools the annual test administered to 308000 eighthgraders last spring covers eight types of writing all essays must be completed in 45 minutes and each is scored to measure thinking and writing process skills as well as such mechanics of writing as spelling and grammar more than 90 of the survey respondents also said they have already changed the way they teach writing because of the test and 78 said they now make more writing assignments four types of writing autobiographical incident evaluation problem solution and report of information were introduced when the writing assessment program was launched in 1987 firsthand biography and story were added in 1988 followed last year by the addition of observational writing and speculation about causes or effects a writing exam for 12thgraders was begun in the fall of 1988 and will be fully implemented with eight tests this november state officials are considering whether to add writing tests for sixthgraders and possibly even for thirdgraders how to read the scores here are the schoolbyschool results of the california assessment programs writing exam that was administered to eighthgraders throughout the state last spring the exam consists of eight tests of writing ability and represents the states biggest step to date away from the muchcriticized multiplechoice method of testing academic achievement results are listed by school district and by individual school so that parents can compare the performance of youngsters in their community with that of students in the rest of los angeles county and throughout california schools are listed alphabetically by district because the exam was changed substantially last year with the addition of two more writing tests only the latest round of scores is listed the
