A new step toward protection against the common cold has been taken by researchers at Boeringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Ridgefield , Conn . They reported in the journal Nature last week that they have discovered a way to trick rhinoviruses , which cause more than half of all colds , into not infecting cells in the nose . Their work relied on the discovery last year by two groups of researchers that the rhinoviruses bind to a specific receptor , called ICAM-1 , on the external membrane of cells in the nasal passage . If the viruses do not bind to the receptor , they do not infect the cells . Molecular biologist Steven D. Marlin and his colleagues used genetic engineering techniques to make multiple copies of a form of ICAM-1 that could be dissolved in water . When they sprayed a solution of the receptors onto the surface of nasal cells grown in the laboratory , they found that the receptors tied up all the rhinoviruses to which the cells were subsequently exposed , thereby preventing infection . The next step will be to try the soluble ICAM-1 in living animals .
