it is time to blow the whistle on london undergrounds jubilee line plans to extend it to docklands at a cost of pounds 17bn have been rendered redundant by the financial collapse of canary wharf to proceed with the project now could be the railway equivalent of building concorde this is not an assertion that many outside the treasury will wish to hear but the facts argue in its favour to set them in context it is worth dwelling for a moment on the projects history extending the underground to docklands and the rest of londons eastern hinterland is not a new idea the jubilee line had two previous incarnations in the 1970s first as the fleet line running from the west end to the city before turning southwards through wapping to lewisham and second as the river line following the same course to the city but then serving the isle of dogs and thamesmead the financial case for these projects however never stacked up and after the oil price crises of the 1970s the then labour government was in no mood for extravagance so while a vestige of those earlier plans survives in the form of a pair of empty tunnels running forlornly under the streets of london eastwards as far as aldwych the passengercarrying part of the renamed jubilee line never stretched beyond its present terminus at charing cross when in 1981 the conservative government set up the london docklands development corporation to oversee the regeneration of docklands it had to look again at east londons transport needs but an underground line from the west end costing more than pounds 1bn still looked an absurdly expensive proposition in the context of the modest regeneration then envisaged instead the government opted for the construction of the docklands light railway on a shoestring budget of just pounds 77m that might have been the end of the story had it not been for the reichmann brothers but when they and their private property company olympia york arrived in 1987 with their grandiose scheme to turn the the isle of dogs into a business centre rivalling the west end and the city the transport plans were thrown into chaos contrary to popular myth the government was not tardy in its response rather it reacted with astonishing speed and generosity within months it was carrying out detailed work on the options for improving docklands transport infrastructure the east london rail study was published in january 1989 and in november that same year a bill to authorise construction of the jubilee line extension went before parliament some pounds 35bn was committed to roads the underground line and the upgrading of the docklands light railway meanwhile central london crippled during the boom years of the late 1980s by appalling congestion and decaying infrastructure was left to rot the biggest single factor underlying this investment in docklands infrastructure was the prediction that the canary wharf development would boost the number of jobs in docklands to 150000 by the year 2005 canary wharf alone which today houses fewer than 4000 people was predicted to provide jobs for up to 55000 on completion but canary wharfs financial collapse and the death of the commercial property market have pushed those forecasts into the realms of fantasy if they are ever achieved it will not be until at least a decade later than expected it is too late however to delay much of the transport infrastructure by this time next year the bulk of the pounds 165bn docklands roadbuilding programme the biggest road programme in britain will be complete leaving the area with excellent access for buses coaches taxis and cars unlike the city or the west end docklands will also benefit from cheap and almost unlimited parking the docklands light railway meanwhile will have been transformed from its present toytown railway status to an urban mass transit system some pounds 800m has been spent on extending the line to bank in the city and beckton in the east and by next year the lines capacity will have risen from its 1987 level of 15000 passengers a day to 15000 passengers an hour few transport planners would dispute that with this infrastructure in place the combined capacity of all transport modes to docklands will be adequate well beyond the jubilee lines planned opening date of 1996 so does it not make sense to shelve the jubilee line extension until it is needed and get on with more pressing projects the jubilee line extensions advocates answer that to do so would seal docklands doom with the jubilee line in place canary wharf could still fulfil its creators dream of becoming a third london business centre without it the development can never hope to be regarded as anything other than a secondrate outoftown location for clerical and backoffice functions the difficulty with this argument is that it contains an element of wishful thinking there is little likelihood that that canary wharf would fulfill its creators dream in the foreseeable future even if the jubilee line were in place and the treasury will rightly question whether such a large expenditure of taxpayers money should be gambled on such an uncertain outcome meanwhile there are many other transport projects in london to which investment could be usefully diverted and which in pure transport terms deliver greater benefits per pound than the jubilee line london transport though extremely reluctant to abandon the jubilee line after investing so much time and money in it has started to draw up an emergency list of projects it could bring forward in its place the longoverdue upgrading of the existing underground system the stepping up of the station modernisation programme an acceleration of the planned northern line upgrade and the possibility of bringing forward the pounds 17bn paddingtonliverpool street crossrail project by a year are among the benefits that would accrue to londoners in the next five years if only the jubilee line extension were postponed even that would only soak up pounds 600m to pounds 700m with the change from pounds 17bn the government would have enough to console everyone working at canary wharf with a free rolls royce and still save the taxpayer money
