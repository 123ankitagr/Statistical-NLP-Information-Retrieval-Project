A 33-year-old Christmas episode of `` I Love Lucy '' made the Top 10 in the Nielsen ratings and was CBS ' highest-rated show for the week ended Dec. 24 . The show , starring Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz , was sixth in the ratings . It was the first telecast of the black and white episode since Dec. 24 , 1956 . NBC 's `` Cheers '' was the top show , ABC 's `` Roseanne '' was second , and to the surprise of no one , NBC was the top-ranked network overall . CBS pulled its own surprise by finishing second for the second week in a row . ABC was third . Fox Broadcasting 's `` Married . . . With Children '' plunged to a tie for 72nd place after the series ' Christmas special the week before was 13th . That was the highest rank achieved so far by a Fox show . It was not a great week for Christmas specials , other than the demonstration that Lucy can still pull in an audience . CBS ' `` Frosty the Snowman '' was 20th , CBS ' `` A Very Brady Christmas '' was 21st . CBS ' `` Charlie Brown Christmas '' tied for 30th , CBS ' `` Claymation Christmas '' tied for 41st , NBC 's `` Christmas in Washington '' tied for 56th , and CBS ' `` A Christmas Carol '' tied for 62nd .
