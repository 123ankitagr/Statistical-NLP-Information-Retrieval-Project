It was with growing anger that I read the article ( Metro , Dec. 10 ) detailing Robert Brock 's desire for `` reparations '' for black Americans . To say that I , a 26-year-old white American , am responsible for things done to long dead black Americans by equally long dead white Americans is an affront to intelligence . Brock would have , I suppose , all white Americans have a special tax levied on them because of their race . This would be done in order to punish white people for the sins of their race . Is this not the worst sort of racism ? Is this not the same of thinking that Hitler had toward the Jews ? Rather than ever submit to a plan like Brock 's , I would die fighting it . What still amazes me is that you at The Times would run this trash . MARK EDWARD NOONAN Van Nuys
