The latest barricade behind which French politicians are mustering in the interminable Gatt negotiations is not wheat but popcorn . They say French cinema is being engulfed by Hollywood . But they are drawing strength from Germinal , Claude Berri 's newly released film version of the tough novel by Emile Zola . In its first week in Paris , Germinal shot straight to number one , attracting an audience of 170,000 . Its nearest rival - the Hollywood film The Fugitive -only managed 86,000 . Germinal is now hailed as France 's bulwark against US invasion . But the Parisian intelligentsia - regarded as prehistoric in some quarters - faces a short-lived victory . Other dinosaurs - featuring in Jurassic Park , the movie - arrive in Paris on Wednesday .
