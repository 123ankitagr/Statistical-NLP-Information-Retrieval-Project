eric show three weeks before he will surely be the padres openingday starting pitcher has begun complaining about lower back pains caused by what was diagnosed in january as a bulging disc although show has proven he can pitch well in his condition he was outstanding monday in pitching a threehit shutout over six innings against the milwaukee brewers he says he is in pain at other times and will wonder about the back until it is tested over a fullgame situation he threw about 60 pitches monday he would normally throw around 110 its fine now but the minute it affects my motion or my delivery or any of that im going to see what needs to be done show said monday i will pitch with pain ive pitched with fractured fingers broken toes but i will not pitch where it is hurting the team or myself although show said an option would be the same kind of surgery performed on san francisco quarterback joe montana i could be back in four to six weeks good as new he said his doctor said such talk is premature his is not a surgical lesion thats not where its at right now said dr daniel denenberg a san diego orthopedic surgeon who performed a test which revealed shows condition denenberg said the bulging disc could have been there for quite some time perhaps even throughout last summer when show led the padres with a 1611 record and 326 earnedrun average our findings are that the disc is irritated but its not something that just occurred denenberg said its been there for a while and been compatible with his wellbeing hes obviously performed with it it just started bothering him so we took a look the thing now is to wait and see sometimes the waiting is easy as in mondays game in which show put up the best numbers of any padre starter this year striking out four and walking two the padres wound up losing his 40 lead when reliever greg booker put up the springs worst numbers allowing eight runs seven earned in two innings in an eventual 84 loss if shows back is hurt and he throws like that maybe his back should stay hurt manager jack mckeon said seriously show looks fine to us and we are not worried other times though the waiting is hard i felt great today show said but tomorrow ill be hurting ill be walking around like he stuck out his hand as if holding an imaginary cane and began hobbling around his locker on certain movements it just hurts show said like bending over show first complained of the soreness in january and underwent tests that revealed the problem but caused little worry show noted about 80 of the people in this country have bulging discs and its no problem for most of them both he and his agent steve greenberg were asked about the back during the first week of camp and both denied any serious problems i thought the soreness would go away show said but it hasnt yet teammates recently noticed show complaining of the pain during everyday situations such as riding the team bus show said his problem now is believing that pain wont occur on the field ive got to get rid of it as far as the psychological aspects are concerned show said ive got to go six or seven innings and see if its fine and if its not fine ill do my best to ignore it show said but only to a point where i cant ignore it pat dobson padre pitching coach said that as far as shows position in the rotation was concerned dobson also would ignore the back pains i check with him about it all the time but it doesnt seem to bother him once he gets loose so i wont do anything until he comes to me dobson said i think maybe its tough on him the day after he pitches and i bet that if he gets involved in any long innings in the cold it could be a problem but well just get a hot pack on him while hes on the bench and that should take care of it dobson and the other coaches met with mckeon over dinner monday night to discuss roster moves and among other things the opening day starter april 3 in san diego against san francisco by virtue of his careerbest performance last season show was a lock for the job the minute he stepped into camp and still is a lock he has looked decent in all three spring outings going 10 with a 375 era do i want to be the opening day starter sure show said somebody has to start the season so sure why not if shows season in interrupted because of back problems minor league star greg harris who was 20 with a 150 era in three appearances with the padres last fall appears ready for a shot at a rotation he now can not crack padre notes although eric shows back condition could change things pitching coach pat dobson revealed monday that the club might go with only nine pitchers instead of the standard 10 why not if we have our starters going so many innings like last year what do we need the extra bullpen man for dobson asked such a switch would allow the padres to keep an extra utility man maybe backup shortstop candidates mike brumley and gary green could both make the team green was given an inning at third base monday the losing pitcher could be rookie greg harris who is scheduled to make the team in the bullpen even though he is a starter just for the bigleague exposure and in case a starter were injured mondays loss dropped the padres spring record to 641 while shooting greg bookers spring era to 2025 nine earned runs in four innings carmelo martinez hit his third homer of the spring a tworun shot in the fifth the padres play two more games in the phoenix area before returning to yuma for their remaining nine home games begining friday at 705 against san francisco mckeon has scheduled a b game with the giants beginning at 3 pm friday at desert sun stadium
