Andy Fraser is gleeful about his new role as managing director of the advertising agency Collett Dickenson Pearce . Having spent the last 11 years with Saatchi and Saatchi , 41-year-old Fraser thought it was time for a change . And nowhere better to head towards than CDP , where his Far East experience will come in useful - and where the Japanese ad giant Dentsu has 43 per cent . A Sussex university graduate in English and American studies , Kuala Lumpur-born Fraser spent four years in Thailand - where he arrived in 1976 - to take over as head of McCann Erickson 's office and make his mark as one of their youngest ever managers . He speaks the musical Thai language 'reasonably ' , some achievement in view of his admission that he is 'tone-deaf ' . Fraser is one of a handful of key Saatchi executives who have departed in recent months , though he goes without acrimony - ' I 'll never have a word said against them ' .
