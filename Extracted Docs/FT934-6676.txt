president bill clinton yesterday offered north korea the prospect of talks on a thorough broad approach to the issues that divide us but insisted the us was not relaxing its demands nor making any concessions if it abandons its nuclear option and honours its international non-proliferation commitments the door will be open on a wide range of issues mr clinton said after meeting president kim young-sam of south korea at the white house if it does not it risks the increased opposition of the entire international community mr clinton reaffirmed the us unyielding commitment to south korea's security but said the us and south korea were willing to re-examine their policies if north korea was willing to allow inspectors from the international atomic energy agency to monitor its nuclear programme both mr clinton and mr kim appeared to be anxious to play down suggestions they were offering pyongyang a package deal offering specific short-term concessions such as the cancellation of this year's team spirit joint us-south korean military exercise if north korea complied with their immediate demands and holding out longer-term economic and diplomatic gains in exchange for continued co-operation both washington and seoul agree that un sanctions against north korea would not be a particularly attractive option foreign policy experts outside the clinton administration acknowledge the need to negotiate with north korea if only to build support among other countries for tougher measures should the need arise they warn however about the danger of making concessions just to persuade north korea to remain a member of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty while doing nothing about suspect sites believed to be part of a secret nuclear programme
