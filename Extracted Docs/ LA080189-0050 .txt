The American Heart Assn . said it plans to give its own seal of approval -- to be used on labels and in advertisements -- to promote foods low in fat , cholesterol and sodium . Known as HeartGuide , the program would go into effect in February , 1990 , but food manufacturers can submit products for testing now to see if they meet AHA standards , the association said in a statement . The group recommends a diet with less than 30 % of total calories from fat or less than 10 % of calories from saturated fat . It also would limit cholesterol intake to 300 milligrams a day and sodium to 3,000 milligrams a day . Initial food categories to be tested are margarines and other spreads , shortenings and oils , frozen dinners and entrees , canned and frozen vegetables , and crackers .
