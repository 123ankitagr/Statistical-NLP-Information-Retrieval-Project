Sir , Re your story on the Skye toll bridge ( 'Tolls will be steep on the high road to Skye ' , February 10 ) it must be stressed that the agreement with the developer is ' . . . that the actual duration of the toll period would be the period which results in the collection of tolls with a net present value of Pounds 23.6m discounted back to December 1990 at a real interest rate of 6 per cent or 27 years , whichever period is the lesser ' . A 15-year period is based on the most optimistic traffic growth forecast and has credibility only as propaganda with apologists for the high-toll regime .
