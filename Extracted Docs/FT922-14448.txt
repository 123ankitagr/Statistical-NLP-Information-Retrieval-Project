the taiwanese national assembly faces a week-long boycott by opposition delegates as the latest sign of growing discord on the island about whether to move to a directly elected presidency a debate which itself is symptomatic of uncertainty about taiwan's broader constitutional future opposition deputies walked out yesterday after disrupting a speech by mr hau pei-tsun the prime minister and challenging his right to address the assembly but conservative delegates of the ruling kmt party say they will try to keep the topic off the national assembly's agenda altogether in the session which opened last month arguing that there are still four years left until the end of president lee teng-hui's term the main opposition democratic progressive party dpp which holds 75 of the 403 assembly seats has already called for island-wide demonstrations on april 19 the dpp supports a directly elected president but of an independent republic of taiwan this is anathema to the kmt government which still claims sovereignty over the whole of china although taiwan has operated as an independent state since 1949 the debate which is over whether to allow the president to be elected by the taiwanese people rather than by electoral college was apparently initiated in early march by president lee himself within the kmt leadership and erupted into a public row during the party's central committee plenum until now the president has been elected by the national assembly which is also charged with amending the constitution a relic from the days of kmt rule on the mainland before it fled to taiwan in 1949 after losing the war with the communists taiwan has a separate parliament the legislative yuan mr chen pi-chao of the independent institute for national policy research says that the presidency issue is symptomatic of a power struggle which has been endemic in the kmt leadership ever since taiwan-born president lee who is also chairman of the kmt broke the mainlanders monopoly on power when he was elected two years ago ranged on one side are mr lee's supporters the liberal mainstream faction most of whom are native taiwanese and who favour direct presidential elections they have public opinion and most regional assemblies behind them on the other side is the conservative faction mostly of mainland origin supporters of the prime minister who has close connections with the military opinion polls earlier this year showed that a majority of taiwanese favoured direct election of the president if only because it was simpler than other methods other political analysts are concerned that such an election would bring a presidential system in which too much power resides in one person that kind of system is not conducive to the stability of a developing country says professor hu fu of national taiwan university it's too easy for it to turn into a personality cult like the marcos regime in the philippines conservatives in the kmt also argue that direct election of a taiwanese president would be a step closer to formal independence and therefore unacceptable to beijing which has threatened military intervention should the island declare itself independent
