officials from about 30 countries were last night due to finish two days talks on a multilateral steel agreement the first negotiating meeting since negotiations broke up without a deal last march writes frances williams in geneva countries are expected to agree further meetings in a bid to finalise a deal by next february when the uruguay round of global trade talks is due to be concluded but the us and ec remain far apart on how to treat steel subsidies and dumping in the proposed accord the ec insists a deal must address the present spate of us anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits while the us argues the msa should apply only to future actions if agreed the msa would phase out steel tariffs over 10 years scrap non-tariff barriers and outlaw direct state subsidies for steel production but disagreements exist over how far indirect subsidies and curbs on us recourse to anti-dumping and subsidy action should be allowed
