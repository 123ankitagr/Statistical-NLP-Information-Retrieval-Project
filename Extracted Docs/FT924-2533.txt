OFFICIALS from about 30 countries were last night due to finish two days' talks on a multilateral steel agreement , the first negotiating meeting since negotiations broke up without a deal last March , writes Frances Williams in Geneva . Countries are expected to agree further meetings in a bid to finalise a deal by next February , when the Uruguay Round of global trade talks is due to be concluded . But the US and EC remain far apart on how to treat steel subsidies and dumping in the proposed accord . The EC insists a deal must address the present spate of US anti-dumping and anti-subsidy suits , while the US argues the MSA should apply only to future actions . If agreed , the MSA would phase out steel tariffs over 10 years , scrap non-tariff barriers and outlaw direct state subsidies for steel production . But disagreements exist over how far indirect subsidies , and curbs on US recourse to anti-dumping and subsidy action , should be allowed .
