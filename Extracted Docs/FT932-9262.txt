marlboro's declining popularity has certainly smoked out some worries about brand valuation at grandmet due to the appreciation of the dollar brands in its balance sheet increased by pounds 416 m to pounds 2.9 bn in the first half a level equivalent to 76 per cent of net assets such treatment is a long-established habit at grandmet it goes back to the awesome difficulty of accounting for goodwill in food and drink company acquisitions brand accounting is a way of putting such goodwill on the balance sheet without having to depreciate it but the brand valuation then easily becomes a function of how much the acquirer has paid rather than its intrinsic worth grandmet stresses the careful computation of margin volume and cash-flow which is factored into its brand valuations quite so but the result still basically reflects the management's own view and it is striking that none of its brands has ever been down-graded indeed to do so openly would risk trouble consumers would scarcely flock to buy a product whose value to its owners was diminishing it is rather glib for the company to argue that the flagging green giant can still be valued at dollars 392 m and pearle at dollars 99 m because it has resisted the temptation to revalue them upwards in the past one way of maintaining a brand's value is to invest in it grandmet has been doing plenty of that for example with haagen-dazs ice cream in europe but the company generated virtually no cash in the first half and needs to reduce its pounds 3.2 bn debt capital spending is tailing off and the marketing spend is flat albeit at a high level that coupled with more efficient use of working capital may yield some cash whether the brands will still be worth as much is anybody's guess
