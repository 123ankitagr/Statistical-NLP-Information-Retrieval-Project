'It 's possible , ' Joseph-Antoine Bell , the team 's goalkeeper and captain , said last night . Bell , speaking in San Francisco , said the dispute has been going on for some time . The players reportedly have not been paid for two months and it is not clear how much they are owed . 'It 's always the same problem , ' he said . 'The players are not happy . They have not gotten their bonuses , their salaries . ' I know there is a possibility to arrange everything , to solve the problem . But the players are anxious , because nothing has been done . ' Cameroon 's French coach , Henri Michel , acknowledged the financial problems and said it is having a detrimental effect on his players . 'The players have not received pay for games , ' he said . 'The players are losing confidence and they want a guarantee . It 's difficult to concentrate on games . ' No soccer team has ever gone on strike at the World Cup . The Portuguese players considered such action at the 1986 tournament , but the matter was resolved with their federation .
