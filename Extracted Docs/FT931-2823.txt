EFFORTS TO persuade North Korea to allow further nuclear inspections will be stepped up today at a special board meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna , writes David White , Defence Correspondent . The meeting of the agency 's 35 governors follows North Korea 's announcement last week of withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and tension over the Team Spirit US-South Korean military exercises . Mr Hans Blix , IAEA director-general , will report on North Korea 's refusal last month to allow inspection of two sites near its Yongbyon nuclear complex . Evidence from earlier inspections raised suspicions that the country might have separated more plutonium , usable for nuclear weapons , than the tiny amount it has declared . An IAEA official said a North Korean representative might attend the meeting .
