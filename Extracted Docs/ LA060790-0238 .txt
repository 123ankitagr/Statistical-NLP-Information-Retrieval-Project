James Michener wrote a plea to three young men who pleaded guilty to anti-Semitic vandalism : `` Get off that doomed train right now . '' A judge had given the men an unusual sentence : learn about the Nazi Holocaust . Part of the assignment was to read a chapter from the author 's book `` Poland '' on a concentration camp . After learning of the sentence , Michener wrote to the men through the judge , John Carey , who said Wednesday he was moved by the author 's interest . `` Fellows , what you 're doing is wrong , '' Michener wrote . `` You will stain yourselves if you follow that route . Get off that doomed train right now . '' Michael Morano , 18 ; Michael Venturino , 18 , and Neville Anthony Mason , 20 , pleaded guilty to defacing a high school a year ago .
