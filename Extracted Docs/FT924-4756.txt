CLOSER monitoring of personal pension schemes to ensure that any abuses do not go unchecked was promised by Miss Ann Widdecombe , junior pensions minister , in the Commons last night , Ivor Owen writes . She envisaged an enlargement of existing procedures for checking the reliability of undertakings given by those marketing such schemes and the levels of commission charged . Miss Widdecombe assured Mr Archy Kirkwood , pensions spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , that so-called 'front loading ' - where commission eats up most of the initial annual contribution - would be taken into account . Mr Terry Rooney ( Lab Bradford North ) insisted that where abuses did occur suspension of the insurance company or other organisation concerned would not be adequate and that 'meaningful compensation ' should be available to existing holders of personal pensions who had been duped . Miss Widdecombe told him : 'If we were to discover evidence of widespread difficulties or malpractice it would be very much our intention to track all those who have already taken out personal pensions ' . Mr Peter Lilley , social security secretary , moved the second reading of the Social Security Bill , saying 5m people had chosen personal pensions since their introduction in 1988 - 10 times as many as predicted .
