Sir , So Barclays has now instituted a new procedure for approving big corporate loans ( 'Barclays ' new loan procedures ' March 22 ) . Under this new procedure there will always be one senior executive who takes personal responsibility for the loan . For the benefit of those who , perhaps , like myself are not too sure about the way the old procedure worked , how many executives used to be responsible for such loans ; none or more than one ?
