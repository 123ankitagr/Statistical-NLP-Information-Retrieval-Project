MONEY supply growth in Germany continued to be higher than hoped again last month suggesting a further delay in any moves to relax the Bundesbank 's high interest rate policy . A provisional figure of 9 per cent for the M3 broad measure for May was announced yesterday , causing consternation among economists and market analysts . This compares with April 's corrected 8.9 per cent . The central bank blamed unusually strong growth in cash in circulation , in fixed-term deposits and continued strong growth in bank credit . The figure leaves the main money supply measure , used as the key indicator of monetary stability in the German economy , well outside the 'target corridor ' of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent growth fixed by the Bundesbank for 1992 . David Waller adds from Frankfurt : Yesterday 's money supply figures led to a sharp drop in German government bond and bond future prices , with yields on the benchmark 10-year Bund climbing 4 basis points to 8.08 per cent . Expectations had been for a further slowdown in monetary growth from the high point of 9.4 per cent in March . Lex , Page 20
