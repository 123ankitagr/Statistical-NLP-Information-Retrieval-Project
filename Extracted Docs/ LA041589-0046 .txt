Los Angeles radio station KLSX-FM began urging listeners Friday morning to volunteer in the cleanup of the oil spill in Valdez , Alaska , offering plane fare and a week 's accommodations to `` qualified '' people who donate their time and expertise . `` I feel compelled to tell you people to donate your time and money to this cause , '' deejay Peter Tilden said . The station is seeking a `` planeful '' of volunteers to help coordinate the cleanup effort from Anchorage . By the end of Tilden 's morning show Friday , about 200 people had called to volunteer their services , program director Tom Yates said . Among the volunteers were fishermen , oceanographers , environmental scientists , marine biologists and veterinarians , Yates said . Those without such qualifications are being urged to donate money to the cleanup effort . Volunteers `` will primarily be involved in the expedition of a more efficient communications system at cleanup sites in Alaska , '' a station press release said . Jeff Orchard , executive director of the Alaska Voluntary Response Center in Valdez , said he was grateful for the station 's efforts . `` We can really use the help , '' he said . `` We can always use more communication and coordination . It 's a madhouse here . '' The station 's listeners -- who are primarily in the 25-54 age range -- likely consist of people who had been active in social and political causes during the late 1960s and early '70s , Yates said , so the volunteer effort seemed `` a very logical thing for us to do .
