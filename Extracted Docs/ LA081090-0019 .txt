In response to Jesse Jackson 's column `` Lacking a Cold War , U.S . Draws a Blank '' ( Commentary , Aug. 2 ) , again Jackson has proven to be a disappointment in his comments on the civil war in Liberia . Jackson is upset at what he considers `` a weak and inadequate response '' on the part of the U.S . He points out what he claims to be `` a 143-year-old 'special relationship ' `` between the U.S. and Liberia . His `` proof '' that America 's interests are at stake is the one example of the Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. in Liberia . Jackson feels the U.S. should have used armed intervention to stop the civil war . Yet , I 've noticed that Jackson is very selective in his demands for U.S. action . His double standard , as applied to the Middle East for example , is quite evident . Jackson is demanding U.N. Security Forces to stop the Liberian fighting . Yet , he never so demanded to protect innocent Israeli civilians from Syrian and Jordanian terrorist attacks over the last 40 years . He demands `` a massive emergency relief effort '' for Liberia , yet he supports those at home and abroad that would cut off U.S. aid to Israel , a tiny democracy and American ally , in a sea of Arab masses . Speaking of `` special relationships , '' just who does Jackson think the U.S. has to depend on , but Israel , in the developing oil wars of the Middle East . Jackson 's credibility could be greatly enhanced if he simply recognized that fairness must be applied to all persecuted peoples , not just the few that he has a personal or political interest in .
