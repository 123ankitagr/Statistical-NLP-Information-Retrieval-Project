i hate chris willman how could he write such a bad review of new kids on the blocks album step by step june 3 ive heard three of the songs on the album and it already sounds like a hit to me new kids must be all right if they are no 20 on the pop chart already new kids make music that teenagers can relate to thats not all my mom happens to love them why dont you go to a concert and see how many adults go with their kids my mom would never be caught dead at one of my brothers metallica concerts next time you write a review on them remember new kids rule and people will always stick up for them kelly smith los angeles
