I hate Chris Willman ! How could he write such a bad review of New Kids on the Block 's album `` Step by Step '' ( June 3 ) ? I 've heard three of the songs on the album and it already sounds like a hit to me ! New Kids must be `` all right '' if they are No . 20 on the pop chart already ! New Kids make music that teen-agers can relate to ! That 's not all ! My mom happens to love them . Why do n't you go to a concert and see how many adults go with their kids . My mom would never be caught dead at one of my brother 's Metallica concerts ! Next time you write a review on them , remember , New Kids rule ! And people will always stick up for them !
