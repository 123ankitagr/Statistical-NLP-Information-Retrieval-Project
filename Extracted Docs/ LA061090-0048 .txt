i hate chris willman how could he write such a bad review of new kids on the block's album step by step june 3 i've heard three of the songs on the album and it already sounds like a hit to me new kids must be all right if they are no 20 on the pop chart already new kids make music that teen-agers can relate to that's not all my mom happens to love them why don't you go to a concert and see how many adults go with their kids my mom would never be caught dead at one of my brother's metallica concerts next time you write a review on them remember new kids rule and people will always stick up for them kelly smith los angeles
