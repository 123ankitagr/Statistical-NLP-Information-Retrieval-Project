China is to clamp down on foreign borrowings to avoid debt service problems , following a central bank survey that found foreign debt would rise to Dollars 100bn ( Pounds 64.5bn ) by the end of the year . The official Xinhua news agency yesterday quoted an official of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange Control ( Safec ) as saying it was 'time for China to limit its foreign borrowing and use as much direct overseas investment as possible ' . Safec announced last month that China 's foreign debt at the end of 1993 had risen to Dollars 83.5bn . Its debt/service ratio was 7.7 per cent . China will pay Dollars 20bn this year in principal and interest to service its foreign debt . Safec estimates the 'debt repayment peak ' will last for another 3-4 years . Mr Tang Sining , a senior Safec economist , said foreign debt had 'expanded a bit too fast ' in recent years . 'It really deserves our attention that growth of external debt has outpaced that of the national economy , ' he said . China announced recently that its foreign exchange reserves rose 50 per cent during the first half of the year to Dollars 31.8bn . Slower growth in imports contributed to the improvement in China 's reserves .
