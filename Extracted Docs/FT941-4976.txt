the free trade agreement that mexico and costa rica provisionally concluded last week has been described as the most advanced between two latin american countries it will eventually remove tariff and most non-tariff barriers to trade in goods and services between the two countries offer national treatment to investors from each country set rules on intellectual property rights ease movement of workers between the two countries and provide for a panel that resolves disputes arising out of compliance with the accord both countries predicted that the agreement would significantly boost mexican-costa rican trade which stood at dollars 215 m pounds 147.2 m last year however by giving preferential access to each other's markets the agreements will hurt the two countries existing trade partners especially other central american states the negotiations were formally wrapped up last thursday night and the text is being written up by lawyers mexico's trade ministry expects the agreement to be ready in four to six weeks and to be signed by the respective presidents soon after the treaty will take effect from january 1 next year mexico's trade ministry said mexican exports of goods that costa rica did not produce would be able to enter costa rica duty-free from next year this covers about 80 per cent of mexican exports currently at tariffs of about 20 per cent tariffs on the remainder of mexican exports will be reduced over five 10 and for the most sensitive products 15 years mexico in turn will allow a majority of costa rican exports to enter duty-free in five years or less mr jaime serra puche mexico's trade minister said the agreement was without a doubt one of the most advanced trade agreements between any latin american countries he said the pact established a strong rule of origin that requires goods to be made with inputs of the region that is to say from costa rica or mexico and that this is an important opportunity for mexican suppliers of inputs and primary materials since costa rica's supply industry is not well advanced mr roberto rojas costa rica's trade minister described the pact as the first step toward costa rica's accession to the north american free trade agreement between the us mexico and canada an official from mexico's trade ministry said products would have to contain 50 per cent regional content to be considered costa rican or mexican and free of tariffs as mr serra puche made clear such a rule of origin would encourage costa rican companies that export to mexico to source from mexico rather than neighbouring countries what this accord is promoting is alliances and not competition between mexico and costa rica said the official what we are looking for is that costa rican and mexican businessmen work together this is the latest of a series of trade agreements in latin america trade experts from the region meeting in santiago last week were warned in a report from the un economic commission for latin america that there were risks in such agreements in particular bilateral ones it said the benefits of such deals were fewer when integration agreements involve countries that are only minor trading partners it argued there was a possibility that bilateral or even broader integration agreements signed within the region might have restrictive effects with low tariffs such as those that prevail in latin america the benefits of such trade agreements were fewer it said and the accords could include other aspects such as rules of origin that might discourage trade rather than promote it it further suggested that the emergence of certain hub countries with which most bilateral agreements were concluded can also create incentives for the polarisation of investment in these countries mr serra puche hoped the agreement with costa rica would provide a model for similar accords between mexico and remaining central american countries over which negotiations were continuing mexico's trade minister expects to meet this month with counterparts from colombia and venezuela to discuss their free trade agreement the three countries had hoped to sign the treaty in january before president rafael caldera of venezuela took office although mexico claimed in december that negotiations had concluded last-minute differences over rules or origin for chemicals and textiles made signing impossible however the new venezuelan government less keen on free trade than its predecessor is said to have insisted on a re-negotiation of the treaty the mexican government is willing to meet the venezuelans and listen to their concerns but the trade ministry official said the agreement could not be re-opened additional reporting by stephen fidler in london and david scanlan in san jose
