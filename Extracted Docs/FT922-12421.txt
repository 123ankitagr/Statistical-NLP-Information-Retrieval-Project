FOR THE brands of bicycle we remember from childhood it is all change . UK cycle makers have been caught recently in a wave of takeovers . Dawes was bought two years ago by the Dutch group Atag whose main bike brand is Batavus . The UK industrial group Casket , which already controlled Townsend , acquired British Eagle and Falcon . The latter includes the Claud Butler and Holdsworth marques . Derby International which owns the former Raleigh business - Britain 's biggest bike maker - has taken over Kalkhoff of Germany ( renamed Derby Werk ) and is building a factory in eastern Germany . Derby recently failed in an attempt to buy the Peugeot bike business of France . Peugeot then formed an alliance with the Spanish manufacturer , BH , which controls Cycles Gitane in France . Muddy Fox , a UK mountain bike maker is in financial difficulty and is likely to go into new ownership soon .
