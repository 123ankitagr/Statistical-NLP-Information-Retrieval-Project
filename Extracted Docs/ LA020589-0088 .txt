Relocation and mortgage services for transferring U.S. Air Force personnel will be available nationwide through the Century 21 Star program developed by Century 21 Real Estate Corp. and Air Force officials . The national expansion follows a successful test at seven Air Force bases , said Martin Rueter , vice president of regional development for the Century 21 system . It is estimated that the program could save an Air Force member between $ 1,500 and $ 3,000 a move . An Air Force spokesman noted that two-thirds of all Air Force families live off base , and that about 250,000 families are transferred annually .
