the conservatives have won the general election during a recession that is already the longest britain has suffered since world war two and although there are indications of an upturn in the economy later this year unemployment is expected to rise further as a result many more people are likely to face acute financial difficulties these changed circumstances are not confined only to those at the bottom of the income scale many professionals particularly those in the city have been made redundant others who still have a job are all too aware that their future is uncertain but for people worried about meeting their bills there are measures that can be taken draw up a budget while this sounds obvious it is essential you must have an idea of your disposable income and where it is going financial planners suggest breaking it down into essential spending mortgage utility bills marginal needing a new washing machine or car and dispensable holidays newspapers try to remember direct debits for which you no longer have a record but which are leaving your account at regular intervals you could be paying for nonessential goods or subscriptions the budget is also useful if you intend seeing your mortgage lender to negotiate reduced payments reduce your debts this might sound demanding at a time when you fear a loss of income but take the chance while you can afford it to pay off debts that charge high interest such as store cards credit cards and overdrafts this is also not the time to buy a house you can only just afford or to take on longterm inflexible investment policies take out redundancy cover this is pricey but could be worth it if you think you are in serious danger of losing your job since it will cover your mortgage payments for a time unfortunately the recession has meant that lenders have been making these policies more expensive while reducing the length of cover robert noblewarren of feebased financial adviser murray noble says the cheapest time to take out cover is when you arrange a mortgage typically this adds up to 2 or 3 per cent of your monthly mortgage repayments from a bank or building society but as much as 6 per cent from a broker peter smith of hill martin a feebased adviser specialising in retirement and redundancy planning advises shopping around for cover he also suggests checking the policy to make sure that it is not confined to specific situations for example you might find you have to resign or whether it applies only to those drawing unemployment benefit for which you might be ineligible if you are about to be made redundant consider the following terms of redundancy you might think you have no control over this but smith emphasises that if you are a senior employee your employers desire to get you off his books means you could well find your redundancy conditions are highly negotiable smith says you should refuse to be pressured into signing anything until you have had time to marshal your arguments it is worth consulting a solicitor who specialises in this area particularly if you feel your redundancy was unfair because the construction of the final package will have legal and tax implications redundancy pay only the first pounds 30000 is taxfree if you are sure you have enough income from savings you could consider asking the company to pay amounts over this level into your pension scheme this way you avoid paying tax on them but this can be done only by your employer otherwise if your outlook is uncertain the best way of investing the money is in an instantaccess highinterest bank or building society account if you are married ensure you use up both personal allowances this is not the time to tie up cash in insurance bonds or endowments unless you are sure you have enough income to sustain you until you find another job a feebased financial adviser should give unbiased counsel most independent advisers earn their living through commission on the products they sell you unemployment benefit if you are a redundant professional it might not occur to you to register as unemployed but there are two advantages in doing so you will not have to pay national insurance contributions and could draw unemployment benefit if eligible but it is not worth registering if you are 55 or over since your pension would be offset against benefit smith advises those who think they might be eligible for sickness benefit not to register as unemployed unlike unemployment benefit sickness benefit is not taxable and is transformed into a disability benefit after six months this can also have an earningsrelated supplement pensions do not allow yourself to be sold a personal pension unless you are sure it will be to your advantage warns smith he says you could be substituting final salary certainty for a money purchase hope the alternative is to leave your pension with the company and take it as a deferred pension if you do leave a company scheme which provided you with life cover and permanent health insurance you will need to take these out yourself until you find a new job those who are ill or smokers could find this expensive but smith points out that you might be able to obtain continuation cover from a company scheme in which case you would not need to have a medical this has to be done before leaving the scheme or within a month of it if you have share options you will need to exercise them within a similarly tight time frame mortgages since the tories came to power in 1979 mortgage debt has gone from about 30 per cent of personal disposable income to more than 70 per cent this is the largest monthly commitment for most people and unlike the clothes or food bills can not readily be reduced if you are worried about payments the building societies association advises you to see your lender what it decides will depend on the level of your difficulties the most common solution according to the bsa is to accept lower monthly payments sometimes by as much as 50 per cent but those with endowment mortgages are likely to find these inflexible in such a situation the endowment gives bad value if cashedin early so try not to surrender it if this can be avoided if you are in dire straits your lender might suggest taking a share in the value of the house in exchange for lower monthly payments the disadvantage of course is that you will no longer be entitled to all of any future growth in value in the worst case you might have to consider a mortgagetorent scheme these vary between lenders but a common method is to sell the house to a housing association enabling you to become a tenant and to qualify for housing benefit you could be eligible for income support to cover mortgage interest payments but you must be out of work to qualify usually this would pay half the monthly interest for the first 16 weeks of unemployment and the full amount after that savings and investments in general it is better not to touch longerterm investments such as endowments or fiveyear national savings schemes since your return for early surrender will be low unit trust or investment trust savings plans normally can be stopped without penalty cancel the direct debit and notify the company that you are stopping the scheme temporarily if you can not afford your 25year endowment policy but it has run for more than seven years you might get a better return by selling it to a marketmaker or at auction rather than surrendering it to the insurance company check first with the company how much the surrender value would be and compare this with the auctioneers reserve value if you do not want to encash it but can not afford the premiums your lender might allow you to take a premium holiday otherwise you could consider making the policy paidup in which case you would pay no more and wait for the amount invested already to mature
