president george bush last night ordered 4,500 soldiers and marines to use whatever force is necessary to restore order to the riot-torn city of los angeles in a television broadcast to the nation mr bush condemned the two days of violence that followed the acquittal of four los angeles policemen accused of beating mr rodney king a black motorist there can be no excuse for the murder arson theft or vandalism that have terrorised the people of los angeles the wanton destruction of life and property is not a legitimate protest mr bush's remarks came as the toll of human life property and business continued to rise as many as 38 people almost all black are reported dead and more than 1,000 injured making it the second worst race riot in the us this century after the 47 killed in detroit in 1967 yesterday disturbances spread to several other us cities including las vegas where the national guard has been called out san francisco new york atlanta and seattle none assumed the proportions of what has happened in los angeles although the police in san francisco made some 1,400 arrests in new york last night hundreds of black white and hispanic protesters rampaged through the streets of lower manhattan they broke windows and smashed taxis as riot police attempted to stop them several people were arrested president bush said he had found the videotape of mr king's beating revolting but urged americans to respect the process of law whether or not we agree with the outcome the verdict on wednesday was not the end of the process he said federal action in this case will be expeditious and will be fair it will not be driven by mob violence mr bush's order had the effect of activating 3,000 infantry and 1,500 marines that had been on standby since morning they may now fan out into the streets of los angeles he said he had committed the troops from a staging area near the riot-torn city and 5,200 state national guard forces already on under federal control because incidents of random lawlessness and terror were still going on he said the troops and guards had been placed under a single unified command under the overall supervision of general colin powell the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff mr rodney king whose videotaped beating by police officers set off the rioting yesterday made an emotional appeal for a return to calm i just want to say can we all get along can we stop making it horrible for the older people and the kids we'll get our justice they've won the battle but they haven't won the war he said although the officers who beat mr king were acquitted on criminal charges of assault mr king still has a civil lawsuit pending against them in addition mr william barr the us attorney general said a federal investigation of the possible violation of mr king's civil rights was being aggressively pursued estimates of damage in los angeles were reported by the mayor's office to be as high as dollars 550 m pounds 310 m yesterday sporadic rioting and looting spread to parts of los angeles unaffected on the first night including hollywood and beverly hills and a thick pall of smoke from hundreds of fires still hung over the whole area some of the sharpest confrontations centred on koreatown about two miles west of the downtown area korean shopowners armed themselves with pistols and rifles and shot at bands of looters marauding through the streets in seoul president roh tae-woo called for additional protection for korean natives in los angeles the focus of violence began to change early yesterday from looting to attacks on the police three policemen were shot and a paint factory daubed with anti-police graffiti was set on fire all schools in los angeles were ordered to close again in spite of concerns that young people who might otherwise be at school were roving the streets and adding to the problems mr bush's decision to deploy extra resources was taken after two white house meetings the first of which involved his domestic advisers including gen powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff and the second with black civil rights leaders mr marlin fitzwater the presidential spokesman repeated the president's call for understanding and reason saying anarchy must not prevail the president's approach to what has happened in los angeles is fraught with political risk in this election year on thursday he had expressed a similar understanding for those frustrated by the verdict in the king case and promised an investigation that could lead to a federal prosecution of the acquitted policemen but he later spoke only of the threat to law and order posed by violence and it is now far from clear that a federal prosecution will materialise mr bill clinton his likely democrat opponent in the presidential election has also had to fine-tune some of his comments violence in the us page 3 tough action to quell anarchy across us politicians take common line across race and party divide black leaders demand
