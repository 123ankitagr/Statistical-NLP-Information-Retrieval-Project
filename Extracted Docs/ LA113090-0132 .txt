Janet Evans , Placentia 's triple gold medalist in the 1988 Olympics , said Thursday that she may drop out of Stanford if the NCAA adopts legislation that would force her to decrease her practice time . The NCAA convention in January will consider a proposal that would cut practice time for sports to 20 hours per week during a 24-week season . Another proposal would prohibit college coaches from coaching outside teams during the off-season and from working with their athletes during the off-season . `` It is a significant threat to the success of our athletes at the world level , '' USA Swimming executive director Ray Essick said . `` If you talk to the people from tennis , gymnastics , wrestling , track and field , among others , you 'll hear the same story that you 're hearing from swimming . '' Evans and other swimmers plan to wear special caps during the three-day U.S. Open that begins today . Swimming USA has purchased about 500 caps with a logo that shows a bar passing through the circled words : `` NCAA Restrictions . '' `` As an athlete , we 're really upset about what is being proposed , '' said Evans , a graduate of El Dorado High School who has a 3.0 grade-point average at Stanford despite spending some 30 hours a week training . `` We came to college because we felt we could handle the academic load and swim . If I had n't applied to swim in college , I could have taken the endorsements that were available after 1988 and not bother with studies . `` Personally , I feel we can handle the academic loads . I think for governing bodies ( NCAA ) to be telling us when we can swim , and with whom we can swim is not fair . I think it will put our priority to train for the Olympics and in international competition in jeopardy . It wo n't allow us to train for the Olympics the way we need to train . ''
