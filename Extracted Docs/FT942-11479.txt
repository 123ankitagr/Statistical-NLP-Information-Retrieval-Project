Hafslund Nycomed , the Norwegian group best known for its radiology products , yesterday reported a decline in first-quarter pre-tax profit to NKr302m ( Dollars 40.8m ) from NKr381m in the same period last year , writes Karen Fossli in Oslo . Hafslund blamed the setback on higher depreciation and research and development costs and financial losses . It forecast full-year pre-tax profits in line with last year 's NKr1.57bn . Sales increased by NKr140m to NKr1.68bn helped partly by higher trading activity by Hafslund Energi , the group 's electricity generator .
