Assistant City Manager John F. Shirey is one of seven candidates for the city manager 's job in Cincinnati . City officials there released the names of the finalists last week . Shirey said he has not been officially notified that he is on the finalist list and has not been interviewed . Shirey , the second-highest ranking official in city government , has been assistant city manager for three years . He said Thursday that he is not actively looking for a job but was contacted by a recruiter about the Cincinnati post and decided that he is interested . `` I do n't want you to say that I 'm unhappy and disgruntled and looking to leave , because I 'm not , '' said Shirey , 41 . `` ( Cincinnati is ) a large city with large city problems and large city challenges and a lot like what we find in Long Beach . The difference is I would be the city manager and not No . 2 . '' Shirey said he expects he will go to Ohio for interviews next month . BETTINA BOXALL
