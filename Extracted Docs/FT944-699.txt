in tokyo this december the christmas trees are out in force tinny carols are rattling from loudspeakers and thousands of shops are filled with seasonal merchandise but there is a more than usually hollow ring about the festivities money no longer flows so freely in japan and without it people are starting to wonder what christmas is really about in a country where less than 2 per cent of the population professes any christian belief the celebration was always a copy the japanese took christmas to their hearts not because they wanted to understand what the event was supposed to commemorate what mattered was that americans and europeans were enthusiastic about it this was enough to show that it must have some value and so the japanese set about giving themselves a bigger and incomparably better christmas than the authentic ones in the west in japan better meant more expensive and what developed was the brassiest yuletide in the world traditionalists in the west might bemoan the passing of the true christmas of carols midnight mass and perhaps even spiritual reflection but in japan there never was anything but a commercial tinselled affair the story of the tokyo department store that sold images of a crucified father christmas might be apocryphal but there is little doubt that to most japanese christmas was never more than an ingenious marketing device a new way of persuading the financially incontinent to part with their money the traditional japanese christmas circa 1989 was a dream for the marketing people that focused heavily on the younger generation christmas was sold as the most romantic time of the year and an occasion to cement those special relationships the material way in the bubble years companies were generous with their winter bonuses and a really good christmas eve meant spending around y100000 pounds 645 more than a third of a months salary taking that special someone to a dinner show exchanging presents and spending a night at an upmarket international hotel tokyos tiffany stores were crowded with teenagers and young salarymen in their blue suits shoving people aside to buy trinkets for their girlfriends christmas fever was such that to avoid being left without a hotel reservation for next years christmas eve the meticulous trend manuals even advised men to wake up early the next day to book a room but that was in the time of unbridled confidence about japans economic prospects the days of rapid growth rates and an explosion in wealth the ending of the bubble economy and the four sluggish years through which japans economy has since toiled have made conspicuous consumption irredeemably outmoded among the fashion conscious extravagant spending on christmas eve is now sneered at as baburee or a typical bubble phenomenon the most crushing of putdowns eating at expensive restaurants and hotels wasnt part of my real world says mr nobuhiro hirasawa an office worker who says he spent y45000 last year wining and dining on christmas eve i want to enjoy christmas without spending so much money but there is the nub what to a nation that cant tell a crib from a crucifix is meant by enjoying christmas the materialist credentials are still impeccable one thing the new spirit of christmas means is value for money the hot dog press a fashion weekly for young men has cut its special christmas pages once over 60 at the peak down to 10 telling people to spend lots of money at christmas doesnt necessary sell the magazine any more says mr morihiko katabuchi an editor instead of the y50000 tiffany pendant or the y100000 cartier ring hot dog suggests its readers buy girlfriends a cafe au lait mug for y1400 or a pair of photo frames for y1600 the economic changes have also brought about new tastes among consumers the search for value rather than brand names has given rise to new types of shops discounters superstores and warehousestyle stores selling one category of goods at knockdown prices are becoming mainstream hurting the sales of traditional retailers the department store and the corner stores but the end of the urge to splurge has done more than prompt a search for value it has seen the japanese looking for alternative means of renewal this christmas many are rediscovering their families in the past new years celebrations have been japans main yearend family event with mountains of good luck foods such as rice cakes herring roe and seaweed washed down with sake but in the past few years spending time with family and close friends on christmas eve has become popular since christmas is not a holiday the fall in overtime working hours due to the recession has also helped in getting the family together says ajinomoto the largest food and beverages company that means well it means shopping of course for cheap imported chicken and bargain french sparkling wines so it has become a cheap christmas certainly and maybe even a family christmas but that comes no closer to answering the question why bother in the most material of a materialist world what is a christmas without the money there is no sign of any religious awakening the same small groups of the faithful will turn up at the midnight masses at the christian churches dotted around town some will even take to the streets to hand out food and a few comforting words of the christmas spirit to tokyos growing homeless population but the vast majority of the population will spend the holiday focused even less on its significance than before perhaps they are closer to emulating the west that way than they were in the past one worldweary salaryman provides a hint that perhaps the japanese have after years of trying discovered the real essence of a westernstyle christmas i spent about y30000 on christmas eve last year including y10000 on a bottle of champagne says mr chikara kondo but this year im staying home and watching television
