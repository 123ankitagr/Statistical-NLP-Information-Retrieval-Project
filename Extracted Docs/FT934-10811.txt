after almost 22 years of federation dubai's defence is inextricably bound up not only with that of the united arab emirates but in a wider sense with that of the gulf co-operation council gcc too so defence forces stationed in dubai are referred to by virtue of their geographical location at the centre of the federation as central military command cmc even though direct authority over cmc is via a chain of command containing only names from dubai's ruling family the al maktoum cmc's ground forces consist of as many as 15,000 men out of a total uae federal army of 50,000, according to the london-based international institute for strategic studies up to 80 per cent of cmc is comprised of omanis from the batinah coast in the northern part of the country and the balance from dubai the ground forces include an armoured regiment equipped with italian-made ottomelara tanks of german design with 105 mm guns and british scorpion light-track tanks two infantry brigades and an anti-tank regiment plus artillery the air force includes an air defence regiment and the air wing which has british-made hawk and italian aeromacchi fighter-trainers cmc's titular commander-in-chief is sheikh ahmed bin rashid al maktoum the youngest of the four sons of sheikh rashid dubai's former ruler and brother of sheikh mohammad the uae's minister of defence who was recently promoted to full general by sheikh zayed the uae president and ruler of abu dhabi sheikh mohammad is reported to take a very close interest in cmc as well as exercising financial control the two deputy commanders are sheikh ahmed al maktoum and sheikh butti al maktoum brothers who are close relations of sheikh maktoum dubai's ruler both deputy commanders have passed through britain's officer cadet training college at mons near aldershot of the two sheikh butti is the one most frequently referred to as the day-to-day commander of cmc all of the other senior officers ncos and warrant officers are from dubai although there are egyptian and sudanese training officers plus a few british seconded or on contract the historical role of a dubai army has been to protect dubai itself and given the authority wielded by its ruling family the tradition of retaining command and control is very much alive but today's demands on the uae impose their own realities on cmc to which it has responded during the gulf war cmc would have been in a state of complete readiness it also provided a large squadron some 120 men for a battalion-size force which the uae contributed to the us-led coalition this battalion was engaged at khafji on the saudi-kuwaiti border and took some casualties today cmc has a large squadron as part of the uae force attached to the un forces in somalia although abu dhabi is thought to bear some of the cost of maintaining cmc the overwhelming charge is to dubai's account and this represents a significant part of dubai's direct contribution to the uae federal budget the fact that sheikh mohammad the uae defence minister is from dubai also gives cmc a political dimension like other senior figures in the federation he is reported to be a strong supporter for greater defence co-operation at more levels especially where defence overlaps with political and diplomatic issues
