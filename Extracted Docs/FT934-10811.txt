after almost 22 years of federation dubais defence is inextricably bound up not only with that of the united arab emirates but in a wider sense with that of the gulf cooperation council gcc too so defence forces stationed in dubai are referred to by virtue of their geographical location at the centre of the federation as central military command cmc even though direct authority over cmc is via a chain of command containing only names from dubais ruling family the al maktoum cmcs ground forces consist of as many as 15000 men out of a total uae federal army of 50000 according to the londonbased international institute for strategic studies up to 80 per cent of cmc is comprised of omanis from the batinah coast in the northern part of the country and the balance from dubai the ground forces include an armoured regiment equipped with italianmade ottomelara tanks of german design with 105mm guns and british scorpion lighttrack tanks two infantry brigades and an antitank regiment plus artillery the air force includes an air defence regiment and the air wing which has britishmade hawk and italian aeromacchi fightertrainers cmcs titular commanderinchief is sheikh ahmed bin rashid al maktoum the youngest of the four sons of sheikh rashid dubais former ruler and brother of sheikh mohammad the uaes minister of defence who was recently promoted to full general by sheikh zayed the uae president and ruler of abu dhabi sheikh mohammad is reported to take a very close interest in cmc as well as exercising financial control the two deputy commanders are sheikh ahmed al maktoum and sheikh butti al maktoum brothers who are close relations of sheikh maktoum dubais ruler both deputy commanders have passed through britains officer cadet training college at mons near aldershot of the two sheikh butti is the one most frequently referred to as the daytoday commander of cmc all of the other senior officers ncos and warrant officers are from dubai although there are egyptian and sudanese training officers plus a few british seconded or on contract the historical role of a dubai army has been to protect dubai itself and given the authority wielded by its ruling family the tradition of retaining command and control is very much alive but todays demands on the uae impose their own realities on cmc to which it has responded during the gulf war cmc would have been in a state of complete readiness it also provided a large squadron some 120 men for a battalionsize force which the uae contributed to the usled coalition this battalion was engaged at khafji on the saudikuwaiti border and took some casualties today cmc has a large squadron as part of the uae force attached to the un forces in somalia although abu dhabi is thought to bear some of the cost of maintaining cmc the overwhelming charge is to dubais account and this represents a significant part of dubais direct contribution to the uae federal budget the fact that sheikh mohammad the uae defence minister is from dubai also gives cmc a political dimension like other senior figures in the federation he is reported to be a strong supporter for greater defence cooperation at more levels especially where defence overlaps with political and diplomatic issues
