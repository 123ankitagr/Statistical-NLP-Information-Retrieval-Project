Sunday 's National Football League game between the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots will be played at Stanford Stadium in nearby Palo Alto , while preparation continues to ready Candlestick Park for the resumption of the World Series next Tuesday . `` Stanford and 49er officials met earlier today and arrived at that decision , '' David Brown of the Stanford sports information office said Thursday . A spokeswoman in the 49ers ' ticket office at Candlestick Park confirmed the change . The decision to use Stanford was made after team officials toured Candlestick Park on Thursday morning , two days after the devastating Bay Area earthquake , and rejected that arena as the venue for the game . Brown said that a limited number of $ 25 tickets went on sale at Stanford on Thursday , with proceeds going to the Bay Area earthquake relief fund . Stanford Stadium has a capacity of 86,000 , compared to Candlestick Park 's 65,701 seats . Brown said that the game will be televised on NBC as scheduled . At least one 49er player was happy with the decision . `` I 've never played on it , but I 've practiced on it and it 's a real fast field , '' wide receiver Jerry Rice said . `` As long as we stay home it 's fine with me . '' It will be only the second home game of the season for the 49ers , who are 5-0 on the road and lost their only home game , 13-12 , to the Rams . Engineers inspected Stanford Stadium , located about 35 miles south of San Francisco , and found no structural damage . `` We 're pleased with how well it rode it out , '' athletic director Andy Geiger said . The 49ers had Tuesday off , but Coach George Seifert said the building at their training headquarters in Santa Clara `` rocked and rolled '' during the 6.9 earthquake . There were hairline cracks in the building 's stucco , and a large picture and 10 game balls on display in the main entrance fell to the floor .
