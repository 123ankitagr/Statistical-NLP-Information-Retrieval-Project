sir i read with interest your recent report about motorway toll plans in great britain tories attack motorway toll plans august 13 because the questions raised have global relevance let me add a few observations about the longterm trends as we can observe them over the world first the total level of road user charging taxes plus tolls will go on rising for decades to come whatever we do because all financial administrations are increasingly resorting to road user charges as an easy way to boost resources and help plug the yawning gap in public accounts for instance in 1992 total income from road traffic in the 18 most developed countries in europe was approximately pounds 150bn whereas total road expenditure construction maintenance operation was about pounds 50bn thus pounds 100bn was diverted to other purposes the rate of diversion has been continuously rising for the past 12 years second the only question open now is what proportion of the total charge may flow back to road users in terms of road improvement network extension causeway widening elimination of safety black spots environmental protection hightech services third the best way to make sure that road users money goes back to road users is to privatise road operations ie concede toll traffic and maintenance management to autonomous competing enterprises fourth this privatisation thanks to the generalisation of automatic tolling devices can and probably must progressively apply to existing road and street facilities as well as to new ones thus the traffic flight issue which by the way rarely goes beyond a 1015 per cent shift of traffic at most during the first four or six months after commissioning a toll motorway would disappear in due time axel sinding international road federation ch1202 geneva switzerland
