People in the media are in the business of selling illusion ; but , increasingly , they are beginning to believe the illusions themselves . Such was the case when Daniel Cerone asked television critics `` What America Watches -- and Why '' ( Aug. 6 ) . To believe that TV critics are authorities on what motivates viewers to watch one program over another is to put up mirrors and smoke screens . What is more interesting is how such critics themselves influence what America watches . Indeed , TV critics create self-fulfilling prophecies by telling the public what they are going to like or dislike and why . CAROLE LIEBERMAN , MD Malibu
