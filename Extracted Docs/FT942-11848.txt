a fax bureau says that mercury the uk's second-largest telecommunications carrier overcharged it by up to pounds 100,000 in 12 months by transmitting its faxes too slowly the bureau is preparing a formal complaint to oftel the industry watchdog comwave the uk subsidiary of swiss-based company comwave communications said network providers do not have to comply with regulatory standards while manufacturers equipment must pass stringent standards before it can be connected to the network oftel agreed this week that public telecommunications operators were not obliged to guarantee that fax calls would be successful or completed at any particular speed comwave said that faxes sent on mercury lines took an average of 18 per cent more time than faxes on british telecommunications lines it warned that other companies using mercury could unwittingly be paying too much for fax transmission comwave has switched to another network operator for its fax business it claims to be the first company in the uk to have established a global fax broadcast service the service is used by customers such as mcgraw hill the us publisher swiss bank and british alcan to distribute time-critical information last year comwave noticed that faxes sent on some of its 50 mercury lines were taking longer than they should the cause of the problem which mercury does not deny was a mismatch between comwave's fax machines and a piece of mercury equipment which essentially persuaded the machine that it was transmitting over a poor-quality line and dropped the transmission speed accordingly mercury while not admitting liability has agreed to credit comwave with pounds 20,000
