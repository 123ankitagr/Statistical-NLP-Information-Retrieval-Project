Traffic across the Firth of Forth is likely to grow by 50 per cent between 1990 and 2010 , says an independent study into plans for a privately financed second Forth road bridge . The report for the Scottish Office said that neither a new bridge nor public transport improvements in isolation would resolve the problems of increased traffic which could lead to regular 10-mile tailbacks . The study was carried out by MVA Consultancy , Oscar Faber TPA and Environmental Resource Management .
