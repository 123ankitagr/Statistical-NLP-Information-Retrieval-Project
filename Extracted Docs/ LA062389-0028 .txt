Two days after she was formally rebuffed by Gov . George Deukmejian , Mayor Maureen O'Connor wrote a reply Thursday , asking for a meeting . The governor told the mayor Tuesday that he would not consider her request for a one-time grant of $ 34 million to help the city through what O'Connor and the City Council have labeled a `` state of emergency '' caused by drug- and gang-related violence . The mayor had wanted Deukmejian to declare a similar state of emergency in order to release the funds from a new-found state budget surplus . In her letter to the governor , O'Connor said : `` While you are justifiably proud of your law enforcement record with respect to San Diego , the fact is that we are still losing the war to the criminal element . `` I would argue that San Diego is using all available resources to combat the problem 'wisely and efficiently to protect the public safety ' ( the governor 's words ) and is daily losing ground . '' The mayor said she had discussed the situation with federal officials , and that they , state officials and local representatives must work together to remedy the problem . `` I would like to show you San Diego 's problem but , if your schedule does not allow a visit here , I am more than willing to meet you at the time and place of your choosing , '' the mayor said .
