docklands is both a very old community and a very new one some of the people who live there have roots in the area which extend back for generations others have been there only months or years but together they have a common interest in ensuring that one of europe's largest development projects is a success for some people the priority has been the completion and operation of vital elements of the area's commercial infrastructure others have been concerned to ensure that the all-important social aspects of a developing riverside community attract equal attention most at least agree that docklands is beyond the point where division and disagreement are useful despite inevitable continuing friction the emphasis is on working together as much as possible for the benefit of the entire community we all fought with the development corporation but if you can't beat them join them says rita bensley a lifelong docklands resident and prime mover in the docklands business initiative it was formed last year principally to lobby government for a go-ahead to the jubilee line underground extension mrs bensley despite other community commitments jumped in to help though she held many doubts about the way the area was being developed she believes the underground extension is vital for dockland's future she helped organise a petition for the extension among the local community which raised 2,500 signatures on the first day and then accompanied it to downing street the government she says has to show its support for the east end of london and docklands in particular which many people think has closed down mrs bensley is also chairwoman of the association of island communities a docklands umbrella group which has been fighting for local people for more than 50 years she is administrator at a local community centre and also helps out at an old people's club room the jubilee line will bring in more employment some of it for local people if it goes ahead it will be wonderful news the people of docklands have been forced to live on a building site for ten years we've had the coffee now its time for the cream another high-profile activist is pat ward a former barclays bank man who came to docklands in the mid-1980s to establish his bank's presence in the area made redundant he joined the isle of dogs community trust becoming its director in 1991 the trust which was set up in 1989, raises funds from the business community and distributes them within the local community it has to date given about pounds 200,000 to a variety of organisations bids for grants of up to pounds 1,000 are considered and the trust also has other funds to help larger self-help projects mr ward says we are helping to create permanent links between local business and community which are of benefit to everyone les webber is chairman of the docklands business club which was started in 1984 by dockland's early settlers when wellington boots were still the order of the day mr webber the club's third chairman says it has suffered in the last 18 months given the recession and lack of confidence in docklands but membership has again started to rise with around 450 names now on the corporate register they include ogilvy mather bt tate lyle and recent newcomers texaco a prime role for the club apart from lobbying everyone and everything from ministers to commons select committees on behalf of the business community is to encourage networking between local companies he believes the club's future is now secure mr webber is also well-known locally as an executive of builder group the trade press publishers which has itself invested pounds 8 m in docklands premises i believe in banging the drum for docklands unless people already here get off their backsides and shout about the attractions then our own investment in the area is being eroded he says one of the single biggest investments in docklands is london city airport perched on the royal docks and run by william charnock managing director mr charnock arrived in early 1988, the year after the airport opened for business the controversy surrounding the airport was still in full swing and as the complex has expanded its impact on the local community has been the raw material of local newspaper headlines mr charnock charts the enormous changes at the airport which have taken place since his arrival and is confident that despite the turbulence surrounding its expansion its future is now looking brighter speed of access to the airport despite its proximity to the city has been unreliable because of the weak transport links and the slim choice of destinations has inevitably restricted its popularity no big airline operators have come in and as yet there are no domestic onward links but several new services are to be introduced in the coming months and there will be faster access from the city following the opening of the new docklands highway from the city and on to your aircraft in 30 minutes we are compact quick and friendly he claims last year the airport handled 187,000 passengers and he hopes 1993 will see up to 300,000 people passing through the airport however is still loss-making a position which is unlikely to change until between 450,000 and 500,000 opt for london city capacity is two million a year mr charnock who has a staff of 90 around 450 people in all work around the airport complex is optimistic the year has started very well the airlines appear increasingly confident and things are looking up construction group mowlem has not however yet managed to find a partner to share its load someone who has been involved in the development of docklands a great deal longer is peter turlik head of strategic affairs at the london docklands development corporation a town-planner by profession he was involved in docklands before the lddc was born firstly via secondment to the greater london council's docklands joint committee and then to the department of the environment he joined the lddc on its formation in 1981 as director of industrial development with responsibility for vesting in the corporation local land and for setting up the docklands enterprise zone that first christmas there were 12 of us in the old fred olsen shipping building and we kept getting lost every time we tried to get off the isle of dogs through the old timber yards mr turlik later became director of business development and by 1988 was overseeing efforts to attract overseas investment as head of strategic affairs he oversees the lddc corporate plan which is submitted annually to the doe he thinks the corporation has used the last two difficult years well to retrench and prepare for the next phase of expansion i sometimes have to pinch myself things have gone tremendously quickly we had a lot of luck in the 1980 s and we've also had our bad breaks but we don't give ourselves enough credit for what has been achieved docklands is a new experience however for roger colomb a managing director of texaco the energy group which moved into canary wharf only weeks ago as the man in charge of administration he has been responsible for relocating 1,000 staff the last arrivals moving in to westferry circus at the beginning of march mr colomb may be a new face and texaco may be a new name locally but he is keen to make his company an integral part of the local community as soon as possible he says texaco has an opportunity to play an important role in the life of docklands financially as well as socially and intends to do so the company with a 1,000 year lease on 230,000 sq ft of office space has already forged links with local organisations mr colomb says there is a real opportunity for us to put down some real roots but his own daily journey from buckinghamshire takes him only ten minutes longer than to knightsbridge so he does not intend to move in to live eric sorensen might be forgiven for thinking he has been chief executive of the lddc for ten years rather than just over two years he arrived from the department of the environment as docklands faced its biggest crisis and readily admits that the going has been extremely tough the recession the collapse of canary wharf uncertainty over the jubilee line and the doe's own decision not to relocate here gave the impression that the government had become bored with the whole process it was not the case but that's how it appeared mr sorensen 48, was at the doe from 1967 until he arrived at the doe and has wide experience of urban regeneration he was private secretary to mr peter shore when he was environment secretary and spent three years as head of the merseyside task force developing local regeneration projects by 1987 he was head of the urban policy unit in the cabinet office and became deputy secretary of the doe's housing and construction command before joining the lddc last year was he says the low point but he is optimistic that docklands will soon be back on course there is also a new spring in the step of malcolm hutchinson managing director of the docklands light railway after a rough start which made it something of a local laughing stock the dlr is regaining its reputation as a modern fast passenger service linking docklands and the city with brown root the us engineering contractors appointed to manage the system's expansion over the next three years mr hutchinson says i am a great fan of docklands i am confident it has a bright future and i am determined with the help of my staff to play a full part in the area's regeneration
