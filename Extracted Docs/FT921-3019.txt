shostakovich's fourth symphony op 43 is one of his biggest and most brazen the modernist excursion of 1936 which he did not dare have performed once stalin had condemned the 1932 opera lady macbeth of mtsensk for formalism and which was succeeded by the soviet artist's practical creative reply to just criticism in the form of the world-beating fifth symphony it was not until 1961 that it was deemed safe in the ussr to give the fourth its premiere and experiencing the cataclysmic climaxes grinding dissonances and moments of pure weirdness in jeffrey tate's splendid account of the work with the london symphony orchestra on sunday night one could hear why it is a huge structure a central quasi-scherzo flanked by movements lasting each some 25 minutes scored for a huge orchestra and dealing in bold ideas as if anticipating penderecki's early manner shostakovich creates a dialectic of sheer sonority the presto fugal passage for the strings in the first movement generates a sonorous energy that goes far beyond the needs of any conventional thematic argument or it did in the lso's rendering at any rate likewise the thick chorus of woodwinds early in the second movement began to conjure up the music of ligeti while the outbreak of dry ironic percussion dominated by unlikely castanets with which the movement comes to its sudden stop evoked for all the world the later loopier tippett tate well brought out this movement's strange quality of tragic insouciance and elsewhere variously the bitter-sweet naughtiness of fugues and waltzes the painful stridency the note of desolation and all the characteristic expressive elements which no criticism ever compelled shostakovich to alter the climaxes were admirably judged even if the last of them taxed the barbican's acoustics admirable too were the numerous solos for instruments or sections ian bousfield's trombone martin gatt's bassoon the piccolo section the two frenetic timpanists the celesta-player who inscrutably signs the work off gatt and three of his fellow principals composed the solo quartet in mozart's sinfonia concertante in e flat k 297 b for oboe roy carter clarinet andrew marriner horn hugh seenan and bassoon which filled the first half a work of doubtful authenticity it rarely fails to make a tedious impression but the stylish virtuosity of these players did much to sustain interest
