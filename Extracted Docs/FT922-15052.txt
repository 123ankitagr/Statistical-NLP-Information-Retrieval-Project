Sir , The suggestion that commercial users would benefit from road pricing is both misleading and naive ( 'Commercial users seen to gain from road pricing ' , April 1 ) . Road pricing would reduce their business in urban areas . In Sweden , the local council in Stockholm has estimated that road pricing would reduce retail trade by 8 per cent . Clearly , such a reduction in economic activity would soon erode any operational benefits that might accrue to commercial users . While road pricing may offer a conveniently simplistic solution to urban congestion , the practical realities of its introduction are more complex and disturbing . During the 1980s , 80 per cent of the growth in retail floor space took place in out-of-town sites . Pricing urban roads and discouraging their use will only create greater pressure for the development of green field sites where access is cheaper . Road pricing is socially divisive and inequitable . The wealthy will be able to afford personal mobility , the poor will not . Despite improvement to public transport many will still aspire to be car owners . The majority of people will find road pricing as popular as the poll tax . Paul Everitt , assistant director , British Road Federation , Pillar House , 194-202 Old Kent Road , London SE1 5TG
