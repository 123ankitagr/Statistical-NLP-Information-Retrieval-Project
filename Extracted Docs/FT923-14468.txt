dubai wants to be everywhere else in the world at once it would like its ports to be the singapore of the middle east and its air-cargo terminal the seattle of the middle east it wants to become a miami-style cruise centre for the middle east and it wants its golf courses to make the emirate the wentworth of the middle east there are plans to make it the epsom of the middle east with a new horse-racing track and those are just a few of its ambitions leaving aside for a moment plans to build its own gulfodisney-type theme park about the only places in the world dubai apparently does not want to resemble are riyadh for example or abu dhabi its big-brother emirate down the coast when dubai's promoters who are ubiquitous talk of this magpie city-state being cosmopolitan what they mean is that dubai is not a particularly typical gulf or even arab city even its indigenous locals apparently feel much the same way i love it when people say dubai is like san diego says mr mohammed al-abbar the new head of the city's economics department in his impeccable us accent he is just back from six years in singapore one obvious reason why dubai does not have a specially arab feel is because local arabs make up a only small proportion of the city's estimated 600,000 inhabitants perhaps only a fifth indians iranians pakistanis filipinos sri lankans and a large helping of americans britons and other europeans make up the rest and it was ever thus wilfred thesiger the british explorer arrived in dubai circa 1948 to find the soukhs crowded with pallid arab townsmen armed bedu quick-eyed and imperious negro slaves baluchis persians and indians among them i noticed a group of kashgai tribesmen in their distinctive felt caps and some somalis off a sambuk from aden dubai's promiscuous port has attracted buyers and sellers from everywhere since it was settled by the maktoum family who seceded from abu dhabi in 1833 the maktoums have traditionally barred few from entering dubai who might add to its wealth today as a result quick-eyed armed bedu are thin on the ground there are a couple slung with worn wooden carbines guarding the british bank of the middle east one of dubai's founding colonial institutions but these days they are allowed only one symbolic bullet between them thesiger would also recognise little of the town itself in his heyday a sparsely-settled gulfside village with a fort now the city's museum and few big buildings among the settlers palm-frond houses although dubai's first concrete house was not built until 1956, the advent of oil and the development ambitions of sheikh rashid bin saeed bin maktoum the emirate's second ruler who died in 1990, quickly turned dubai into a sprawling low-rise city which today is crossed by multi-lane highways roaring with traffic and which is studded with prestige modern hotels and occasional high-rises you can spot the desert from some of these but you would need a car to find a camel its plethora of soukhs shopping streets and cavernous marbled malls burst with cloth clothes watches enough for the wrists of a small continent cameras tvs walkmans and almost anything else at knock-down prices which brave and persistent souls can try knocking down further if there is a shopping equivalent of stendhal's syndrome a condition identified in florence of dizziness brought on by excessive exposure to great works of art its first victims will fall palpitating in dubai just as dizzying is dubai's kaleidoscope of cultures by wanting to be everywhere at once the city ends up not really knowing what it is the streets of satwa with their curry houses tiny tailor shops and mirror-tiled barbers might be the suburb of an indian city the chicago beach village just out of town could be a corner of marbella its satellite shopping malls perhaps calgary or edmonton it may reflect dubai's cultural indecision that the city has roundabouts with traffic lights its interiors can be equally bemusing sit in one of the hotels de rigueur english-style pubs and you will likely be served by a filipino in full oriental dress against a backdrop wallposter view of the eiffel tower probably while enjoying caribbean night music the new and elite aviation club is resplendent with roman pillars pagodas and english lawns all done with an austere swedish finish as a rule of thumb what is not arabesque in dubai is pastiche and everything preferably is brand new but dubai specialises in its incongruities no sight in the gulf is more arresting for example than the emirates golf club an undulating 18-hole oasis in the greened sands east of the city which earlier this year seve ballesteiros conquered to win the first round of the pga circuit the creek golf club nearing completion in the city's south with its sharpened sydney opera house clubhouse and a yacht marina to follow is a similarly defiant sight these golf clubs and dubai's beach resorts innumerable sports clubs and other grand facilities are not folies de richesse even at a cost of dhs8 per gallon of water to green the fairways rather they are part of a concerted and extremely high-energy campaign to champion dubai as the gulf's most attractive centre for foreign investment and without more foreign investment the emirate's opulence will not survive the drying of its oil wells at present rates due some time early next century behind this lies the determination of dubai's government that is sheikh maktoum bin rashid the ruler and his brothers to do all in its power to make the city-state an atypically easy place to do business by gulf standards flowing from this desire are the development of the jebel ali free trade zone outside the city where foreign companies can enjoy 100 per cent ownership the creation and aggressive marketing of emirates airlines the sponsorship of world-class sporting events and the selling of dubai as a tourist resort the golf courses and a generally hands-off approach to government about the only thing preventing the government from turning dubai into a full-blown hong kong is the emirate's place within the seven-city state united arab emirates uae which is dominated by the far more conservatively gulf arab and far more oil wealthy abu dhabi they're more capitalist here than thatcher is how one expatriate businessman puts it the only reason they don't deregulate things more is because of the uae and the gulf co-operation council which groups the six main arabian peninsular states they don't want to upset people instead and in keeping with an abiding rivalry with its bigger neighbour dubai seeks to distinguish itself by the audacity of its ambition after the golf courses will come a horse-racing track which will host an international meet dubai will host a round of the world's power boat championships then build a theme park then perhaps run its own cruise liners maybe build a new cricket pitch which some people are already suggesting might vie for the cricket world cup perhaps it will even install a monorail linking all dubai's hotels to the theme park one rumour even has it that dubai is considering creating a ski-slope on the mountains to its west with real snow presumably the idea is to turn dubai into the gstaad of the middle east
