Over the objections of Midway City residents , Westminster received first rights to annex that unincorporated area . The Local Agency Formation Commission voted to place Midway City , four small islands of territory near Beach Boulevard and Bolsa Avenue , in Westminster 's area for planning purposes . `` The people of Midway City do not want to be in the sphere of influence of Westminster , '' said Art Horne , president of the Midway City Chamber of Commerce and Homeowners Assn . `` We do n't need Westminster in Midway City . '' Westminster has no plans to annex Midway City , City Councilwoman Joy L. Neugebauer said . But because the area probably will be annexed someday , having first rights to annexation will help Westminster take the area into account when making long-range city plans . Residents oppose joining Westminster because the city charges its residents a 5 % utility tax , Horne said . Also , past attempts by Westminster to annex tiny pieces of Midway City have created ill feelings , he said . County Supervisor Don R. Roth , a member of the commission , voted against the majority . Midway City one day will be annexed by Westminster , Roth said . But the commission should not force the issue while most Midway City residents strongly oppose it , he said . TOM MCQUEENEY
