BMW Rolls-Royce , the Anglo-German aero-engine joint venture , has been talking to the Taiwanese government about possible involvement by the Asian country in future developments of its BR710 series of medium-thrust engines . Taipei said yesterday that Sir Ralph Robins , chairman of Rolls-Royce , met Mr Lien Chan , prime minister , on Monday to discuss the possibility of Taiwanese participation in the project . Taiwanese aerospace officials said discussions were still in a very early stage , with the form and size of any investment unclear . In London , Rolls-Royce said Sir Ralph was in Taipei on behalf of BMW Rolls-Royce . The discussions were one of a number that the joint venture company is having with companies about future developments of the engine . A venture with BMW Rolls-Royce could represent the second significant step in Taiwan 's drive to develop its fledgling aerospace industry . In January , Taiwan Aerospace , which is 29 per cent owned by the government , agreed to form a venture with British Aerospace to make regional passenger jets to be assembled in the UK and Taiwan . A proposal for Taiwan Aerospace to invest Dollars 2bn for a 49 per cent stake in McDonnell Douglas 's civil aircraft business fell through last year . The joint venture between BMW and Rolls-Royce , announced in May 1990 , is a big step towards strengthening the European aero-engine industry . The venture is developing the BR710 family of engines - designed for business and regional jets - at a plant outside Berlin . Since September it has won orders from Gulfstream of the US and the Canadian Bombardier group .
