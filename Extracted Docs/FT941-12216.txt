a series of scandals has robbed costa rica's leading presidential candidate of his commanding lead in the opinion polls as one of the dirtiest election campaigns in the central american country's history draws to a close mr jose mara figueres of the opposition national liberation party is now even with or slightly behind his opponent mr miguel angel rodrguez of the ruling social christian unity party in the election on sunday according to most polls the constitution prohibits president rafael angel calderon from running for re-election mr figueres son of a popular former president mr jose pepe figueres was in front by at least seven percentage points in the autumn but his fortunes have tumbled through scandals and accusations including allegations that he was involved in the murder of a drug dealer 20 years ago given the popularity of his father this was to be an election for mr figueres to win easily but an unpleasant court battle got his campaign off to a poor start in october mr figueres sued for libel and slander two authors the brothers david and jose romero whose best-selling 1991 book the chemise case linked him with the unsolved murder of a suspected drug dealer in dramatic testimony mr figueres denied the killing but a costa rican judge in a ruling on november 30, upheld a previous judgement absolving the authors mr figueres whose father was president at the time of the killing had vowed to resign if he lost the case now though he is pressing on and has even claimed victory after one of the romeros witnesses was adjudged to have slandered him during a television interview i'm not going to retire or take a single step back this is won and won cleanly said mr figueres mr rodrguez has capitalised on the upset and has attacked his rival over complaints that a leading television journalist was fired after pressure from the figueres campaign team mr rodrguez's campaign advertising called mr figueres a threat to the freedom of the press the latter was also implicated last month in a mining investment scandal of the early-1980s the public prosecutor's office ruled last week that mr figueres was involved in the scandal but could not be charged because of the statute of limitations in response the figueres team has claimed that mr rodrguez had a role in the shipping of tainted beef to the us in the 1980 s when he ran a beef export company the mud-slinging has done little to indicate where the candidates would take the country over the next four years the two leading parties claim to be radically different but they tend to contest the middle ground both candidates say they would continue a 10-year programme of reduced government spending and privatisation and would continue to integrate the economy with its central american neighbours five nations of the region signed a landmark pact this year to create a free-trade bloc but costa rica reserved the right to collect its own customs duties and to prevent free movement of labour the national liberation party tends to be more concerned with maintaining social programmes while the social christian unity party favours free market economic reforms a simpler view of costa rican politics suggests that mr figueres will win because it is his party's turn the two parties have exchanged power at every election but one since 1948 costa rica still has the richest and most stable economy in the region and elections tend to be free of fraud and violence even so the nation is facing new economic and social tensions foreign debt of more than dollars 4 bn represents 62 per cent of annual gross domestic product of dollars 6.5 bn recent administrations have reduced the debt through a brady plan restructuring cutting government spending and introducing austerity measures but wages have not kept pace with inflation and taxes even though annual inflation has been cut to 9 per cent over the past 12 months costa rica's traditional exports have also suffered bananas from uncertainty about exports to the european union and coffee from falling world prices which led the country with other coffee producers to withhold 20 per cent of output from october 1 together with rising imports this produced a trade deficit of dollars 833 m last year nearly three times that of 1989 costa rica has endured international criticism over its labour and human rights records in a report in october the us labour group the afl-cio said unions in costa rica were not legally protected mr calderon's government was embarrassed and outraged but worried by the prospect of us sanctions it approved in november labour reforms that appeased the us group this criticism with a recent report from amnesty international accusing costa rica of human rights violations have been embarrassments for costa ricans who consider themselves above such charges for all that costa rica has lots to brag about as the candidates daily remind voters a growing tourism industry has offset faltering commodity sales making it the main source of revenue some dollars 505 m was earned from 700,000 ecotourists this year twice as many as in 1989 growth has remained robust 6.5 per cent last year compared with 7.8 per cent in 1992
