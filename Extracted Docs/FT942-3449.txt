the german central bank will continue to rely on money supply as a key guide to its monetary policy but extra time may be needed to iron out recent distortions mr hans tietmeyer bundesbank president hinted last night the bank stood by the principle of its policy based on the m3 measure of monetary growth he said this did not exclude consideration of the special factors affecting m3 or fine-tuning including the time horizon the issues would be discussed at the bank's mid-year m3 review next month he said at an international banking gathering in frankfurt mr tietmeyer's comments suggest the bank is seeking to damp widespread criticism that m3 has been discredited that the bank's own credibility has suffered as a result and that the measure should be abandoned a recent study from goldman sachs for example attributed recent weakness in bond markets partly to the bundesbank's ambivalent attitude towards m3 growth rates which this year have far exceeded its target range of 4-6 per cent in april the measure was still growing at 15.4 per cent the bank had sharply reduced interest rates despite months of excessive monetary growth while at the same time continuing to stress the inflationary dangers of growing liquidity the study said keeping the current target range unchanged until the end of 1995 was the only theoretically clean and credible solution to the bank's dilemma the government's council of economic experts the so-called five wise men has often suggested that the current practice of setting targets for one year at a time should be dropped extension of the 1994 target's time-scale would allow more time for the absorption into long-term investments of excess liquidity currently distorting the m3 data and avoid the danger of a new 1995 target being disrupted from the outset although the 1995 m3 target is not due to be set until next december the central bank may now feel that markets need more reassurance than has been available so far until now central bank officials have tended simply to insist that m3 must stay mr tietmeyer again stressed that money supply targeting remained a key indicator in bundesbank policy alternative strategies practised elsewhere in countries which had given up targeting had yet to stand the test of time he added while admitting the bank could not calculate the precise effects of the special factors distorting m3 at present it was by no means in a state which others had experienced in the past where it could no longer make any sense of money supply growth he added he was concerned that recent disruptions starting back in 1990 with german unification seemed to have affected m3's capacity as an effective indicator but internal and external research had yet to suggest that the long-term relationship between money supply and inflation had been altered monetary targeting constituted a part of germany's stability culture which would not be easy to give up he said
