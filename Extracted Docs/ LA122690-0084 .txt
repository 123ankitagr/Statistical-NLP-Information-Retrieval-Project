City planners recently approved a $ 2-million proposal for improving the Interstate 5 interchange at Camino de Estrella . Heavy traffic congestion along San Clemente 's northernmost thoroughfare , which is known as Camino de los Mares east of the freeway , has forced traffic engineers to propose widening the road by 100 feet and installing eight new , synchronized traffic signals . Also being proposed is the widening of the southbound freeway off-ramp to Camino de Estrella in order to provide a left-turn lane . If the project is approved by the City Council , the changes are expected to be under way by spring 1991 , according to traffic engineer Akram Hindeyeh . WENDY PAULSON
