Qintex Entertainment Inc. , whose Australian affiliate 's deal to buy MGM/UA Communications Co. collapsed nearly two weeks ago amid financing problems , has filed for bankruptcy law protection after it failed to make a debt payment , the company announced Friday . In addition , David Evans resigned as president , chief executive and a director , but he will remain as a consultant until a successor is appointed , Qintex said . The bankruptcy filing raises new questions about just how cash-strapped is Qintex Australia , the Brisbane-based broadcasting and resorts empire founded by investor Christopher C. Skase . That company owns 43 % of Qintex Entertainment . The Beverly Hills-based television production firm , best known for co-producing the hit `` Lonesome Dove '' miniseries , filed late Thursday for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code . Under Chapter 11 , a company continues operating while it works out a plan to pay its debts . Qintex 's two subsidiaries , Hal Roach Studios and Qintex Productions , were included in the bankruptcy filing . In over-the-counter trading Friday , Qintex stock plunged $ 2.63 a share to close at $ 1.50 , with more than 1.43 million shares changing hands . Qintex Entertainment filed for bankruptcy because it and Qintex Australia were unable to arrange financing to pay $ 5.95 million due to MCA Inc. as part of a distribution agreement , said Qintex Entertainment Executive Vice President Jonathan Lloyd . The company relies primarily on Qintex Australia to provide working capital . `` It was a grave disappointment that they were unable or unwilling to fund that obligation , '' Lloyd said . Qintex Entertainment officials feared that failure to make the MCA payment might trigger acceleration clauses in its other debt , he said . `` This company . . . has grown at a very rapid rate . That kind of growth in a production company requires a lot of capital and deficit financing , '' Lloyd said . `` It was always understood ( that Qintex Australia ) . . . would be there to fund the growth of the company . '' Evans , an Australian who was closely associated with Qintex Australia , resigned for `` personal reasons , '' he said . A Qintex Australia spokesman said the company had `` re-evaluated its position as a significant shareholder and substantial creditor '' of the U.S. company and decided to `` minimize the degree of further loans '' to the affiliate . Qintex Australia is not having financial problems , the spokesman said . `` Nothing should be read into this concerning the viability of Qintex Australia . This is Qintex Entertainment , '' he said . Qintex Entertainment maintained that the bankruptcy filing was unrelated to Qintex Australia 's shredded deal with MGM/UA . The $ 1.5-billion sale of MGM/UA fell apart Oct. 10 after Qintex Australia failed to deliver a $ 50-million letter of credit . MGM/UA responded by filing suit against Qintex Australia alleging breach of contract , fraud and negligent misrepresentation that resulted in damages of more than $ 50 million . Lloyd said Qintex currently has enough cash on hand to pay its bills . `` We do think the business is viable , '' he said . For the nine months ended April 30 , Qintex Entertainment reported operating revenue of $ 76.8 million and income before an extraordinary credit of $ 2.3 million . Qintex reported losses in the previous two fiscal years . On April 30 , the company had assets of $ 220 million and net worth of $ 63 million . `` Management did n't make the decision lightly , '' Lloyd said . `` We feel very distressed about the effect on the stock price and our shareholders .
