COLES MYER , Australia 's biggest retailer , is considering publicly floating Progressive Enterprises , its New Zealand subsidiary . Mr Brian Quinn , chief executive , said yesterday the company had retained C. S. First Boston as adviser for the sell-off , but Coles planned to remain the largest shareholder in Progressive . Coles acquired Progressive in 1988 , and foreshadowed a public flotation at that time . The New Zealand company operates 58 supermarkets and controls about 30 per cent of that market segment in New Zealand 's north island .
