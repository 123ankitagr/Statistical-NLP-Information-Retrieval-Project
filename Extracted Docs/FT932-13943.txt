Three Branch Davidian cult survivors of the fire which destroyed their compound in Waco , Texas , are led away under arrest yesterday . US president Bill Clinton said he did not intend to ask attorney general Janet Reno to resign over the disastrous ending to the 51-day siege . He said he accepted full responsibility for the events which culminated in the deaths of about 80 members of the religious cult when the FBI advanced on their stronghold . Report , Page 6
