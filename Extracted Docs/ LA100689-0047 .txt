If the music itself had been as good as the performances , it might have been a memorable evening . As it was , the Viklarbo Chamber Ensemble picked only half of an interesting program for its season-opening concert at Loyola Marymount 's Murphy Hall . The first half of the concert was dedicated to music rarely heard outside of colleges and universities . Music by Gordon Jacob and Robert Muczynski hardly makes the blood boil . The second half , however , did a lot to make up for it . Thank Zoltan Kodaly for that . Viklarbo 's choice of music Wednesday night may have been less than inspiring , but its technical accomplishment was not . Now in its third season , the ensemble has established solid musical values and gave intense and committed performances throughout the evening . Kodaly 's Duo for violin and cello , Opus 7 , was the high point of the concert . Written shortly after he began his systematic collecting of Hungarian folk song , the Duo is unceasingly lyrical , and colorfully and imaginatively scored . Above all , it is an engaging dialogue of song , in which the two performers trade material back and forth constantly . Violinist Maria Newman and cellist Sebastian Toettcher gave it a soulful , aggressive and driven performance . Clarinetist Jeff Elmassian and pianist Wendy Prober joined Newman ( now on viola ) for British composer Jacob 's Trio ( 1969 ) . The piece has some English-tinged folk melody in it , lots of innocuous contrapuntalism , some pleasant textures , and is eminently forgettable . Elmassian and Prober rounded out the first half with American Muczynski 's `` Time Pieces '' ( 1983 ) , an academic exercise in wandering lines , pounding piano and metric noodling -- much ado about nothing .
