British-born scientist Richard Roberts and US colleague Phillip Sharp shared the SKr6.7m ( Pounds 550,000 ) Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering split genes and advancing research on cancer and hereditary diseases . They independently discovered that genes could be present in DNA not just as one but as several separated segments . This led to the discovery of splicing - the assembly of information from the segments .
