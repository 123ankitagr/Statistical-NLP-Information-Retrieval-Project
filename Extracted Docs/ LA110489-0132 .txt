Security Pacific Corp. , stung by Arizona 's continuing real estate woes , said Friday that it will substantially increase loan-loss reserves for its bank there and put the unit 's problem loans into a separate holding company . The loan-loss reserves -- money set aside to cover future losses -- will be boosted by an unspecified amount in the fourth quarter , but earnings in the period are still expected to be higher than a year earlier , Security Pacific said . That is because the move will be offset by gains from sales of assets , including an office in Singapore , said John F. Kooken , Security Pacific 's chief financial officer . Separately , the Los Angeles-based banking company said its Security Pacific Bancorp Northwest subsidiary has reached agreement to buy Mountain West Savings Bank in Idaho for $ 31.5 million . The bank would be Security Pacific 's first in that state , a spokesman said . Security Pacific , parent of Security Pacific National Bank in Los Angeles , is one of a number of banks hurt by Arizona 's soft real estate market . Last month , for example , First Interstate Bancorp , the Los Angeles-based parent of First Interstate Bank , reported a loss of $ 15.5 million stemming from problem loans at its Arizona bank . Kooken said in an interview that Security Pacific 's Arizona bank has lost $ 50 million after taxes through the first nine months of the year . Kooken said Security Pacific has $ 465 million in non-performing loans in Arizona , about 40 % of its portfolio there . Putting those assets into a separate company will allow Security Pacific to deal more easily with its problems in the state , he said .
