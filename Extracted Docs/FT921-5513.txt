Mr Menachem Begin , former Israeli prime minister who negotiated the Camp David peace agreement with Egypt , was critically ill last night after a heart attack at his Tel Aviv home , writes Hugh Carnegy . The condition of Mr Begin , aged 78 and a near recluse since he resigned as premier in 1983 , was said to have improved during the day . But he remained unconscious and was on a respirator . Mr Begin won the Nobel peace prize jointly with the late President Anwar Sadat of Egypt for the 1979 accords .
