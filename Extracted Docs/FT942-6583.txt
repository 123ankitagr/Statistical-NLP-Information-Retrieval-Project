the north korean nuclear issue may be referred by the us and south korea soon to the united nations security council for punitive action following pyongyang's refusal to allow international inspectors to examine fuel rods being withdrawn from its nuclear reactor the international atomic energy agency reported at the weekend that negotiations with north korea on the inspection of fuel rods had broken down with pyongyang continuing to remove them in spite of iaea protests the iaea wants to analyse the rods to determine whether north korea has previously diverted plutonium produced by the 5 mw reactor for its suspected nuclear weapons programme but north korea refused all iaea proposals to secure some of the 8,000 fuel rods to verify that the reactor core is the original installed in 1986 the reactor was shut down for 100 days in 1989, leading to speculation that north korea removed some of the plutonium-rich fuel rods to make nuclear devices the us and south korea have warned that if inspection is blocked they would ask the un for economic sanctions on north korea pyongyang has said this would be an act of war there is a faint hope the issue could be resolved since two iaea inspectors remain at the north's yongbyon nuclear complex to supervise the rods removal which is half completed north korea said it would not comply with the iaea's demand concerning the fuel rods since it claimed a unique status referring to its move to withdraw from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty a year ago
