instead sharp edge scalpel massive blast toxic chemicals wipe illness doctors turning body heal they taking bodys natural products hormones antibodies enzymes even whole cells attack disease restore normal functioning cancer parkinsons disease heart disorders hormone deficiencies targets new approach treating illness harnessing new natural agents produced body might called biological therapy biotherapy much toxic chemicals used treat cancer called chemotherapy it started geneticengineering revolution 1970s scientists learned manipulate genes laboratory previously rare human proteins interferon interleukin2 human insulin humangrowth factor could suddenly mass produced new geneengineering techniques although early experiments human patients failed live expectations solid gains made physicians remain optimistic role biotherapies in next decade major advance genetic therapies said bruce a chabner director national cancer institutes division cancer treatment genetic manipulation example increasingly studied way fight diseases cancer aids the idea biotherapies around decades though first ones crude cow insulin protein essential signaling cells pull sugar blood discovered 1920s injected bodies diabetics vaccination injection living inactive virus bacteria body showed possible manipulate bodys natural defenses the immune system programmed prevent subsequent infection particular bacteria virus just world war ii doctors discovered blood could transfused individuals and beginning 1960s came organ transplants heart lungs liver pancreas kidney even bone marrow the common factor standard treatments use natural substances cells transfusion organs transplants viruses vaccines protein insulin but limited blood doesnt always match organs rejected improperly prepared vaccines cause disease intended prevent most problems came incomplete understanding biology the new generation biotherapies changing putting doctors hands powerful treatments ever developed biotherapies fall generally three groups proteins genes cells in last five years physicians putting use natural medicines produced first time biotechnology labs genetic engineers learned put specific human genes bacteria turning bacteria miniature factories grow large quantities human proteins doctors use certain disease the new protein biotherapies include clot busters several natural proteins found rapidly dissolve blood clots physicians routinely inject clot busters stop heart attacks midattack something never possible additionally drugs also used experimentally stop strokes open painful blockages leg arteries blood boosters a set proteins found stimulate bone marrow produce red blood cells certain types white blood cells growing red blood cells revolutionizing care endstage renal failure causes body stop making blood before discovery patients needed constant transfusions stimulating white blood cells boosts immunity various types infections it prevent secondary diseases associated aids its important use however may countering immunedestroying effects cancer chemotherapy thus allowing physicians treat tumors larger doses poisonous drugs kill cancer height control humangrowth factor literally add inches children short stature they dont always reach normal height reach heights previously impossible some also talked using powerful hormone weight loss reports use athletes seeking extra edge antibodies the bodys immune system produces thousands differentshaped proteins called antibodies recognize invading bacteria viruses shape attack scientists learned make antibodies given type called monoclonal antibodies used diagnose disease lab body used attack cancer cells directly organ transplants blood transfusions led way use living cells tissues treat illness but new biotherapies take quantum leap brain transplants clearly brain transplanted parts brain wear uncertain reasons parkinsons disease arises loss certain brains cells produce chemical needed normal movement neurosurgeons experimented transplanting brain patches human cells produce missing chemical preliminary experiments nerve cells taken aborted fetuses reportedly show promise tissue transplants in diabetes pancreatic cells stop secreting protein insulin although insulin injected every day control blood sugar better pancreas transplanted body a number human experiments way inject insulinmaking cells hope work better easier protect rejection killing cancer researchers national cancer institute found certain white blood cells primed attack cancers they remove cells stimulate lab growth factor called interleukin2 once several billion white blood cells grown lab put back patients body attack tumor more half patients skin cancer malignant melanoma kidney cancer respond treatment the third general form biotherapy genetic relies recent ability insert genes cells body genes control production proteins gene transfers used replace missing protein permanently this future medicine many believe about 4000 inherited diseases could attacked technology first steps in first gene transfer experiments humans begun last year national institutes health cancer researchers put bacterial gene white blood cells already turning cancer killers the gene allows track altered blood cells body see type best kills cancer future experiments genes added boost cells cancerkilling power artificial organs the biggest problem gene therapy getting altered cells back body survive one approach development animals creates artificial organ growing genemodified cells synthetic pad surgically placed animals abdomen hormones added make blood vessels grow pad theoretically newly created organ could designed secrete protein treat wide array illnesses although new biotherapies begun radically alter treatment disease also created controversies for example tissue transplanted diabetes parkinsons comes aborted fetuses groups opposed abortion strongly opposed use material government longer funds related research the debate grow intense massive project identify analyze every single human gene developed nih gets way it speed ability detect diseases nothing done that means doctors able tell patients likely get diseases will patients want know
