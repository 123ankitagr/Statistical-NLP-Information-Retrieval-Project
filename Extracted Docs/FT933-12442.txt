THE Ontario government has urged any of the province 's 9m residents who had a blood transfusion between 1978 and 1985 to be tested for the HIV virus . The warning stems from the growing number of cases which have come to light of people who were infected with the virus before blood was screened closely for it . Mrs Ruth Grier , the province 's health minister , estimated tests could involve tens of thousands . The chief medical officer has written to all doctors in the province . Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children has identified at least five HIV-positive cases since issuing a similar call earlier this year for patients who received blood transfusions in the early 1980s . None of these patients has so far developed Aids symptoms . Canada began enforcing heat-treatment of blood products , which kills the HIV virus , in November 1985 . However , allegations have been made that the government and the Red Cross , which collects blood donations , delayed the heat-treatment regulations . A Canadian television documentary claimed earlier this week that the Red Cross continued to stock blood products that had not been heat-treated for several months after warnings by the government that reliance on these products ' can not be justified ' . The federal government offered compensation packages of CDollars 120,000 ( Dollars 94,000 ) in 1989 to any haemophiliac or hospital patient who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion . So far , about 940 people , including 266 blood-transfusion recipients , have qualified for the payments . Any recipient is required to waive future legal claims against the government . Several provinces have also agreed to pay compensation .
