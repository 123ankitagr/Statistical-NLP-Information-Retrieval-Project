the bundesbank was warned yesterday that it will damage both the german economy and its own reputation and policies if it does not relax its hardline campaign against inflation as the banks central council met to fix its money supply targets for 1993 an important signpost for its future interest rates policy the authoritative diw economics institute in berlin claimed inflation was under control one can predict with great certainty that west german inflation will sink in 1993 and in following years it said the institute said central bank policymakers should focus on establishing a monetary policy based on the economys ability to expand rather than a policy based on its own inflation ideals although prices are rising at almost twice the 2 per cent rate sought by the bank implying that interest rate cuts were needed the institute said impatience over achieving its inflation goal at a time when the economy was losing momentum would be damaging it argued that reluctance among western companies to invest would endanger recovery in the east this in turn would make it more difficult for the federal government at present the main source of capital and income in the former east germany to rein in spending in this case if the bundesbank interpreted its inflation aims too narrowly its appeals to government employers and unions for action to ensure stability would lose their credibility the institute said diw which has close contacts with the bundesbank was one of the leading institutes which recently advised the bank to increase its midrange money supply target for next year to 7 per cent the current comparable figure is 45 per cent while the october annual growth rate in the m3 measure was over 10 per cent m3 which comprises sight deposits deposits of less than four years maturity most savings accounts and circulating cash is usually viewed by the bank as an indicator of inflation trends the results of yesterdays m3 meeting due to be announced today are widely expected to involve a wider target range with the upper limit raised significantly above the current 55 per cent the lower limit now 35 per cent is forecast to change less this would send a signal that the bank still has to be convinced that inflation is under control this years 45 per cent m3 midrange figure stems mainly from the banks estimate of 25 per cent growth potential in the economy and its ideal 2 per cent inflation rate main elements in the economic institutes recommendation of 7 per cent are potential growth of 3 per cent actual growth is expected to be nil and 3 per cent inflation expected to be at least 35 per cent
