after one of the most turbulent week's on the foreign exchange markets this year dealers are focused on one issue whether the bundesbank will tighten monetary policy at its council meeting on thursday writes james blitz there are strong indications of a feverish behind-the scenes debate among bundesbank members over the issue and every chance that a tightening will take place those council members in favour will argue that m3 money supply now shows annual growth of around 9 per cent against an annual target range of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent what will the bundesbank do mr gerard lyons chief economist at dkb international says the germans are unlikely to alter the m3 target for fear of losing credibility he believes that there is some chance that the bundesbank will impose limits on the amounts of funds that could be borrowed by banks at the lombard rate but there is a danger that such action could result in higher money market rates and eventually force the lombard rate to rise but mr mark cliffe chief economist at the nomura research institute in london says that a rate rise could exacerbate the growing money supply if events follow a similar course to the last two rate hikes and long yields fall he says the effect on long term credit demand could actually be expansionary moreover the effect on long term capital formation will be contractionary with short term investments becoming even more attractive of course that argument was made in reverse to explain why the federal reserve would not dare to cut its discount rate ten days ago it did the market will have to sit this one out until thursday afternoon
