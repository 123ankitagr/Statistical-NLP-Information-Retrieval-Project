Hopes rose yesterday that the kidnapping of two Britons in Indian-held Kashmir might be ended quickly . The Harakat-ul-Ansar group told Reuter in Srinagar it had held the Britons because they had 'strayed into our camp area in a suspicious way . We will release them as soon as we have shifted our camps . ' However , officials were treating the undertaking with caution because previous statements by the group have been contradictory . Mr Kim Housego , 16 , and Mr David Mackie , 36 , were abducted on Tuesday by Moslem militants who originally demanded the release of three jailed guerrilla leaders . Mr David Fitton , first secretary of the British High Commission in New Delhi , said the rebels had allowed a local doctor to visit the hostages to examine Mr Mackie , who had injured his knee . Mr Fitton , who is in Srinagar , said the Kashmiri doctor discovered that both captives were in good condition .
