We in the disability community were euphoric over the choice of Daniel Day-Lewis as best actor for `` My Left Foot . '' But our bubble was burst by Joan Collins . In a TV interview , Collins expressed awe at the talent of Day-Lewis , a handsome actor , she said , `` who could make himself look so ugly ! '' This remark was a slap to the 43 million disabled Americans . `` Ugly , '' she said of a character with cerebral palsy . This is Hollywood ; this is where images are made . If society must change its negative image of persons with disabilities , this is where it ought to start . `` Ugly '' is not how a person deviates from the physical norm ; ugly instead is prejudice .
