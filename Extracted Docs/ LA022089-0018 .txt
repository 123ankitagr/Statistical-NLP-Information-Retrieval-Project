Seven barges carrying gasoline broke free from a towboat Sunday on the Ohio River and spilled an estimated 40,000 gallons of fuel into the river after striking a railroad bridge piling , officials said . Recovery of the gasoline was impossible because it had been diluted , said Rich Carter , assistant chief of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency 's Office of Emergency Response . `` No impact has been observed thus far , '' he said . Other downstream communities close enough to be affected draw their water from wells or underground aquifers , Carter said . The river 's speedy flow makes the spill unlikely to affect water supplies or aquatic life much , he said . The rain-swollen Ohio River crested Saturday at 52.2 feet , inches above flood stage , and was falling Sunday . The spill posed the most immediate threat to the Louisville , Ky. , water system about 100 miles downstream . Gasoline tends to float on the water 's surface , and authorities said water systems served by the river could close their intakes until the gasoline floats past . The spill occurred downstream from Cincinnati 's intakes , officials said . The barges were being pushed down the river by the towboat MV Super America from an Ashland Oil Inc. refinery at Ashland , Ky. , to an Ashland products terminal on the river in Cincinnati . Officials at the scene said several other towboats helped recapture the loose barges . Carter said two oil company facilities were draining the remaining gasoline from the leaking barges .
