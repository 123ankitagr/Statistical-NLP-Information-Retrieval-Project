A recycling policy for all materials used by the city -- including recycled paper , asphalt , machinery and solvents -- has been unanimously approved by the City Council . By adopting the policy last week , the city will purchase recycled products as long as they meet required standards and the cost is not more than 5 % over the price of virgin products . Not all recycled products prove cost-efficient . Although the city can save almost 20 % in costs for recycled letter pads and envelopes , the price increases by 25 % for recycled white paper , according to a report by Simone Friend , the city purchasing manager . The city also plans to reduce paper use by photocopying on both sides of a sheet . It also will avoid purchases of glossy paper and plastic foam containers that can not be recycled . Mayor Laurann Cook said that by adopting the policy the city can set an example for citizens and other cities to follow . ROSE APODACA
