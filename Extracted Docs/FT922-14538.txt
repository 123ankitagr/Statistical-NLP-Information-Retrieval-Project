THE Belgian Government yesterday gave the go-ahead for the long-delayed alliance between Sabena , the loss-making state-owned airline , and Air France , the French national carrier . Under the deal , Air France and its Belgian financial partners , led by the Groupe Bruxelles Lambert holding company , will pay BFr6bn ( Pounds 102m ) for a 37.5 per cent stake in Sabena . The stake will be owned by a holding company two thirds owned by Air France - which accordingly contributes BFr4bn to the total - and one third owned by the Belgian financial institutions . Sabena will still be open to other international airline partners , as demanded by the Belgian government , said Mr Guy Coeme , the communications minister . The chairmen of both airlines welcomed the government 's agreement , which Air France said would allow important industrial and commercial gains . Air France and Sabena will co-operate on flights to and from their main airports , Roissy-Charles de Gaulle and Zaventem , Brussels . Air France said yesterday they were studying a Paris-Brussels air shuttle to make connections between their respective international routes . Sabena will adopt computer systems compatible with those of Air France , and the pair plan to co-operate on maintenance , engineering and refuelling . This should lead to savings on investments and stocks , said Air France . They will also study co-ordinating equipment purchasing . This ends months of uncertainty in the latest case of international airlines seeking partnership deals in response to market deregulation . The Belgian airline has been looking for a partner for over a year . Air France emerged as favourite last autumn , ahead of British Airways , but talks had to be suspended in October while Belgium sorted out its political crisis . SAS looks for cupid , Page 19
