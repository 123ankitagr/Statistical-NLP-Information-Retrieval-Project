The agreement to return major league umpires to exhibition baseball games fell apart Wednesday when the umpires and management could not agree on an arbitrator . Originally , Judge Stanley Greenberg was to consider the umpires ' protest over the rescheduling of games without their input following the end of the spring training lockout . But management went to U.S. District Court Wednesday , asking Judge Norma Shapiro to disqualify Greenberg for undisclosed reasons . Judge Shapiro refused the request and when the two sides went back before Greenberg , he disqualified himself at management 's request . That sent the two sides back before Shapiro , who tried to get them to agree to another arbitrator . Among the names suggested were former Commissioner Peter Ueberroth and former Vice President Walter Mondale , but the two sides could not agree . The umpires and baseball are due back in Shapiro 's courtroom today , when management will pursue its request for a preliminary injunction to prevent the work stoppage .
