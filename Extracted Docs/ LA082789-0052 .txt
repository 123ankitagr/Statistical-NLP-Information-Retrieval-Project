Re Marilyn Brown 's Aug. 13 letter condemning the ad for the film `` Parenthood '' that depicts Steve Martin holding two children upside down by their ankles : Oh , thank the Lord ! Yet another repressed individual with a pen and a stamp has done us a public service , demanding this ad be withdrawn because of the potential hazards of holding a child upside down . Let me finish the list : If Rhett really held Scarlett as he did in the `` Gone With the Wind '' poster , she would have developed scoliosis ; if Robin Williams had been dropped as he was being carried in the ad for `` Dead Poet 's Society , '' he could have knocked out a tooth ; if Dennis Quaid had fallen off the piano in `` Great Balls of Fire '' he could have suffered a brain aneurysm , causing him to dress like a giant bat and fight crime . It 's time to stop dropping our mouths over rock lyrics , to stop writing complaints to `` Married With Children , '' to stop being so uptight . As `` Parenthood '' suggests , roll with life ; lighten up . I remember when my father used to hold me upside down -- and I smile . BRIAN S. DAY Temple City
