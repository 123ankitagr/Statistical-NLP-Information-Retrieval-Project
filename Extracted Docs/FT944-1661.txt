The Poslum family has finally lost control of Dylex , the financially troubled Canadian fashion chain . River Road ( Canada ) , the Canadian arm of the US investment fund , becomes Dylex 's biggest investor with about 13 per cent of the stock on a fully diluted basis . The Dylex board decided last week to omit dividends on the A stock for the eighth consecutive quarter . Under the company 's by-laws this automatically gave the vote to 69m A shares outstanding , far outweighing the Poslum family 's control though the voting B shares . River Road holds 5m A shares and also convertible debentures . Assuming conversion it would hold a 13 % voting interest against the family 's 6 per cent . The board will have a majority of outside directors after being reduced in number from 18 to 12 , including two River Road representatives . River Road had fought for omitting dividends , saying Dylex could not afford any pay-out . Mr Robert Poile , a River Road managing partner who will become a director , said : 'Dylex is open to takeover but we want to get it functioning properly and realising its potential . ' Dylex reported a third-quarter net loss of CDollars 110m ( USDollars 79.1m ) or CDollars 1.55 a share , including CDollars 116m of special charges , against a loss of CDollars 2.5m or 4 cents a year ago . Sales fell 2 per cent to CDollars 436m . The nine-month loss was CDollars 132m or CDollars 1.87 a share , against a loss of CDollars 9.5m or 16 cents on sales of CDollars 1.2bn against CDollars 1.3bn . Dylex A shares have fallen from a 1989 high of CDollars 12 to 61 cents because of heavy losses from over-expansion and the long recession . The Posluns came under strong criticism for their operating policies . 'The fundamentals and a weak balance sheet have forced their hands as much as River Road , ' said Mr David Brodie , analyst with Wood Gundy . River Road 's parent is Paloma Group , a large US investment fund .
