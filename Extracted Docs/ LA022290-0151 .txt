northern orange county scored the greatest improvement increasing by 22 points to an average of 352 that score put it in the 98th percentile of districts statewide at the districts only junior high school principal mike condiff credited the improvement to his staff and to a classroom configuration that gives students two consecutive periods of language arts and lumps the schools highest

three points higher than the state average educators there said they were still reviewing the scores fred lange director of the county education departments effective schools unit attributed orange countys generally strong scores to the emphasis area schools have placed on writing in recent years some districts have also been especially effective at teaching students whose native language is not english he added were dealing with many students who come from foreignlanguage backgrounds and teaching them writing is an important part of their education lange said i think youll find that our students probably will always be a little bit above the state average local educators were particularly gratified by the progress made in santa ana which with 43000 students is orange countys largest district and the ninth biggest in the state more than half of the districts students have limited english skills still writing scores there increased 11 points to 259 for the first time overtaking the state average santa ana is to be commended for the tremendous work that they are doing especially with dealing with their large population of students who have limited english skills lange said santa

categories autobiographical incident evaluation problem solution report of information firsthand biography story observational writing or speculation about causes or effects the essays were graded on the thinking and writing processes they displayed as well as on basic skills such as spelling and grammar because the exam moves away from multiplechoice testing it has won high praise from some testing experts cinthia schuman executive director of fairtest a watchdog group campaigning for better ways of measuring student achievement praised californias writing test as moving in the right direction statewide girls continued to score markedly higher on the writing test than did boys a pattern that has shown up every year since 1987 when the test was first administered this year girls scored an average of 280 while boys averaged 232 the cap tests which are administered annually to almost all california students at various grade levels are not meant as barometers of individual students performance rather they are used to evaluate schools and the effectiveness of their curricula while orange county educators said their continued success in the writing scores was evidence of the countys strong commitment to teaching those skills bill honig state superintendent of public instruction worried that the statewide trend is not as positive honig said the onepoint dip in scores might be attributable to the addition of two new writing categories in the eightessay test but added that its clear we still have a long way to go in developing our students writing abilities although some teachers and educators complain that cap scores oversimplify a schools educational performance honig said wednesday that a recent survey indicates that the cap writing test is successfully influencing the english curriculum in middle and junior high schools more than 90 of english teachers polled said they believe that the cap writing test will improve or strengthen their schools english curricula honig said staff writer jane merl in los angeles contributed to this report orange county grade 8 writing assessment test scores california assessment program scores for eighth grade
