a startup swiss company has developed a polymer compound that provides continuously adjusted balancing for the life of a vehicle tyre when applied to its inside wall everbalance led by swedish entrepreneur bertil carnehammar claims its compound lengthens significantly the life of tyres and provides a more comfortable ride for passengers than tyres balanced with conventional lead weights so far testing of the compound has been concentrated on commercial vehicles but it is now being extended to cars the development is based on the discovery that vibrations caused by imbalances in the tyre and rim of a vehicle will cause a liquid within the tyre to move away from the source of the vibration carnehammar a former marketing executive with philips and rank xerox says he and his colleagues learned of this phenomenon by reading patent applications for compounds designed to seal tyre punctures the origin of their own research was in fact a tyre sealant compound that had been developed by a danish scientist for volvo in the early 1980s however they soon became disenchanted with the notion of sealing and concentrated on balancing the challenge was to develop a compound that had the properties of a liquid but would also adhere all around the inside wall of the tyre when the vehicle was stationary it also had to be viscous in all climates nontoxic noncorrosive and effective on several types and sizes of tyre by 1988 they were sufficiently satisfied to begin road tests with a few us fleet operators the reception was very good but people did not come back carnehammar recalls it seems that customers were nervous about putting a chemical compound in their tyres also tyre manufacturers threatened to invalidate warranties this forced everbalance into new research and testing to prove that the compound would have no ill effects on tyres this has now been completed and the group with endorsements from recognised german and us testing organisations is starting general distribution the compound which is made mainly from nontoxic glycol cellulose fibres and corrosion inhibitors sells for about dollars 25 per kilogram enough for one truck tyre carnehammar says the increase in tyre life varies with brands and with vehicle types but 20 per cent is typical it will not work on tyres that are more than 500g out of radial balance nor on tyres with a significant lateral imbalance one of the main distributors is sumitomo corporation the japanese trading company at the centre of a group that includes tyremaker sumitomo rubber carnehammar says that tyre companies still reeling from the reduction in their sales caused by the universal adoption of longlasting radial tyres are unhappy about the introduction of a product that will make their tyres last still longer but sumitomo concluded that the compound would be successful and saw it as an opportunity to build market share everbalance hopes to introduce a balancing compound for cars next year but development has proved complicated whereas the normal life of a truck tyre is a year or less car tyres tend to remain in service longer so the products endurance must be ensured and it must be tested on a much wider range of tyres some 200 compared with 30 truck tyre types also the existing formula does not perform well at speeds of above 100mph although that would seem to be a problem only in germany
