many people heard human genome project $ 3billion 15year effort map 50000 100000 genes make blueprint human life its one federal governments big science projects along $ 6billion superconducting supercollider $ 14billion hubble space telescope but many know mouse genome project or rice genome project how efforts map genes worms tomatoes yeast fruit flies wheat onions lettuce bacteria tiny weed called arabodopsis the projects functional purpose mapping genes fruit flies tiny nematode worm caenorhabditis elegans example help scientists understand similar biochemical functions humans vision works cell death occurs tracking rice wheat genomes may keep worlds burgeoning population famine the mouse project among things help tackling enormous human genome project validating mapping techniques but projects also contributing overriding theme humans different separate species long imagined the real message life extremely similar said tom roderick senior staff scientist jackson laboratory bar harbor me were humming moving along together cells behaving similarly mapping various plant animal species genomes key unraveling chemical blueprint determines characteristics living organisms resistance particular disease lettuce cause disease alzheimers humans mapping genome consists locating landmarks identified genes chromosome genetic mapping links particular gene chromosome studying expression gene successive generations this type mapping going since 1911 gene human color blindness traced several generations families it linked gene determines female gender thus determined x chromosome with advent recombinant technologies 1970s scientists began isolate piece dna genetic blueprint life restriction enzymes cut specific sequence along chain clone make detailed physical maps physical maps use molecular techniques locate genes identified sequences dna associated genes particular part chromosome humans 3 billion chemicalletter steps base pairs arranged 23 pairs chromosomes on 50000 100000 genes the definitive mapping sequencing identify base pairs genome order one end chromosome the physical maps two singlecell organisms bakers yeast bacteria escherichia coli essentially complete in animal kingdom nematode worm c elegans close behind one amazing projects come biology the story nematode began sydney brenner english scientist medical research councils laboratory medical biology cambridge set goal 1963 know know manycelled animal he chose tiny transparent worm longer millimeter three hundred fit biologists petri dish their life span three days after nearly three decades research brenner graduate students continued project labs know little worm 959 cells like constructing family tree scientists traced lineage cell original egg cell they also completed wiring diagram 302 neurons humans 100 billion neurons connections make worms nervous system now physical map nearly complete scientists decided sequence worms 100 million base pairs 3000 8000 genes when done project estimated last 10 years know tiny worm multicelled animal having coding information help scientists study biological mechanisms organisms said robert horvitz professor biology massachusetts institute technology cambridge mass researches cell death by identifying series genes involved cell death worm information studying cell death humans clinically important said there lots neurodegenerative diseases cell death involved alzheimers parkinsons its basic component stroke trauma heart attack the fruit fly mainstay study genetics also provide clues human functions effort map genome began three years ago for example said dan hartl head genetics department washington university school medicine st louis components fruit flys visual system humans we identify receives light protein signals next protein changes tell organism seen something said the physical map fruit fly completed two three years hartl said sequencing i want identify sequence genes fruit fly hartl said im still young enough 47 done professional lifetime for years model species plant world weed called arabodopsis miserable little beast said richard michelmore uc davis lettuce researcher its green thing see cracks pavement but relatively small number base pairs 70 million ability grow eight 12 life cycles year prompted founding cooperative genome project year it funded us department agriculture us department energy national institutes health national science foundation a separate project plant genome project scientists scrambling $ 11 million usda spread among mapping rice wheat barley onion corn wheat soybean tomato lettuce smaller veggies according project director jerome miksche us department agriculture but scientists relying usda michelmore completed map lettuces nine chromosomes consisting 2 billion base pairs receives part funding california lettuce growers he care sequencing entire genome instead focusing isolating genes disease resistance goal incorporating lettuce crops disease resistance hot topic said we dont know works organism ray rodriguez uc davis genetics professor began coordinating usjapanese effort map rice genome two years ago learned japan started rice genome project his primary concern pushing project ward world famine in 1970s worldwide production rice primary source nutrition 60 worlds population 80 caloric intake 2 billion asians accelerated result green revolution spread results classical plant breeding countries now race keep population demand rodriguez said were looking way create second green revolution with acceptance human genome project decided time ripe rice although genetic engineering plants touted solution feeding worlds future millions longterm solution rodriguez said least 20 years away but demand rice double within next 20 years a shortcut map genes rice chromosomes enabling plant breeders use genetic probes determine desired genes salt tolerance drought resistance survived offspring cross breeding the genome project closely linked human genome project mouse officially began sept 1 although scientists mapping parts mouse chromosomes years so much mouse human dna alike 90 scientists suggest mouse genome mapped human one since mice inbred track genes something done humans easier develop genetic maps quickly but political reasons interest getting human genome done said joe nadeau jackson laboratory scientist working project early medical benefits human genome project come identifying genetic diseases devising tests detect diseases people the quintessential laboratory animal model mouse 20 chromosomes number base pairs genes humans many scientists study mouse human genome together that approach provides clues molecular evolution determining parts dna sequence conserved humans human mouse trees separated 65 million 70 million years ago it also helps looking human disease genes finding disease genes mouse first figure look human genome so far 2720 loci genes dna markers associated genes located mouse map 1884 located human map 535 i know going lots said roderick its healthy human beings know arent somehow different apart special roderick said if take origin life earth make height washington monument human beings postage stamp top proving still experiment to think special brain going keep us going isnt necessarily true evolution trying intelligence it may work simple combinations make up complex ladder dna all genes whether plants animals made dna deoxyribonucleic acid dna made four chemical bases adenine a thymine t cytosine c guanine g these bases arranged pairs a bonds t c bonds g form steps dnas twisting ladder known double helix genes chains sequences chemicalletter steps along dna they code particular proteins perform functions necessary cells function in genes long stretches junk dna described scientists dont yet know function the dna cell divided long thin strands called chromosomes wind throughout nucleus cell during cell division chromosomes constrict short fat segments resembling rice grains seen microscope all dna cells chromosomes called genome humans 3 billion chemicalletter steps base pairs arranged 23 pairs chromosomes on 50000 100000 genes an average gene made 30000 base pairs fruit flies hand 10000 genes 165 million base pairs arranged four chromosomes one would expect humans complex would genetic material species they dont wheat 4 billion base pairs pine trees 5 billion salamanders 90 billion but fewer genes humans
