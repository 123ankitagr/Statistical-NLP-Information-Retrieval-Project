Doctors performing a historic liver transplant operation involving a living donor today accidentally damaged the donor 's spleen and were forced to remove it . The spleen of Terri Smith , 29 , of Schertz , Tex. , was damaged as doctors removed a portion of her liver to implant in her 21-month-old daughter , Alyssa , who suffers from biliary atresia , a spokesman for the University of Chicago Hospital said . A retractor came loose during surgery and hit the spleen , said Dr. Peter Whitington , director of pediatric transplant services . The spleen was then removed , forcing a delay in preparations for Alyssa 's surgery . The loss of the spleen will not adversely affect Smith , doctors said . Doctors said they expect the surgery on the youngster to continue into the evening .
