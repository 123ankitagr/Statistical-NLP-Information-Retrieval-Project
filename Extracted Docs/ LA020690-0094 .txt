women with pear-shaped figures who carry more weight in their thighs and buttocks than in their abdomen may agonize over their appearance but a new study finds they're at lower risk for developing breast cancer than their apple-shaped sisters who carry more weight in their abdomen than in their thighs and buttocks in fact an overweight pear-shaped woman can be at lower risk of breast cancer than a leaner apple-shaped woman according to florida researchers who published their study in the current annals of internal medicine they compared 216 breast-cancer patients with 432 control patients classifying them as apple-shaped or pear-shaped by computing their waist-to-hip ratio waist-hip ratios are computed by dividing waist measurement by hip measurement waist-hip ratios of 77 to 80 are classified as mildly apple-shaped ratios higher than 80 are termed very apple-shaped ratios from 73 to 76 are termed mildly pear-shaped those below 73 are very pear-shaped women with mildly apple-shaped figures are three times as likely to develop breast cancer said dr david v schapira a university of south florida associate professor of medicine and the study's principal investigator the risk is about equal to having a sister or mother with breast cancer he said women described as very apple-shaped have a six-fold greater risk in contrast women who are mildly pear-shaped or very pear-shaped have a low risk of getting breast cancer schapira said everybody believes diet and being fat has something to do with breast cancer said dr gary h lyman professor of internal medicine at the university of south florida and another researcher on the study this research takes the study of risks a step further it's not just excess weight or total body fat that increases breast cancer risk it's where that body fat is distributed said lyman who noted that the data needs to be confirmed by other studies the florida study isn't the first to consider the impact of body fat distribution on health recently other researchers reported that people with beer bellies have lower levels of the so-called good cholesterol hdl than those with trimmer tummies the florida scientists don't know for sure why apple-shaped women seem to be at greater risk of breast cancer but suspect a hormonal link apple-shaped women have higher levels of circulating estrogens we don't know exactly why schapira said but those higher estrogen levels are believed to increase breast cancer risk he said the good news apple-shaped women who lose weight seem to redistribute the weight in a more desirable way said lyman who is studying that possibility further when an apple-shaped woman loses weight and becomes more pear-shaped the abdominal fat cells which are bigger and more metabolically active than fat cells in the buttocks and thighs shrink proportionately more than those on the thighs or buttocks schapira said thus perhaps reducing the circulating estrogen levels the recommendations based on the study mildly apple-shaped women should pay more attention to guidelines about breast cancer prevention such as mammography schapira said physicians should pay more attention to these women in terms of counseling and encouraging them to follow prevention guidelines and a sound diet but a local cancer prevention expert disagrees dr william hindle director of the breast diagnostic center at los angeles county usc women's hospital said the study should not alter patient management a whit every woman and especially those over 40 needs to be concerned about breast cancer risk he said there's a long list of risks associated with breast cancer said hindle they're interesting and statistically valid but the important point is this every woman should be concerned about breast cancer over 75 of women with breast cancer have no risk factors except being a woman and growing older
