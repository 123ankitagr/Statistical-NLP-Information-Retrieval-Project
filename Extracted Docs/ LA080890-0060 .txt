michael almereydas twister at the nuart is set in a modern boozy kansas where flaky rich kids float off on a sea of alcohol and boredom its a movie with a slight buzz on a charming trancelike fantasy soggily alive to strange spasms and tics of character firsttime director almereyda based this movie on mary robisons 1980 novel oh which the writer says is about the frailty of adulthood the frailty of love that describes the plight of most of the central characters seem arrested in adolescence especially siblings maureen and howdy cleveland suzy amis and crispin glover unwed mother maureen or mo has the face of a cornsilk botticelli with a spray of sissy spacek freckles shes given to slouching tantrums petulant pouts brother howdy is the real oddball dressed in black with fluttery eyes and renaissance bangs hes given to cracking whips striking byronic poses and droning awful selfcomposed dirges that try to fuse newwave rock with gaelic poetry daddy was mean is his main theme howdy is an artist the way many bored bright lazy selfindulgent rich kids are artists their writing painting or movies are just like his songs and glover makes him a classic poseurhysteric fracturing his delivery so hilariously that every word is filigreed to death and every gesture is a goony ballet in rivers edge those flailing eccentric emphasises sometimes seemed a little forced here they fit perfectly its his best performance the cleveland kids dad eugene the soda pop king is played by harry dean stanton with almost hairraising delicacy and control as someone so inured to his family or so soused himself that hes beyond amazement he reacts to everything with the same crocked twinkle and amiable mellowtone when he finally throws a tantrum it has a horrific daintiness with quiet ferocity he overturns three soup bowls and sternly tells everyone to continue eating like dorothy the characters including mos exlover dylan mcdermott and a bemused black maid charlaine woodard suffer through a tornado but it doesnt spin them into any magic kingdom they simply wake up dazed again in another unbearably unstructured day what almereyda has drawn here with a mood that except for its absence of zoom shots irresistibly recalls the vaguely narcotized realsurreal atmosphere of robert altmans 70s films is the dilemma of a family sunk in riches and without a clue what to do with them setting the movie in kansas that flat land of pale skies with its echoes of both oz and in cold blood heightens the surreality it suggests the magic that wont come the terror that might when william burroughs shows up taking target practice and then ruminating on an acquaintance who shot horses and died after trying to eat a clock its a good sample of twisters humor ultradeadpan a little mean american gothic with glazed eyes almereyda fills every scene with verbal jolts and spins but he doesnt have much visual style the film suffers from a lack of modulation and also from the low budget that keeps almereyda from even trying for a simulated hurricane but twisters shortcomings can be excused because it has something new to offer a goofball penetration into the lives of the rich and tipsy halfcrocked under the rainbow seldom does a movie seem so tied to the moods and fluctuations of alcohol watching these people you can almost imagine what theyre drinking from chris sixpacks to mos whiskey and pills to dads bourbon to whatever howdy is doodling himself up with perhaps creme de menthe laced with methedrine twister rated pg13 may not have special effects or taut structure but it has something movies with reallooking tornadoes usually miss intelligence surprise a flair for the craziness of the everyday
