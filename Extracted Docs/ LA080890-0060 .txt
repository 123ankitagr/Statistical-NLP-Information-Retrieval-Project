michael almereyda's twister at the nuart is set in a modern boozy kansas where flaky rich kids float off on a sea of alcohol and boredom it's a movie with a slight buzz on a charming trance-like fantasy soggily alive to strange spasms and tics of character first-time director almereyda based this movie on mary robison's 1980 novel oh which the writer says is about the frailty of adulthood the frailty of love that describes the plight of most of the central characters seem arrested in adolescence especially siblings maureen and howdy cleveland suzy amis and crispin glover unwed mother maureen or mo has the face of a corn-silk botticelli with a spray of sissy spacek freckles she's given to slouching tantrums petulant pouts brother howdy is the real oddball dressed in black with fluttery eyes and renaissance bangs he's given to cracking whips striking byronic poses and droning awful self-composed dirges that try to fuse new-wave rock with gaelic poetry daddy was mean is his main theme howdy is an artist the way many bored bright lazy self-indulgent rich kids are artists their writing painting or movies are just like his songs and glover makes him a classic poseur-hysteric fracturing his delivery so hilariously that every word is filigreed to death and every gesture is a goony ballet in river's edge those flailing eccentric emphasises sometimes seemed a little forced here they fit perfectly it's his best performance the cleveland kids dad eugene the soda pop king is played by harry dean stanton with almost hair-raising delicacy and control as someone so inured to his family or so soused himself that he's beyond amazement he reacts to everything with the same crocked twinkle and amiable mellow-tone when he finally throws a tantrum it has a horrific daintiness with quiet ferocity he overturns three soup bowls and sternly tells everyone to continue eating like dorothy the characters including mo's ex-lover dylan mcdermott and a bemused black maid charlaine woodard suffer through a tornado but it doesn't spin them into any magic kingdom they simply wake up dazed again in another unbearably unstructured day what almereyda has drawn here with a mood that except for its absence of zoom shots irresistibly recalls the vaguely narcotized real-surreal atmosphere of robert altman's 70 s films is the dilemma of a family sunk in riches and without a clue what to do with them setting the movie in kansas that flat land of pale skies with its echoes of both oz and in cold blood heightens the surreality it suggests the magic that won't come the terror that might when william burroughs shows up taking target practice and then ruminating on an acquaintance who shot horses and died after trying to eat a clock it's a good sample of twister's humor ultra-deadpan a little mean american gothic with glazed eyes almereyda fills every scene with verbal jolts and spins but he doesn't have much visual style the film suffers from a lack of modulation and also from the low budget that keeps almereyda from even trying for a simulated hurricane but twister's shortcomings can be excused because it has something new to offer a goofball penetration into the lives of the rich and tipsy half-crocked under the rainbow seldom does a movie seem so tied to the moods and fluctuations of alcohol watching these people you can almost imagine what they're drinking from chris six-packs to mo's whiskey and pills to dad's bourbon to whatever howdy is doodling himself up with perhaps creme de menthe laced with methedrine twister rated pg-13 may not have special effects or taut structure but it has something movies with real-looking tornadoes usually miss intelligence surprise a flair for the craziness of the everyday
