i have a few questions for the irvine resident who is outraged with the irvine police department because her son was given a $ 96 ticket for failure to make a complete stop at a stop sign you claim he was a firsttime offender do you mean this was the first time he had failed to stop for a stop sign or the first time he was caught you compare his ticket with a friend you know of who received a lessexpensive ticket for the same offense did your friend only fail to stop while your son may have failed to yield the right of way to another vehicle is it possible that the policeman who ticketed your son has seen too many bicyclecar accidents in which the bicyclist is seriously injured and usually at fault and finally what kind of message are you giving your son about accepting responsibility for his actions as you leap to his defense bob cooper newport beach
