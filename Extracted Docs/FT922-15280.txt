sir i was surprised to read david weeks's letter march 31 suggesting that the jubilee line extension can be delayed on the grounds that it serves only london's docklands in addition to improving docklands access this line will provide a new high-quality central london rail link to east and south-east london serving not only the docklands area but also the residents and businesses of waterloo london bridge north southwark bermondsey greenwich canning town west ham and stratford it will also relieve several of the most congested parts of the central london rail network passengers on the central line between stratford and holborn the district and circle lines between monument and victoria and bakerloo line between paddington and oxford circus on the network southeast between stratford and liverpool street will all experience significant improvements in journey comfort the london docklands development corporation has recently engaged in discussions with westminster city council with a view jointly to promoting london to ensure that it retains its position as the premier commercial city of europe in achieving this docklands will complement the city and west end the jubilee line will play a key role in providing high-quality access between these centres and also in giving access to the channel tunnel train services at stratford it will combine with and reinforce other ongoing rail improvements to provide london with an effective public transport system to compete internationally in the future for all these reasons the jubilee line extension should continue to be supported as a priority project for london transport michael pickard chairman london docklands development corporation thames quay 19 marsh wall london e14 9 tj
