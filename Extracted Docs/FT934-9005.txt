Want Wall Street cred ? Then leave a copy of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer lying about the office . Jim Grant 's fortnightly newsletter , celebrating its tenth birthday with a fat tome of past apercus , is required reading for anyone seeking a quirky , contrarian view of the financial world and those who inhabit it . Laced , unusually for American writing , with a rich sense of irony , Grant's is written by the originator of the Current Yield column on Barron 's , the US financial weekly . When Grant went solo , Jim Rogers , George Soros 's former partner , was his first subscriber . While his wife beavered away at Lehman Kuhn Loeb , Grant got established by noisily deploring just the sort of deals she was doing . He fingered Olympia & York early on , rechristening its Canary Wharf site 'London 's own North Dakota ' . But Grant has not always been right . He admits that his greatest predictive gaff was to fail to see the 'levitation of stocks and bonds in the last couple of years ' . No surprise then that he thinks financial assets are hopelessly over-priced and commodities dirt cheap . Hence his motto for the Clinton years : 'Down with paper . Up with things ' .
