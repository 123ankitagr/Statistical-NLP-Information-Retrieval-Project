Sir , The statement in the Lex column ( 'UK economy ' , August 1 ) that ( corporate investment ) 'held up unusually well during the recession ' is not correct and the Bank of England chart apparently supporting it is misleading . That the ratio of corporate investment to gross domestic product has any appearance of being 'much higher than in the early 1980s ' is due entirely to the fact that the sector now comprises privatised industries which were previously nationalised . If allowance is made for the changing classification frontier , fixed investment fell about 20 per cent between its peak in 1989 and its trough in 1993 - a far larger fall than in previous recessions . There is no sign yet of any significant recovery . Unless it is recognised how much investment has fallen , it may be forgotten how much consumption has risen and hence why increased taxation will be needed .
