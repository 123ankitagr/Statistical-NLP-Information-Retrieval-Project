sir the statement in the lex column uk economy august 1 that corporate investment held up unusually well during the recession is not correct and the bank of england chart apparently supporting it is misleading that the ratio of corporate investment to gross domestic product has any appearance of being much higher than in the early 1980 s is due entirely to the fact that the sector now comprises privatised industries which were previously nationalised if allowance is made for the changing classification frontier fixed investment fell about 20 per cent between its peak in 1989 and its trough in 1993 a far larger fall than in previous recessions there is no sign yet of any significant recovery unless it is recognised how much investment has fallen it may be forgotten how much consumption has risen and hence why increased taxation will be needed wynne godley jerome levy economics institute annandale on hudson new york 12504, us
