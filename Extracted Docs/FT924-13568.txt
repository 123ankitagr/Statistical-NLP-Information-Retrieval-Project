the winners of the nobel physics and chemistry prizes announced in stockholm yesterday made discoveries which helped to uncover some of the most fundamental processes in science the physics laureate professor georges charpak of france invented the electronic detector which is now used in all the world's atom smashers to trace the sub-atomic particles thrown off by high-energy collisions his multi-wire proportional chamber makes it possible to collect data 1,000 times faster than the old photographic detection methods the swedish academy of sciences said in its citation prof charpak 68, works at cern the european particle physics laboratory near geneva his detector invented in the 1960 s was used by colleagues from cern who won the 1984 nobel physics prize for discovering some of the innermost structure of matter now simpler versions of the detector are being developed for more practical applications for example in detecting medical x-rays professor rudolph marcus of the us won this year's chemistry prize for his theory for what is perhaps the simplest chemical elementary process the transfer of an electron between molecules the academy said prof marcus 69, works at the california institute of technology in pasadena his theory developed during the 1950 s and 60 s has made useful predictions in many areas of chemistry including the way plants fix light energy in photosynthesis and the conduction of electricity in plastics some predictions conflicted with what chemists had previously expected these were not finally confirmed by experiment until the late 1980 s prof charpak is france's ninth physics prize winner and prof marcus is the 39 th american to win the chemistry prize each prize is worth about dollars 1.2 m this year
