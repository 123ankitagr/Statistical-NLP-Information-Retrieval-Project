The City Council approved plans this week to allow an expanded medical office building across the street from St. Jude Hospital & Rehabilitation Center . Several doctors spoke in favor of allowing a developer to replace the current 31,500-square-foot office building with a three-story building more than twice its size on the southeast corner of Harbor Boulevard and Valencia Mesa Drive in Fullerton . Doctors said they have outgrown the current building and need more office space near the hospital . Councilwoman Molly McClanahan voted against the project , saying she did not like the idea of such a large building on that corner . She asked council members to scale down the proposed 72,000-square-foot building to 60,000 square feet , but was outvoted 4 to 1 . Besides the larger building , the project also includes a four-level parking structure with 355 spaces . Initially , the developer and co-owner of the building , McBride Development Co. of Brea , had asked the city to allow a 109,000-square-foot building on the corner . But the Planning Commission and council rejected those plans last year and asked the company to come back with plans for a smaller building . As part of Tuesday 's approval , McBride Development must pay for improvements at the nearby intersection of Harbor and Bastanchury Road to ease the impact of more cars traveling to the building . Construction for the expanded office building probably will begin this fall , said James G. McGrade , vice president of the developer . TOM McQUEENEY
