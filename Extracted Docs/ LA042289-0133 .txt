Two male Mexican fruit flies have been captured within the past month in Santa Ana , and the state has launched a search , state officials said Friday . A door-to-door hunt began Friday in the neighborhoods around Bishop Street and Lingan Lane , where the flies were spotted in traps , Gera Curry , spokeswoman for the state Department of Food and Agriculture , said Friday . The second fly was found Thursday ; the first was found March 22 about 2 miles away . A fruit fly infestation could devastate California fruit crops and cause losses of more than $ 100 million , Curry said . `` We 're talking about a possible major economic loss , and we do n't want to get it started in California . '' The last fruit fly infestation was in Los Angeles County in 1983 and 1984 , and the cost to eliminate it about $ 2.7 million , Curry said . Fruit crops were not damaged . Curry asked that residents comply when state employees ask to cut fruit growing in their back yards `` to determine whether there is a breeding population . '' Anyone in the area who notices worms or maggots in a piece of fruit from a back-yard tree should call the Orange County agricultural commissioner 's office , ( 714 ) 447-7100 .
