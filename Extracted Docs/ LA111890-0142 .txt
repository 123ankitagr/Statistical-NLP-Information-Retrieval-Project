it has been good for me to see these beautiful people and this beautiful country at peace all my memories of vn were of war suffering and destruction i sort of loved this country though they sent us here for war now that its free i love it even more from the diary of charles nixon wednesday sept 12 1990 war veteran charles nixon returned to vietnam this fall chiefly for intellectual reasons to travel in a third world country and as he put it to witness firsthand the effects of us foreign policy maybe its because he was an ambulance driver during his 196667 army stint in saigon and by his own account was spared much of the wars horrors he came home to finish college hold a steady job marry a woman whos become his soul mate and start a successful contracting business hardly the tormented postwar experiences of some others he was caught off guard then by his roller coaster emotions during the recent visit and by the inexplicable power that vietnam and his longdormant memories of it held over him i expected to go back and visit a country at peace and learn more nixon said recently in the den of his woodland hills home i didnt expect to be so moved by the country it was a tremendous emotional experience for me and caught me by surprise the biggest thing for me was all i knew about vietnam all my images of vietnam were from the war and i had nothing to replace them with said nixon 46 a tall striking man who said he was brought up to fear communists and feelings now i have a whole country and people and sunsets between sept 4 and oct 30 nixon joined seven other veterans on a peace and reconciliation mission outside hanoi a sixweek adventure during which they helped rebuild a medical clinic in the village of yen vien according to the veterans vietnam restoration project vvrp the nonprofit group that organized the trip the clinic had been out of use since it was destroyed by us bombs 20 years ago nixon and his colleagues lived in a guest house with dormitorylike quarters and worked side by side with their former enemies all were in their 40s five of the eight were unmarried several suffered posttraumatic stress as a result of fighting in the war they took side trips organized by the local branch of the communist party and followed the orders of vietnamese construction managers one veteran flew home to kentucky during the first week after acknowledging that he didnt feel comfortable around the vietnamese couldnt work with them and couldnt control his paranoia others such as nixons roommate from maine grew so close to their foreign coworkers that they wept like children when they said goodby this country at peace is beautiful why did our government rain such awful destruction on these people it seems that vn is a national sore spot guess washington learned some lessons from the experience but were they the right ones the american people still dont understand the us involvement nixon diary wednesday sept 12 it was the third such trip for the 2yearold vvrp which operates with a small staff and donated funds in garberville calif although vietnam veterans of america has sponsored several tours in the past three years vvrp is the only such group that provides humanitarian aid to vietnam organizing volunteers to help build medical facilities and donating medical supplies fifteen years after the controversial war ended organized american travel to vietnam is still illegal because the us government maintains a trade embargo with the country refusing to restore normal diplomatic and commercial relations the trips sponsored by vvrp however are sanctioned under a 1987 agreement between the two countries that allows private groups to provide humanitarian aid we are actually participating in the construction of facilities and the trips are just a side matter said scott rutherford vvrps development coordinator adding that another trip is planned next fall nixon described the trip as a rewarding but extremely difficult experience in which the groups internal dynamics difficult as they were were compounded daily by the frustrations of working in a foreign culture they had to cope with language and cultural barriers the intense southeast asian heat and claustrophobic humidity ho chi minhs revenge and a debilitating virus that struck the group the trip didnt change his life nixon said but affirmed his political convictions that nations have a right to selfdetermination and the us should not interfere it also furthered his long effort to show emotion more openly on most days he would work on the construction site until the early afternoon or until he succumbed to the heat hauling buckets of concrete and bricks by hand or shoveling debris even to nixon a contractor it was backbreaking work he read a lot of vietnamese history and eventually felt relaxed enough to take long bike rides through hanoi an ancient city of parks and trees he said he prefers even to paris he had been euphoric after a fourday orientation session in rural sebastopol where a pair of psychologists helped the travelers get to know each other and guided them through their tangle of feelings the past four days have as everyone admits seemed more like four weeks as a group we seemed to have come together feel closer the selfrevelations and acceptance by others has increased feelings of trust and caring truly a unique experience i felt like i had gone through a sort of emotional basic training nixons diary on tuesday sept 4 as the group prepared to leave the united states for nixon who avoided war protests when he came home because he wanted to get on with my life it was the first time he had been exposed directly to other veterans suffering one vet told about the first time he shot someone in combat nixon said he was ambushed by three north vietnamese and shot one in the chest the guy cried out in pain twenty years later he still remembers it and feels guilty about it another a medal of honor recipient revealed a scar on his torso that looks like a road map nixon said another was homeless another had lost several friends from the bluecollar town in new england where they grew up and were drafted but group members drifted apart one of nixons biggest disappointments was that once in vietnam people retreated into their own shells and acted like they did during the war he said the group held a few loosely organized rap sessions but the meetings werent held regularly and nixons efforts to record his colleagues lives before during and after the war were rejected in a few cases increasing his loneliness and feelings of isolation nixon said he thinks future trips should include a psychologist or counselor as an escort a suggestion rutherford said vvrp was seriously considering i keep thinking all feelings are not so pleasant but they all are better than feeling dead or numb ive opened myself up to a lot of pain etc but it feels like the right thing to do reaching out to those people at the restaurant was the right thing to do even if it hurt a lot nixon diary monday oct 15 a human rights activist who has traveled in cuba and central america with his wife louise nixon was anxious to meet and talk with vietnamese and learn how the communist society worked sometimes he succeeded and on his last night in hanoi enjoyed dinner with a couple of government information agents he had talked to all afternoon but nixon said he also had a few frustrating encounters with vietnamese possibly because of the language barrier but also he thinks because of lingering bitterness from the war one evening he had struck up a conversation with a restaurant manager and she ordered a pot of tea in vietnam a gesture of friendship the womans husband joined them and after a while nixon invited the couple and their 6yearold daughter to see a movie the following night they made a date and the husband even offered to pick up nixon at his guest house but the new bond came apart when nixon got his dinner bill he realized the woman had charged him for the friendship tea and for a hot steamed towel he hadnt ordered but used to be polite nixon says he paid the higher amount although it was clear he was upset at that point he recalled the womans husband began a pantomime of a soldier with a machine gun and looking directly at nixon repeated b52 pilot b52 pilot shorthand for the ultimate enemy to the north vietnamese i was really hurt and felt betrayed nixon later wrote in his diary i felt like i opened up and made a friendly gesture and got kicked youknowwhere yet on the last day of work nixons group held a banquet for their vietnamese coworkers and many of the vietnamese and americans cried nixon included i had seen ted and truy sitting together before dinner ted 6 feet 2 inches 240 pounds carpenterveteran truy 5 feet 4 inches 130 pounds nixon wrote about his roommate and the mans vietnamese friend truy was leaning against ted with his head on teds shoulder truy the nva soldier who could have killed some of the friends that ted lost in the war was like a puppy about to be separated from his mother so was ted so was i we were all deeply moved this was the hardest parting ive ever experienced ive cried at partings a little in the past but never like this excerpts from yen vien diary sept 9 we went for walk to hanoi left 10 am
