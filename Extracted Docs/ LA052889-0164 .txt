Oozing down-home charm , Reba McEntire -- the reigning queen of country music -- is perky , friendly and outgoing . Candor is one of her assets too . `` I 'll talk about anything , '' said the quintessential good ol ' girl , whose 16th album , appropriately titled `` Sweet Sixteen , '' is already No . 11 on the country charts . `` You name it . '' Even K.T . Oslin ? `` You bet , '' she replied without skipping a beat . Oslin is the sophisticated , ultra-contemporary singer-songwriter who many country music insiders think is inching ahead of McEntire in the hearts of country fans . Recently , she 's been winning many of the awards -- notably , the Country Music Assn . and Academy of Country Music honors -- that McEntire used to collect routinely . But listening to McEntire gush about Oslin , you would n't know they 're rivals . `` K.T . 's a real spitfire -- very unpredictable , '' said the 33-year-old McEntire . `` Me and her are good friends . I love her singing . I love her albums . I nearly wore out her first album listening to it on my ( tour ) bus . My bus driver got sick of it because I played it so much . But I never got sick of it . '' Is McEntire concerned about Oslin 's apparent takeover ? `` I do n't look at myself as a queen of anything , '' McEntire said . `` I 'm just ol ' Reba , singing and performing the best I can . '' When it comes to aw-shucks humility , McEntire is hard to beat . During a recent local visit , she did a guest spot on a morning talk show , then later headed for a TV studio to tape another . `` It 's all part of making me more visible to folks , '' said McEntire . `` A lot of people outside of country have n't heard of me . We 're trying to fix that . '' -- -- McEntire is a pure country vocalist , appealing to the hard-core fans . Singing in an old-fashioned , Pasty Cline-influenced style , she displays a melodious , affecting , high-pitched wail , neatly applicable to those tear-jerking country tales . On her last two MCA albums , McEntire has been trying to broaden her appeal , using songs like Etta James ' bluesy `` Sunday Kind of Love '' and the Everly Brothers ' `` Cathy 's Clown '' -- the first single off `` Sweet Sixteen . '' Her previous LP , `` Reba , '' has been near the top of the country charts for more than a year . `` Sunday Kind of Love '' in particular revealed a new dimension of her vocal talent -- a strong pop/bluesy style she rarely gets to use . But if it was up to her hard-core audience , she would n't use it again any time soon . In a separate interview , Stan Campbell , program director of country station KLAC , noted : `` That song did n't go over well with her audience . Bluesy songs never work well with country audiences . Anyway , Reba has that hard-core country audience that does n't want her to go too far astray . '' It seems that experimentation with other musical styles has coincided with the Oslin threat . `` K.T . did n't have anything to do with it , '' McEntire insisted . `` I wanted to make a few changes . I was tired of singing the same old ballads . I just wanted to try something a little different -- for my own satisfaction . '' An Oklahoma native who was discovered in 1974 singing the national anthem at a rodeo , McEntire struggled through the '70s . She emerged from the pack in the post- '' Urban Cowboy '' period when pop influences had flooded country and threatened to sink traditional country music . When the country world threw off some of those pop shackles , McEntire was one of the artists leading the way . `` It was my time , '' McEntire said of her emergence in the mid-1980s . `` I had worked hard building an audience , refining my style . '' But it was more than that . KLAC 's Campbell cited other factors , starting with her record producer : `` When she started working with Jimmy Bowen , she really came into her own . He 's God in Nashville . And , of course , she started getting better material . Also , things changed for her when she went to MCA , a major label . It 's tough making it when you 're recording for those independent labels . They just do n't have the resources . When those things happened , that 's when Reba really took off . '' -- -- '' I 'm very dull , '' McEntire said when asked about her private life . `` There 's no scandal , nothing that would interest the National Enquirer . If their readers had to read about what I did , they 'd fall asleep . '' The closest thing to a scandal in McEntire 's life was her divorce a few years ago from rodeo champion Charlie Battles after an 11-year marriage . `` There was no great story there , '' she said . `` I was in love and then I fell out of love . Fans were upset about it . They do n't like to see that stuff . They might have been more upset about it than I was . '' To hear her talk , the life of a country music queen is one giant snore . `` What do I do ? I play golf and I work . I 'm on the road just about all the time . I play 150 dates a year . That bus is my second home -- my real home actually . `` Work is really my hobby , '' emphasized the singer , whose next local appearance is July 14 at the Celebrity Theatre . `` I ca n't wait to work . Work is exciting , but it 's still work . If you 're looking for excitement , do n't follow me around . '' The big change in her life , McEntire admitted , is that she 's calmed down in the last few years . `` I used to be so hyper , '' she said . `` I 'm more settled now . '' Did that change have anything to do with her divorce ? `` Could be , '' she said smugly . McEntire offered a nifty capsule summary of herself : '' I 'm a decent person who 's nice most of the time -- though not as much of the time as I 'd like , actually . I 'm just ol ' Reba . I 'm not very complicated . That 's for other folks . I 'm simple and I like it that way . What you see is what you get . ''
