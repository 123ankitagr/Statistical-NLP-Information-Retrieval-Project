now that i have joined the outside work force after having been at home for 20 years and hearing from everyone at home how easy i had it and my husband left it due to illness i laughed when i read it's in the male when i get home all i hear is that the laundry is done and how tired i am at these moments i recall someone i won't use names telling me how easy it is staying home and how demanding it is working outside also i recall having to let him go in our room for at least a half hour before anyone could say a word to him when i come from work every evening i am barely able to put my purse down when everyone tells me it's dinner time occasionally i run my finger on the oven hood and comment on how it needs to be cleaned at these moments we look into each other's eyes and burst out laughing perhaps it's these differences that make the world go around delia lopez sylmar
