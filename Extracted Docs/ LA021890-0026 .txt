unless youre willing to fly to london you cant possibly see miss saigon theater impresario cameron mackintoshs latest musical extravaganza but you can buy the original london cast recording this week even though the musical wont open on broadway until sometime in the spring of 1991 whats the rush through the success other labels had with les miserables and phantom of the opera weve realized theres an incredible market for cast recordings long before the show actually arrives here said geffen records president ed rosenblatt whose label is releasing the doublealbum and two cd cast recording these kinds of shows are worldwide media events in fact rosenblatt predicts that the london cast recording whose cds sell for a whopping $ 3198 the doublealbum on vinyl goes for $ 1998 will break the platinum barrier of 1 million copies sold before the show arrives in the states if so the sales success will be a testimony to the new global reach of such hightech entertainment packages as miss saigon which like its les miz predecessor is more of an event than a traditional stage musical reviewing the show which is set in crumbling 1975 saigon newsweek dubbed it madame butterfly with choppers it would be the lastest in a series of recorded stage shows that reached america before the show itself jesus christ superstar evita and chess were earlier examples of the trend its somehow fitting that geffen which owns a significant chunk of the the miss saigon production is releasing the london cast recording at a time when the record business is abuzz with reports that industry giant emi is negotiating to either buy geffen or distribute its musical releases worldwide in an era when entertainment conglomerates eagerly gobble up new product geffens release of the saigon score is a perfect example of corporate synergy miss saigon is the ultimate in synergy rosenblatt said the cast album helps advertise the show and then when people see the show they want to buy the album so it works on both ends so far this marketing scheme has paid off in record sales for geffen its distribution of cats has topped the 2 million mark while les miz is at 950000 and dreamgirls has sold a solid 500000 copies polygram records which distributes original cast recordings of both andrew lloydwebbers phantom of the opera and aspects of love has enjoyed equal success the doublecd set of phantom which was released five months before the show hit broadway has now sold nearly 15 million copies an impressive figure especially considering that polygram also released a singlecd highlights package that sold an additional 600000 copies polygram marketing chief jim urie credits the labels aggressive marketing strategy with stimulating sales after the show hit broadway polygram organized contests at many adultcontemporary radio stations sponsoring ticket giveaways and free trips to new york to see the show peoples motivations for buying scores and sound tracks are completely different said urie polygrams senior vice president of marketing people buy movie sound tracks because of a hit song but they buy original cast recordings because of the shows story line or because of the eventatmosphere surrounding it still original scores are expensive to market and produce rosenblatt says geffen has earmarked an initial ad budget of $ 500000 for the cast album which cost another $ 250000 or more to produce thankfully the media provides a generous boost of free advertising even though miss saigon isnt due here for another year the splashy show has already received writeups in time life people and newsweek and many key newspapers an awful lot of americans have already been over to london as tourists to see the show said rosenblatt and then theres always a ton of people who just want to own an original cast recording its like having a firstedition of a popular new book theyll probably want to buy the american cast recording too and talk about synergy guess wholl be putting out the american cast recording within two months of miss saigons opening day on broadway geffen records of course
