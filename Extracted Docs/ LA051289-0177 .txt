Detroit Mayor Coleman Young almost certainly fathered a baby boy six years ago , as alleged in a lawsuit by a former city employee , according to blood test results released today . The results from Edward W. Sparrow Hospital in Lansing show that Young , 70 , has a 99.99 % likelihood of having fathered Joel Loving , now of Fontana , Calif . The blood test results were released at a news conference by Noel Keane , attorney for Annivory Calvert , a former Detroit assistant director of public works who sued Young earlier this year seeking unspecified child support . Keane said Calvert also wants Young to exercise visitation rights . No date has been set for a hearing on the lawsuit .
