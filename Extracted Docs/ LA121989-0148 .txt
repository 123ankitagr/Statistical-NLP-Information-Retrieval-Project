Nobel Prize-winning novelist Gabriel Garcia Marquez faces a breach-of-agreement lawsuit filed by a movie producer who contends that the author broke a deal with him to film `` Love in the Time of Cholera . '' Richard Roth , producer of the film `` Julia , '' claims in the suit filed Monday that he had a deal with Garcia Marquez to pay $ 400,000 for film rights to the Colombian-born author 's latest international bestseller . But the deal went sour when Garcia Marquez allegedly demanded Roth hire a Latin American director to produce the film set in South America , said Roth 's attorney , Max Blecher . Roth 's financing arrangements fell through after Garcia Marquez imposed the condition , Blecher said .
