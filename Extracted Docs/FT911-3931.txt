japan's computer makers are betting that the next generation of computer users will fall into their laps literally japanese manufacturers believe their increasing supremacy in the production and sale of laptop computers will lead to a significant expansion of japan's role in the overall computer market japan's consumer electronics companies control half of the laptop and notebook market the industry's fastest growing segment and japanese dominance of such critical technologies as disk drives and liquid-crystal-displays lcds together with japanese skill at shrinking components has led such us stalwarts as ibm and apple into joint ventures with their japanese competitors while laptops account for 13 per cent and 20 per cent of the european and us pc market respectively they account for almost half of all pcs sold in japan many analysts believe the european and us figures will double within three years japanese miniaturisation techniques are sure to help them lead the emerging palmtop and tablet markets japanese companies are increasingly dominant in disk drives not only at the low end with hard drives for pcs but at the high end for mainframes the japanese have worked hard to improve their software and service in japan and hope to begin exporting such skills in the near future even with their relatively limited presence in the computer-systems and software market japanese manufacturers exported over dollars 20bn-worth of computer-related products last year some 85 per cent of which were in parts and peripherals japanese makers are increasing their control of high density storage systems as companies such as epson and nec continue to gain share at the expense of small and medium-size us makers japanese companies are certain to widen their dominant lead in display technologies including those related to high definition television hdtv sharp epson and nec have clearly established themselves as the world's leaders in lcd technology south korea and taiwan their closest competitors are years behind while us makers are virtually non-existent such technologies are growing in importance as hdtv-related systems are used in a widening variety of applications including workstations which are still dominated by us companies there's no use in having a rolls-royce engine if you have a poor monitor says mr barry dargan an analyst at james capel pacific in tokyo japanese producers are forging ahead in other areas including taking industry leader ibm head-on in mainframes japanese producers including nec hitachi fujitsu and toshiba believe their growing presence in pcs will propel them into complete systems integration particularly as the mainframe market matures relative to pcs nec boasts the fastest supercomputer in the world the sx-3 japanese service networks continue to trail their us competitors notably ibm however toshiba and nec continue to improve their growing sales channels in the us while fujitsu's purchase of icl has catapulted japan's largest mainframe maker into the forefront of european sales and distribution network channels although the japanese still trail in the development of software for export japanese companies have become highly skilled at designing operating software systems for the japanese market hitachi and fujitsu in particular have devoted significant resources to the development of world-class software such investments will pay off in the future particularly as the world moves in the direction of more open industry standards such as unix the operating system developed by a t t which seems destined to become a world standard for small computers in the end japanese computer makers greatest strength may be the growing dominance of other japanese industrial sectors as japanese industries such as automobiles pharmaceuticals and steel continue to expand and automate they are sure to bring japanese computer makers along with them it's much tougher for japanese computer makers to sell to gm than to toyota or nissan says mr steven myers an analyst at jardine fleming in tokyo given that pc use in japanese offices is one half that of europe and one quarter that in the us japan's internal market is poised for a period of explosive growth japan's estimated y7 000 bn information technology market is the world's second largest and is expected to more than double by the end of the decade most of the increase in sales will fall to japanese makers japanese companies will continue to prefer to grow internally however more companies may resort to either taking equity positions or outright acquisitions in fields in which japanese companies trail such as processing technologies and software the japanese have to catch up in some areas and they know it says mr dargan if they can't do it themselves they'll engage in joint ventures or acquisitions joint ventures such as nmb-intel are bound to increase as capital-starved us companies increasingly turn to their deep-pocketed japanese competitors small west coast tech houses are vulnerable to being cherry-picked says mr dargan pointing to tdk's dollars 200 m acquisition of silicon systems in 1989 still japan's dearth of software programmers estimated at 600,000 is expected to top 1 m by the end of the century such a shortfall argue most analysts can only partially be made up by subcontracting work to korea and china and by buying small us producers but japanese computer makers remain undaunted if anything the only impediments most japanese companies see in the way of their inevitable advance are political fujitsu for one has been extremely wary of a political backlash in europe following its purchase of icl and its exclusion from three of the five european research consortia to which icl belonged consequently japanese makers will continue the less risky strategy of supplying european makers on an oem basis japanese manufacturers realise they just can't take market share through competition alone says mr dargan japanese companies are diffusing proprietary technologies in south-east asia as the newly industrialized economies nies repeat japan's previous policy of insisting on technology transfer in return for access to their markets us companies burned by their liberal sharing of technology with japanese companies in the past are trying to demand a more equitable sharing of know-how
