everybody who celebrates christmas is looking forward to tomorrow afternoon miss manners trusts yes she knows that you plan to open your presents in the morning or perhaps christmas eve night what she had in mind was the happy anticipation of spending christmas afternoon writing thank-you letters what an opportunity this is to curl up cozily in a favorite corner with a trusted old fountain pen and piles of enticingly fresh paper at hand and dash off notes expressive of your gratitude at being remembered your delight in new possessions and your overflowing warmth toward those who took so much care on your behalf it also gives christmas dinner a chance to settle miss manners is hearing some murmurs from the crowd perhaps there are questions concerning this simple and rewarding task yes you there holding the ah what is that thing anyway exactly you reply what about something i hate do i still have to write a thank-you note and if so what can i possibly say miss manners should not have to point out that it is just as much trouble to select a useless ugly object as it is a treasure it is therefore necessary for the unlucky recipient to render thanks for an unwelcome present as much as for a welcome one but as the giver obviously did not know how useless and ugly the stupid thing was the goal of the thank-you letter is to avoid enlightening him or her on this point it should therefore be indistinguishable from one written out of genuine appreciation how can i do that without lying miss manners wishes that just once in a while she would hear such declarations of devotion to honesty when it is not a question of getting out of a task or delivering an insult there should be no trouble about saying honestly how grateful you were to be remembered since a thank-you letter must also contain something about the present miss manners recommends to the morally fastidious the words wonderful terrific and awesome a ghastly present can easily be any one of these as your dictionary will confirm do i have to write to people i thanked in person only for extraordinary presents an oral gee i really liked the car is not enough a written document after a personal exchange of fruitcakes is too much can i save time by doing my thank-you letters on the computer do you suppose that your grandparents don't recognize an all-purpose computer paragraph when they see one thank-you letters must be handwritten miss manners does give special dispensation to those for whom that is a hardship if the writing hand is arthritic for example but will no longer tolerate abuses of this indulgence from those who are too lazy to write legibly can i fax it yes provided that you are not violating the rule against using office equipment for personal business miss manners is not unreasonable she likes toys as much as the next person who tries to dignify them under the name of technology dear miss manners should signet and monogram rings be worn so that the crest and initials face the person wearing the ring or in the opposite direction so that the face of the ring is upright for an observer gentle reader miss manners hopes you do not fancy that such a ring has the same purpose as a designer label explaining the provenance of the body wearing it as it is not intended to be read by appraisers it is not worn to face the public
