steven spielberg describes his latest blockbuster film jurassic park which opened in the us last night as not science fiction but science eventuality the hollywood publicity machine has made sure that most americans already know its plot scientists use genetic engineering to create a theme park with real dinosaurs which then run amok this week with a sense of timing that the best hollywood hype merchant could not have matched the venerable british research journal nature published evidence suggesting that the movie is slightly less far-fetched than it may sound a californian research group including dr george poinar a scientific adviser to jurassic park has extracted the first samples of genetic material dna from the dinosaur era admittedly the 120m-year-old dna came from an extinct weevil rather than a dinosaur and the californian scientists isolated just fragments of two genes rather than the 100,000 or so complete genes that would provide full instructions for anyone wanting to recreate the insect but they have demonstrated two propositions that would have seemed wildly speculative less than 10 years ago first the dna molecule is robust enough to survive for millions of years under the right conditions second scientists can fish out microscopic quantities of dna and then make billions of copies for analysis using gene-amplifying technology called polymerase chain reaction the link between jurassic park and the poinar group's real-life discovery is amber fossilised tree resin which has unique sealing and antiseptic properties it is a honey-coloured time capsule transporting trapped insects virtually intact from prehistoric forest to laboratory bench the californian scientists worked on a tree-feeding weevil preserved in amber from jezzine lebanon michael crichton who wrote the novel jurassic park imagined extracting dna from blood in the gut of a mosquito that had fed on a dinosaur just before it was trapped in the resin unfortunately for the story the vast majority of insects in amber are species that live or feed on trees such as weevils termites ants and bees only a handful of specimens of blood-sucking insects are known from the dinosaur era older than 65 m years and scientists will be fantastically lucky if they contain dinosaur dna that had not been broken down by digestive juices the greatest possible piece of luck would be to find a recently hatched baby dinosaur in amber extremely unlikely but not out of the question after all lizards and frogs have been preserved in 40m-year-old amber from the dominican republic however amber is not the only potential source of dinosaur dna in exceptional cases the molecules may be robust enough to survive inside dinosaur fossils professor jack horner of montana state university is attempting to find genetic material in bones of the ferocious tyrannosaurus rex which have been preserved in extremely dry sandstone beds even if scientists do manage to extract dinosaur dna from any source it is hard to see how this could include the whole genome the blueprint that would be the first requirement for resurrecting dinosaurs for the foreseeable future any mad billionaire who really wants to create a jurassic park would do better to forget genes and build on the technique mr spielberg used for his movie computer-controlled robotic dinosaurs over the next decade or two artificial intelligence and bio-materials engineering will advance to the point at which it would be possible to create a lifelike tyrannosaurus rex that behaved with terrifying unpredictability for the palaeogeneticist studying ancient dna the ultimate objective is not to recreate any species insect or dinosaur the point is first to track evolution at the molecular level by following genetic changes over millions of years the research may also reveal facts about an extinct creature and its lifestyle that are impossible to discover from conventional fossils knowledge of a few intact genes from dinosaurs could answer many controversial questions about their evolution and relationship to today's reptiles birds and mammals and discovering a gene for a digestive enzyme for example would be a strong clue about what a particular dinosaur ate although recreating a whole dinosaur is out of the question anyone who isolated an individual gene would find it relatively easy to insert this into today's living creatures employing methods already used routinely to transfer genes between species human genes for instance have been inserted into sheep so that the human proteins required for medical purposes can be extracted from the animals milk if scientists managed to isolate one dinosaur gene and insert it into a crocodile embryo the creature would still grow up looking and behaving like a croc because its development would be controlled by thousands of its own genes but it might produce some dinosaur protein an enterprising company could make a fortune breeding and promoting the resulting crocodiles even if just a millionth of their genetic material came from a dinosaur imagine florida restaurants serving crocodine steaks or tokyo department stores selling dinocroc shoes and handbags biotechnologists who are already nervous about the likely impact of jurassic park on public attitudes to genetic engineering dislike such speculation but it is a plausible scenario 20 years from now mr spielberg's eventuality is unlikely to come to pass for 100 years if at all
