A research facility where trainees will be taught to untangle traffic problems has been opened at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo . Growing counties , including Ventura County , will soon be beset with such typical urban problems as traffic congestion , said Steve Hockaday , director of the $ 500,000 traffic research program devised by the California Department of Transportation , California Highway Patrol and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo . The research facility simulates the Los Angeles Traffic Operations Center , a control tower in which workers gather information from the roadways and then direct police , tow trucks and emergency vehicles to clear up traffic jams . `` Caltrans and the CHP will be building a number of centers like the one in L.A. throughout the state , '' Hockaday said . `` This research facility will be used as a training ground and as a way to test out new techniques . '' A computer wall display will show a representation of roadway conditions , traffic flow , simulated accidents , rush-hour traffic jams and other problems . Trainees will phone in instructions , providing realistic practice in dealing with traffic jams , Hockaday said . MAJA RADEVICH
