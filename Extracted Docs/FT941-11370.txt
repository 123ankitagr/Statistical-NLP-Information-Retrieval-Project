german money supply rose at an unexpectedly high rate in december as large inflows of cash from outside the country were accompanied by a surge in domestic lending the bundesbank said yesterday the announcement jolted the bond market and reduced hopes that the german central bank would soon move to reduce the discount and lombard rates they have stood at 5.75 and 6.75 per cent since last october financial markets were prepared for a high figure but the 8.1 per cent increase in m3 was much greater than expected m3 measures broad money on which the bundesbank relies for its estimates of inflationary developments the figure was considerably higher than the 7.2 per cent growth in november and well above the 4.5 6.5 per cent growth target for last year yesterday's figures mean m3 growth on an annualised seasonally adjusted basis has exceeded the target range for three successive years there was further disappointment that the bundesbank did not cut interest rates after yesterday's meeting of its policymaking council and there was a strong sell-off in the bond market yields on five-year government bonds climbed by 6 basis points to 5.17 per cent mr peter lang economist at bayerische vereinsbank in munich said the m3 growth would reinforce the bundesbank's caution in bringing down interest rates but another economist playing down the figures said what the bundesbank really looks at is inflation and that is coming down sharply the bundesbank said the exceptional factors which had led to the sharp rise in december had already been partly reversed in january it blamed what it called the extraordinarily high increase in m3 on two chief factors a surge in domestic bank lending and the influx of dm59 2 bn dollars 34.2 bn into the banking system in december the capital influx exceeded that of september 1992, when dm42 7 bn flowed into germany amid currency market turmoil the bundesbank said this movement was attributable to tax changes which made it attractive for individuals to repatriate investments from luxembourg coupled with the impact of the repatriation of corporate deposits from the euromarket domestic lending rose 10.3 per cent due mainly to a surge in mortgage borrowing economists said the bundesbank's decision not to cut rates was also conditioned by a bout of sabre-rattling in the dispute over pay for metalworkers see lex bonds page 27 currencies page 29 world stocks page 35
