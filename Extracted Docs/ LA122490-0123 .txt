Actor Tom Hanks says charges of racism in `` The Bonfire of the Vanities '' may be misdirected because the movie hits rich , white people most of all . `` I did n't worry much about the racist angle , '' he said . `` The story is hard on everybody , probably hardest of all on the white Park Avenue types . '' Director Brian DePalma ran into considerable community opposition while making the movie , particularly from blacks . In an interview published Sunday in The Tennessean , Hanks said he was `` bracing to hear from the Southern belle lobbyists . My mistress in the movie is not a very flattering example of Southern womanhood . '' The star of `` Splash , '' `` Dragnet '' and `` Big '' said that the offer from DePalma to play selfish yuppie Sherman McCoy came as a surprise and that he thought the offer was a joke .
