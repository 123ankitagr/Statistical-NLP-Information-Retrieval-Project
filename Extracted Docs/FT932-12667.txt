SEIBU , the Japanese department store group , announced yesterday that sales had fallen below those of Mitsukoshi , its main rival , for the first time in five years . Seibu , which is privately owned , took the unprecedented step of publishing a financial report . It announced it had made its first ever pre-tax unconsolidated loss in the year to end-February . It was the first loss at the group since its founding in 1940 . The loss was mainly due to a scandal involving medical equipment , which forced Seibu into an extraordinary loss of Y19.7bn ( Dollars 175m ) . It covered the loss by selling Y35bn worth of fixed assets . Sales were 12.3 per cent down from the previous year at Y790.1bn . Operating profits were Y7.6bn and the pre-tax loss came to Y10.4bn .
