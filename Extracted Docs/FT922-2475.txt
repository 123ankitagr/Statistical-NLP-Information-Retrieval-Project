Do good personnel policies contribute to corporate profitability ? Can human resource management specialists add value in the same way that their colleagues in production , sales or finance do ? This is the Holy Grail of personnel management and researchers from Lancaster University and the University of Wales claim to have found it . Looking at the performance of 60 UK manufacturing companies ( mainly in engineering and electronics ) over 10 years , the researchers found that those with more sophisticated human resource management systems had better return on capital . 'Before this research , many companies were believed to benefit from good human resource policies but it was difficult to assess the impact , ' said Steve Fox of Lancaster University Management School . Now , for the first time , claims Fox , an 'association ' between policy and profit has been established . The researchers took five personnel functions - recruitment and selection , management education , performance appraisal , reward and remuneration and company career planning - and looked at four measures of how they were practiced . The four measures were : how systematically were they conducted ; how well integrated with each other ; how well integrated with corporate strategy and how meritocratically applied . They found that financially successful companies fared above average on all four measures . A particularly strong relationship was found between financial success and the integration of personnel policies with corporate strategy . Is this really a first ? Fox says there have been many individual company case studies but no studies that look so systematically at so many companies . More fundamentally , is the whole project based on a tautology ? Well-run companies are generally more successful than badly-run companies and well-run companies are likely to have well-run human resource management policies too .
