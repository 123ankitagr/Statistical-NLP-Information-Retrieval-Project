women will have to wait longer before they can receive a state pension if the government accepts recent proposals the social security advisory committee dropped a bombshell when in evidence to the government's inquiry into the equalisation of state pension ages it re-commended that women receive the state pension at age 65, the present age for men instead of at 60 the committee admitted that its reasons were financial the estimated pounds 3 bn saved each year by making women wait for their pension could be spent on raising the social security benefits paid to the poorer sections of the community it is a solution which accepts that the resources available for social security are finite one lesson from the last general election was that while people supported the proposals for higher benefits they were not prepared to pay for them through higher taxes or higher national insurance contributions but pensions and retirement are not related solely to financial considerations employment policy and social trends also have an impact on attitudes over the past decade men have been ceasing work well before state pension age the 1991 labour-force survey published in the employment gazette of april 1992, showed that more men are stopping working before age 65, even though they do not receive a retirement pension from the state until they reach age 65 there are two main reasons for this employers when reducing their workforce have tended to make older employees redundant while many employees want to cease working before age 65, either because they have had enough of work or because they want to do something different while they are still young enough the present employment pattern is different among women the number working beyond age 60 is comparatively small but it is growing the department of employment does not expect these numbers to increase significantly but its predictions are based on the present pension ages taken together the figures show that only two out of three people are working beyond age 55, so that one may safely assume that large numbers of men and women will cease work well before reaching 65 although mr peter lilley the social security secretary has given no indication of the government's likely action it is expected that it will raise the women's pension age to 65, with a suitable run-in period despite the trend towards earlier retirement if this does happen what can employees both men and women do to ensure that they have an income if they cease work before age 65 there are two courses the first and more practical is to look to the private sector either through an occupational pension scheme or by making arrangements for a personal pension many occupations such as banking insurance and the civil service have traditionally retired their employees at 60 several other schemes now have a common pension age below 65 for both sexes where such schemes integrate their benefits with the state basic pension it is common for them to pay men an additional bridging pension from retirement until age 65, to replace the single person's state pension so if the government does equalise at age 65, occupational schemes with integrated benefits will be under pressure to pay bridging pensions to both men and women until age 65 however the latest survey from the national association of pension funds shows that more occupational schemes are setting their common pension age at 65 these could come under pressure from employees to provide generous early-retirement benefits together with bridging pensions employees in occupational schemes would need to consider making further savings provision themselves such as additional voluntary contributions avcs and personal equity plans peps a move to equalise pension ages at 65 would send a signal to employees who are not in occupational schemes that they cannot rely on the state for their pension if they stop working early they would need to make their own provision through personal pensions which allow individuals to take benefits from age 50 however employees will need to make substantial contributions in order to secure worthwhile early-retirement pensions because there will be less time to build up a substantial fund and annuity rates are lower at an early age the second approach favoured by many in the pensions industry is to press for a system of flexible retirement that is employees would be able to retire at a convenient time over a period such as between ages 60 and 70 this looks attractive on paper but there are a number of flaws such as who would decide when the time is convenient the employee or the employer so long as entitlement to the state pension depends only on employees reaching a certain age not on whether they have ceased work most will take the pension at the earliest possible age even though they may still be working employees can currently defer taking the state pension for up to five years receiving an enhancement when it is eventually taken few take up this option even when they continue working and this would be likely to happen with a flexible pension age thereby negating any flexibility unless entitlement to the pension also required employees to cease paid employment how many are still working 1992 000 s men women ages 55-59 60-64 65-69 55-59 60-64 65 employed 1,136 720
