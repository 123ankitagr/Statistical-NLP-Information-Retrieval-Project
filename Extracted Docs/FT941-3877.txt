According to Ms Alison Cottrell of Midland Global Markets Research , investors ' disappointment with the meagre 3 basis point cut in the repo rate last week was a 'triumph of imagination over experience ' . She points out that the Bundesbank rarely cuts the repo rate by 10 points or more without following up with a cut in the discount rate . This is currently unlikely , she says , in the aftermath of embarrassingly high growth in M3 money supply in January ( the annualised , seasonally adjusted growth rate was revised up from 20.6 per cent to 21.2 per cent on Friday ) , however strong the fundamentals in terms of easing inflationary pressures . Thus this Thursday 's meeting of the Bundesbank 's policy-making council is not tipped to cut the discount rate from its current level of 5.25 per cent . The central bank may take the opportunity to announce a fixed rate tender for next week , thereby ushering money market rates down further , but the best that can be hoped for this week is a further minuscule cut in the repo rate after another variable rate tender . The market will also reflect on the outcome of yesterday 's elections in the state of Lower Saxony and the impact of last Friday 's pay settlement for public sector workers .
