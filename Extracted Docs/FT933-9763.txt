midnight in manhattan in a basement club in the heart of america's most sophisticated metropolis couples in cowboy hats and boots are strutting to country dances with hick-sounding names like the texas two-step honky tonk stomp and boot-scootin' boogie a glittering cowboy saddle plated with mirrored glass revolves from the ceiling other icons of the american west are scattered throughout the hall painted wagon wheels cacti stuffed animal heads while television sets show black-and-white film of hollywood cowboy stars riding into last chance gulch suddenly the dancers form in rows for one of the popular new country line dances a few steps to the left a few to the right and then a corkscrewing leg kick it looks a little like a slow-motion aerobics class performed in western fancy dress this is denim diamonds a nightclub which opened recently within tobacco-spitting distance of the waldorf-astoria hotel bringing a national boom in country music and dancing into the centre of culturally sniffy new york city country music's revenue share of us record sales soared from 8.8 per cent in 1990 to 16.5 per cent in 1992 and singer garth brooks the biggest phenomenon to hit country music in decades was america's top-selling record artist in any category last year more than 2,600 radio stations a quarter of the us total now feature country music boosters in nashville tennessee the centre of the industry claim it is the most popular radio format in 57 of america's top 100 cities many of them outside country's traditional base in the south and west now nashville is hoping to conquer the rest of the world japan which watches american fashions closely already has its first all-country radio station and country music television cmt a cable channel showing non-stop country music videos began transmissions in britain and other european countries last autumn turning europe on will not be easy though in the uk for example country has a thoroughly negative image as middle-of-the road music with corny lyrics about irrelevant rural americana performed by rhinestone-encrusted hayseeds with funny names funny accents and even more risible hairstyles candidly i don't think you can just dump a wheelbarrow full of big cowboy hats and belt buckles in the centre of europe and start a trend says roy wunsch who heads sony music's nashville operation the industry he suggests will have to exercise a degree of subtlety as it introduces artists to the continent yet europe's image of country is seriously out of date the music has changed much over the past few years which helps explain why it is enjoying such a boom in the us and why it could conceivably appeal to a wider european audience nashville has discovered a new generation of young sexy-looking musicians who are singing songs with broader appeal than in the past and who can be marketed nationally using a powerful new medium cable television the nashville network tv channel was dismissed as a sure-fire failure by much of the entertainment industry when it started 10 years ago but it is now one of the most popular us cable outlets with programmes that cover not just music but other aspects of life dear to the country-loving american country-style cooking motor mechanics bass fishing drag racing hunting trucking and rodeo its sister network country music television is one of the fastest-growing us networks pumping out non-stop videos of the latest country hits another reason for the music's success seems to be the sheer weakness and fractured nature of other pop formats many americans find it hard to relate to the rap music of the black ghettoes the uncompromising neo-punk sounds of grunge rock or the tired themes of heavy metal ageing baby-boomers who like their music tuneful and none too rebellious find some of the modern country sounds reassuringly similar to the country-rock and folk rock performed in the late 1960 s and early 1970 s by groups such as the band and the eagles around nashville enthusiasts like to quote a remark attributed possibly apocryphally to the british pop star elton john rock n roll hasn't died it's just gone country that is an exaggeration although rock n roll did itself spring partly from country roots elvis presley began as a country singer and is still claimed as such somewhat cheekily by the nashville establishment presley's genius was to fuse white country sounds with the black rhythm and blues of the mississippi delta often called white man's blues country music can trace its origins to the poor small-holders many from the scots-english border country who settled the southern appalachian mountains in the 18 th century bringing with them a tradition of folk ballads which became entwined with other eclectic musical elements the music became commercialised in the 1920 s when radio stations began springing up across the us some of them featuring country songs the most important for the development of the music was nashville's station wsm its weekly show the grand ole opry played a seminal part in developing country artists the opry is still going and its folksy old-fashioned shows have become a much revered institution in nashville but its role as a trend-setter has long since been usurped by radio stations focusing on top country hits and latterly by television after a succession of booms in the 1950 s and 1960 s country music became stuck in a rut in the early 1980 s and faced plummeting record sales it was dominated by middle-aged stars with a penchant for elaborate costumes often dripping with jewellery it costs a lot to make a person look this cheap quipped a sequin-covered dolly parton at a recent new york concert and old-fashioned high-piled hairstyles the higher the hair the closer to god ran one nashville joke the music they performed was equally full of artifice relying heavily on massed strings synthesisers syrupy vocal choruses and excessive use of the steel guitar the instrument which gives country a soaring hawaiian-style sound then around the middle of the decade salvation arrived in the form of fresh young singers calling themselves new traditionalists they rejected slickness in favour of a much simpler more traditional sound emphasising fiddles guitars and a single voice an important early example was storms of life the 1986 debut album by randy travis whose looks were as four-square and clean-cut as his singing and whose record sold surprisingly well nashville scoured the south for similar acts and has ended up with a roster of virile-looking men known collectively as the new country hunks who tend to dress in plain but figure-hugging blue jeans and wear cowboy hats hence their other nickname hat acts some of their names as much as their chiselled profiles could have been plucked from the pages of romantic fiction dwight yoakum clint black billy ray cyrus but the most popular of all is brooks a man of rather pudgy boy-next-door good looks who more than any country singer since presley has managed to achieve what every artist prays for cross-over' status this is industry jargon for someone who appeals to a much wider audience than traditional country fans and whose records are hits on the regular pop charts as well as the ones restricted to country music to cross over is to earn very big bucks brooks is so popular because he sings strongly melodic tunes with original lyrics and delivers the package with great intensity his musical influences go well beyond the traditional country roster to include james taylor the melancholic folk singer popular in the early 1970 s and elton john in subject matter too brooks songs break new ground for country music which used to focus on a few narrow themes revolving mainly around the hard times and love life of the macho white southern male of rural working-class origins known as a redneck or good ol boy in traditional songs his woman has left him or fails to reciprocate his passion and he seeks escape from this tribulation by drinking beer six packs in a bar honky tonk driving around in a pick-up truck the ford remembering the salt-of-the earth goodness of his parents maw n paw praying to god the gewd lawd or thanking his lucky stars that he was born in the south dixie many of brooks songs also deal with these cliches although he handles them freshly but he also sings about such delicate contemporary issues as date rape and wife battering and in we shall be free he makes an appeal for racial sexual and religious tolerance which contrasts sharply with the south's reputation for bigotry long-time nashville song-writer richard leigh who wrote the 1977 cross-over hit don't it make my brown eyes blue says there is an urban discovery of country music going on so you cannot just sing about chickens and pick-up trucks because that is not exactly within the experience of a wide variety of people we are not an agrarian society any more yet nashville's much-vaunted new openness is still pretty limited take what happened to the talented singer k d lang who had an impeccable background for a country artist she grew up in the rural prairieland of canada then tried to make a name for herself in nashville the industry cold-shouldered her partly because of her lesbianism and partly because as a vegetarian she made a television commercial attacking the beef industry an impolitic move given the strong links between country music and cattle farming she in turn transformed herself from a country artist into a more sophisticated mainstream performer as have some other male artists but for every garth brooks there are a dozen or so nashville singers making records with strongly traditional themes an example is joe diffie a leading performer of cry in your beer honky tonk rock his latest album includes songs such as i can walk the line if it ain't too straight an appeal for his nagging woman to give him some slack from domestic constraints many country songs remain cloyingly sentimental and deeply religious and there is a sizeable streak of kitsch at the heart of the industry while country has changed its new face might still be too parochially middle american for most european tastes the good ol boys may have moved from mama's farm to suburbia but they have taken a lot of down-home sentiments with them while this baggage gives country its sense of individuality and history it also circumscribes its development
