as christmas approaches the bundesbank is making those who analyse its every action wait a little before they can relax into festive mood first they will have to digest all the german central bank has to offer this week in the way of economic analysis monetary performance and policy targets among economists a debate is raging as to whether the german central bank will start raising official interest rates soon wait until late next year or beyond or manage one more reduction in the present economic cycle they are hoping for clues when the bundesbank announces its 1995 money supply target on thursday most economists expect gradual rises in rates from the second half of next year a cut at this stage would unsettle bond markets yesterday the bank offered some seasonal cheer with its monthly report this highlighted the strength of the economic upturn welcomed the fall in the public sector deficit expected to decrease by some dm20bn pounds 81bn this year to around dm115bn and said west german inflation could decline to below 25 per cent early next year figures are also expected shortly showing that growth in m3 the broad monetary aggregate eased further to an annualised rate of just over 6 per cent in november this would still leave m3 slightly above the 1994 target range of between 4 and 6 per cent but mark the continuation of a huge improvement on the overblown growth rates in the first half of the year at thursdays meeting therefore the consensus is that the target level for 1995 will be roughly the same but beyond that economists opinions diverge sharply the bundesbank has calmed markets by holding open all possibilities the hope that something could come in the way of rate cuts has never been taken from the market noted mr hermann remsperger chief economist at bhfbank in frankfurt the last reduction in official rates was in may when the discount and lombard rates were cut by half a percentage point each to 45 and 6 per cent respectively then the aim was to slow the alarming acceleration in m3 growth by encouraging investors to move funds from shortterm deposits to longer term instruments looking back on 1994 added mr remsperger i would say the bundesbanks experiment of using rate cuts to brake money supply growth has succeeded ms alison cottrell londonbased economist at kidder peabody of the us also believes the bundesbank is trying to keep markets happy they want to keep the hope of rate cuts alive all the time thats the reason theyre not cutting nor does she see any pressing reason for further reductions now she expects renewed tightening in late summer or autumn next year neither she nor mr remsperger totally exclude the possibility of a cut early next year though among those arguing strongly for such a move is dresdner bank there remains a good chance that the bundesbank will cut the discount rate once again the banks research arm said admitting its view was controversial it cited the improving monetary and inflation situation including the prospect of moderate wage deals taking the opposite view is goldman sachs the us investment bank its frankfurtbased economists have criticised the bundesbanks rate cuts and what they call its liberal interpretation of the monetary target in 1994 thus they see the need for a moderate increase in official interest rates in the course of 1995 mr remsperger sees the truth as lying someway between the two for him the importance of thursdays meeting will be more in what the bundesbank says about m3 performance and targets than in the actual figures an unchanged m3 goal will send the message that the bundesbank takes account of the overshooting of the target and intends to correct this although the link between m3 and future inflation is not always clear some economists feel the bundesbank should tighten policy early as a precaution against any speeding up of inflation in 1996 mr martin hufner economist at bayerische vereinsbank says interest rates should go up in the first half of 1995 for ms cottrell however it will be fiscal policy that determines when and if rates rise next year if both the consolidation of the federal budget and wage trends look like getting out of hand she thinks the bundesbank could use interest rate rises as a psychological tool to knock sense into politicians and wage bargainers undoubtedly the central bank continues to take m3 seriously despite criticism from those who feel it has wavered from the true monetary path thus the bundesbank is likely to underscore its commitment to monetary targeting when it sets its 1995 range for m3 on thursday then the christmas celebrations can begin editorial comment page 15
