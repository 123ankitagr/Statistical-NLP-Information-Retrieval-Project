More than 40 pilot whales have died near New Zealand 's Coromandel Peninsula over the past few days after beaching themselves , officials said Wednesday . Volunteers and conservation officers managed to coax many of the whales back to sea , but some returned to the peninsula on the east coast of New Zealand 's North Island or were too exhausted to survive .
