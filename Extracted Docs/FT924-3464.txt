CONSULTATIONS have been initiated to establish the extent of the changes needed to provide improved protection for the 5m participants in personal-pension schemes , Miss Ann Widdecombe , junior pensions minister , told the Commons last night . She said she had recently met Lautro ( the unit trust and life assurance regulator ) Imro ( the investment managers ' regulator ) , the Securities and Investments Board , and Fimbra ( the regulator of independent financial advisers ) to discuss 'what may or may not be going wrong ' . Miss Widdecombe again insisted that personal-pension schemes were 'an undoubted success ' , and said she did not want to give the impression that the government had been inundated with complaints of malpractice or inefficiency . Mrs Llin Golding , shadow pensions minister , withdrew a Labour amendment to the Social Security Bill which would have introduced a strengthened regulatory system requiring personal-pension schemes to guarantee a minimum level of benefit . Miss Widdecombe maintained it would be rash to rush into an entirely new regime . The first task , she said , was to establish 'the extent of the problem , its nature and whether or not looking at existing regimes of control , and perhaps other issues , would result in a sufficient tightening-up ' . Miss Widdecombe emphasised that nearly 70 per cent of those who retired had occupational pensions , whose average value was nearly as great as the state pension .
