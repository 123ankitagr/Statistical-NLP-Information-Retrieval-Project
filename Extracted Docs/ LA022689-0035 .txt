many thanks to bob sipchen for his article on those of us who still wear our mia bracelets a reminder of vietnam feb 13 it was very encouraging to learn that i was not the only one still wearing mine mine says pfc timothy owen 62968 i have worn this bracelet for him since august 1968 it never fails to cause wistful comment wherever i go and to all those who ask why i still wear it i patiently explain that he is one of those 2500 still listed as missing and that i will wear it for him until they find him period no i do not know him personally i have had to have it welded back together when it snapped in two from wear and i have had to have it coated with silver when it turned black from exposure but wear it i will until he comes back as an american it is the least of what i owe him melody suppes palos verdes
