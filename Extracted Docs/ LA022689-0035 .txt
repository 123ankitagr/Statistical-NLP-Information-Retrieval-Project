Many thanks to Bob Sipchen for his article on those of us who still wear our MIA bracelets ( `` A Reminder of Vietnam . . . , '' Feb. 13 ) . It was very encouraging to learn that I was not the only one still wearing mine . Mine says `` PFC TIMOTHY OWEN , 6/29/68 . '' I have worn this bracelet for him since August , 1968 . It never fails to cause wistful comment wherever I go . And to all those who ask why I still wear it , I patiently explain that he is one of those 2,500 still listed as missing , and that I will wear it for him until they find him . Period . ( No , I do not know him personally . ) I have had to have it welded back together when it snapped in two from wear , and I have had to have it coated with silver when it turned black from exposure . But wear it I will until he comes back . As an American , it is the least of what I owe him . MELODY SUPPES Palos Verdes
