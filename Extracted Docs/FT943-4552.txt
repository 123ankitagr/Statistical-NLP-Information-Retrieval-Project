It will be long before many Americans turn on their personal computers instead of motoring down to the mall for their shopping . But Home Shopping Network 's acquisition of the Internet Shopping Network brings that day somewhat closer . Until now , most companies retailing goods over the Internet -including ISN itself - have been small start-up ventures . HSN , which owns the US 's largest cable tv shopping channel , has the financial firepower to develop computer shopping . It also brings established relationships with a multitude of manufacturers and retailers . In the longer term , TV and computer shopping should merge . With the advent of cable modems , ordinary TV sets will become interactive . People will no longer sit passively as goods are paraded in front of them and then place orders over the telephone . Instead , they will be able to search for items and buy them with the press of a button . Similarly , computer shopping - which still consists mainly of scrolling through text listings - will increasingly be enlivened by moving pictures . HSN may have gained something of a head-start by acquiring ISN , but the field promises to be crowded . Computer groups such as Microsoft , telecommunications operators and rival cable shopping channels such as QVC are all eyeing the opportunities .
