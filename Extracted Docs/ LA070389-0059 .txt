in a oneshot effort to sell tickets during the summer doldrums continental airlines on sunday launched what could become a shortterm fare war by dramatically cutting prices on roundtrips beginning later this week the airline will charge a flat roundtrip fare of $ 152 for some seats on nearly all of its 1400 daily flights to qualify for the fare travelers must leave this thursday friday or saturday but they may return any time they like beginning sunday united airlines responded to continentals announcement by saying that it will match the fares in all markets where the two carriers compete other airlines either could not be reached for comment or said they were still considering the fare cuts big savings with the onetime discount a roundtrip flight between los angeles and newark the airport continental serves in the new york metropolitan area will cost roughly half of the lowest maxsaver fares these roundtrip fares normally range from $ 278 to $ 318 depending on when they are scheduled a full unrestricted oneway coach fare between the two cities costs $ 588 continental said a family of four traveling between boston and los angeles would save $ 744 from the lowest fares currently available the fare would be $ 608 instead of $ 1352 for the same travel on a regular discount ticket continental said it is offering the spirit of 76 fares the price will be $ 76 each way partly because it expects business travel to be light this week with the independence day holiday falling on tuesday the airline said it is making more than 200000 seats available at the low fares during the threeday sale period although airlines do not reveal the number of seats allocated to cutrate fares ned walker a continental spokesman estimated that the average flight would carry about 50 passengers on the new low fares thus on a boeing 727 flight for example more than a third of the seats will be allocated to the promotional fares continentals dc9s carry about 100 passengers and its boeing 747s have seats for about 400 passengers unlike the maxsaver fares pioneered by continental in 1987 and matched by all of the other carriers the spirit of 76 fares carry no restrictions though they are not refundable a traveler must make a return trip reservation at the time the ticket is purchased this weekend however for an extra $ 75 for each roundtrip ticket the return travel date may be changed this would make the roundtrip fare $ 227 still lower than the nearest low fare in many cases this may be a move by continental to get the consumer to believe that low fares are not gone forever said paul karos airline analyst with first boston corp a new york brokerage house there will always be promotions like this to fend off the backlash of travelers who are unhappy about higher airline fares karos added that there is clearly elasticity in the industry when it comes to fares as fares go up the number of passengers comes down
