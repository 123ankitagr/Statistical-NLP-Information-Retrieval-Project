Try comparing the carnage in the 1967 James Bond film `` You Only Live Twice '' ( shown on television here last Sunday ) to the latest film ; `` License to Kill '' does n't even come close . Twenty-two years ago the Bond movie included two people eaten alive by piranha , myriad stabbings , shootings and poisonings , a pitched battle with a body count in the hundreds . Protest all you like against the current upswing in movie violence ( like Sheila Benson in her July 23 article , I too found the Joker 's art-museum rampage in `` Batman '' highly objectionable ) , but leave `` Licence to Kill '' out of it ; as these things go , it 's kids stuff .
