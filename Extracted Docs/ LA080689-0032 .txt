try comparing the carnage in the 1967 james bond film you only live twice shown on television here last sunday to the latest film license to kill doesnt even come close twentytwo years ago the bond movie included two people eaten alive by piranha myriad stabbings shootings and poisonings a pitched battle with a body count in the hundreds protest all you like against the current upswing in movie violence like sheila benson in her july 23 article i too found the jokers artmuseum rampage in batman highly objectionable but leave licence to kill out of it as these things go its kids stuff frank lowther los angeles
