ALTHOUGH Caracas had the highest growth of the world 's stock markets last year - 555 per cent in dollar terms , according to the IFC - the Venezuelan stock market still has some serious disadvantages as far as foreign investors are concerned , says the head of a UK regional investment fund . Mr Audley Twiston Davies , chief executive of Latin American Securities , a joint venture between Foreign and Colonial Management and a Brazilian investment bank , said recently that trading in Caracas was restricted , thin and potentially unfair to minority shareholders . During a conference on privatisation held in Caracas , he noted that 'an attractive market ' should be 'efficient , regulated to prevent insider trading , have adequate information available on the market and good liquidity . Venezuela scores rather badly on all those ' . Mr Twiston Davies , whose fund has placed several hundred million dollars on Latin America 's five leading stock markets , also noted that the Caracas exchange 's regulatory body is ineffective , and that a 50 per cent tax on capital gains is too high , especially in comparison with Mexico and Brazil . Venezuela has much to offer foreign investors , he added , but 'the truth must be told about the stock market , even though this may hurt ' . He suggested that privatisation of government-owned companies in Venezuela might broaden the Caracas stock exchange and make it more attractive to foreign investors .
