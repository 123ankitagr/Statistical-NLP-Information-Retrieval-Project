designers of a video-image exhibit of richard m nixon at his planned presidential library say guests will be able to step forward and ask the former president a question or two they hope that those who do will feel as if they have actually talked to the former president with the latest in computer wizardry and more than 400 video clips the questioner will touch a screen and trigger an answer that appears from the former president's lips it's as if by some form of fortune you actually met the president designer alex cranstoun said on tuesday nixon's 77 th birthday officials at the richard m nixon library and birthplace that is under construction here unveiled new architectural drawings and described for the first time their plans to develop disneyland-style high-tech exhibits with the latest in so-called interactive multimedia cranstoun said that the room of world leaders should appear as a cocktail party after a major summit meeting in which visitors can touch a video screen and hear comments from the participants about nixon images of the vietnam war he said will be displayed in an exhibit that duplicates the living room of a 1960 s middle-american home where the war unfolded on television there will also be a room dedicated to the watergate scandal that toppled nixon's presidency it will contain elements from all sides of the issue including a machine that will play excerpts from the famous white house tapes said hugh hewitt director of the library foundation the events of the scandal will be displayed in chronological order starting with the break-in at the democratic headquarters at the watergate hotel and ending with a large photograph of nixon waving from the steps of a helicopter as he left the white house following his resignation we understand the greatest court of public opinion will focus on this room and therefore there is the need for full and fair treatment said hewitt cranstoun who worked on both the johnson and carter presidential libraries as well as the 1992 world fair planned in spain said nixon wanted the library to include a section on watergate he said nixon has not put any restrictions on what it should contain the library will also include a research area for scholars that will contain original documents from before and after nixon's presidency however unlike other presidential libraries that maintain records from the presidential administration the documents from nixon's presidency were turned over to the national archives and records administration by an act of congress privately funded nixon's 20-million library is being completely funded by private contributors more than 15 years after his resignation the ronald reagan presidential library in ventura county is expected to cost at least 40 million in private funds when it opens in february 1991 however taxpayers will foot the 1.5 million cost of maintaining the reagan library the nixon library is scheduled to open july 20 at a ceremony that the former president who now lives in new jersey is expected to attend in addition to the construction of the library the project is also renovating for 400,000, the yorba linda home in which nixon was born the nixon library tour will begin with a 16-minute movie that is entitled at least for now comeback the movie will track nixon's career from his congressional race in 1942 through the present the largest exhibit space in the library will be dedicated to foreign affairs and nixon's meetings with world leaders in one room the life-size images of 10 foreign leaders will appear to be engaged in casual conversation cranstoun said the leaders will include charles de gaulle winston churchill anwar sadat golda meir zhou en-lai mao zedong nikita khrushchev and leonid brezhnev a computer touchscreen will display profile information about each leader and comments they made about nixon like the other eight presidential libraries in existence nixon's will display many of the gifts he received from celebrities and world leaders the collection includes a vessel with the first oil drawn from a well in saudi arabia a set of guns from elvis presley and the original copy of irving berlin's god bless america visitors are excited the entourage of people attending tuesday's press tour included a few old friends of the former president as well as yorba linda city council members celebrating nixon's birthday for the first time as a legal city holiday this is going to be a marvelous facility councilman henry w wedaa who first proposed the holiday last summer said during the tour look at the quality that is going into the construction you don't see anything cheap going into this facility mayor gene wisner who delivered welcoming remarks to the media said he was surprised at how much larger the library building was than he had imagined and it's built to last 1,000 years wisner said for roland e bigonger a yorba linda councilman the library tour was a unique opportunity bigonger had been chairman of the original six-member committee that was formed in 1968 to preserve nixon's birthplace until the nixon foundation was formed a few years ago the committee raised its own funds to keep up the place and its members even took it upon themselves to pick weeds at the old property now as part of the library project the nixon foundation is spending about 400,000 to shore up the wood-frame house for public viewing this means the completion of a dream bigonger said although library designers acknowledged that the public's greatest interest no doubt would be in the watergate exhibits a longtime nixon friend don bendetti 61, of laguna beach said the former president distinguished himself in foreign policy affairs he ended the vietnam war and he opened relations with china said bendetti a developer who has helped oversee the library's construction this library will accentuate the good deeds and the good things he did in his administration another nixon friend jack drown 70, a retired magazine distributor from rolling hills said i think the library has been a long time in coming but it's going to happen and we're all excited
