your editorial calling for wright to resign puzzles me the charges presented so far are by admission of the ethics committee based on suspicion not hard evidence if the evidence is produced then he should resign what puzzles me is that there is now emerging from the north trial evidence that both ronald reagan and george bush were involved in the illegal activities and were impeachable the information emerging is far more credible at this point than the charges against wright so why arent you calling for bush to resign is it hypocrisy charles christian santa barbara
