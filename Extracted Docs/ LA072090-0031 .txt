richard m nixon dedicated his presidential library thursday to the ringing applause of his three republican successors and 50000 spectators proclaiming his belief in the american dream but not mentioning the watergate scandal that drove him from office 16 years ago three brass bands played redsuited trumpeters heralded the arrival of the presidents and organizers sent red white and blue balloons aloft at the end of the 2 12hour ceremony nothing we have ever seen matches this moment to be welcomed home again nixon said as he did in his latest book in the arena he spoke about the theme of struggle and the role it has played in his life from his childhood in yorba linda to his political victories and tragedies i believe in the american dream because i have seen it come true in my own life he said you will suffer disappointments in your life and sometimes you will be discouraged it is sad to lose he continued but the greatest sadness is to travel through life without knowing either victory or defeat the gathering on the openair stage marked the first conclave of four presidents in nine years and the first time ever that four american presidents attended a public event president bush and nixon were joined by gerald r ford nixons successor and ronald reagan bushs predecessor each man was accompanied by his wife only democrat jimmy carter did not attend citing a prior commitment seated in the sweltering audience were a whos who of the nixon years and later republican administrations including four former secretaries of state henry kissinger william rogers george p

president spoke but only bush said the w word watergate he told the crowd that museumgoers will hear of horatio alger and alger hiss of nixons book six crises and the seventh crisis watergate bush was among those who broke with nixons defenders in the last days of the nixon presidency after the revelation of the final smoking gun tape showing that nixon had tried to use the cia to block the fbis investigation of watergate bush handdelivered a letter to the white house saying i would now illserve a president whose massive accomplishments i will always respect and whose family i love if i did not give you my judgment resignation is best for this country best for this president it was the same tape that virtually assured that the house of representatives would vote for impeachment two days later nixon became the first president to resign on feb 29 1974 nixon was named an unindicted coconspirator in a sealed indictment by the special watergate grand jury the news did not become public until june of that year thursdays library dedication was widely viewed as a milestone in nixons political rehabilitation the $ 21million presidential library the first in california is next door to the simple wooden farmhouse his father built from a kit several years before nixon was born in 1913 bush hailed nixon as the quintessence of middle america a man who spoke loudly and eloquently for the silent majority from dallas to davenport syracuse to silver city bush recalled the highlights of nixons presidency citing his trip to china ending more than two decades of uschina bitterness and his peace efforts in the middle east he added who can forget how in moscow richard nixon signed the first agreement to limit strategic nuclear arms giving new hope to the world for a lasting peace

nixon most for dedicating his life to the greatest cause offered any president the cause of peace among nations reagan joked about nixons rocky relationship with the media much has been written and said about richard nixon some of it has even been true he said it will come as no surprise to anyone here that there will always be a good deal of debate about richard nixon reagan said generally speaking people in public life who take bold steps who make tough decisions and who show great courage generate controversy reagan called nixon a patriot and praised his contributions in foreign policy richard nixon is a man who understands the world reagan said a man whose foreign policy was universally acknowledged as brilliant i dont think its an exaggeration to say the world is a better place a safer place because of richard nixon ford recalled going to congress for the first time in 1949 and meeting nixon who had been elected two years earlier to the lower house but was already renowned as the nemesis of alger hiss the alleged state department spy for the soviet union who was convicted of perjury the hiss case started nixons quick rise to power which saw him become a us senator in 1950 and vice president in 1952 referring to the wave of democracy sweeping across eastern europe ford credited the four presidents and the american people but especially nixon william e simon nixons former treasury secretary and president of the library foundation spoke most bluntly about nixons decadeslong battles with the news media simon said nixons accomplishments came despite the unrelenting hostility of the national media the four presidents toured the house where nixon was born and which has been restored and given a brandnew look it contains the piano he played and the bed in which he was born the four also toured the museum the only presidential museum financed and operated entirely by private funds police and library officials said the crowd of 50000 included
