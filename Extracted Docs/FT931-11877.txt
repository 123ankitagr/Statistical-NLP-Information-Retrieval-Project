BRITAIN could become the only European country without government cover for export risk unless ministers rethink their plans , Mr Robin Cook , shadow trade and industry secretary , warned yesterday , Alison Smith writes . In a letter to Mr Michael Heseltine , the trade and industry secretary , Mr Cook emphasised the difficulties experienced by the commercial insurance market since the Export Credits Guarantee Department was partly privatised . There was , he said , 'broad agreement that there is not the capacity to provide export reinsurance , particularly for political risk ' . His warning follows last week 's figures showing the trade deficit had reached its highest monthly level for 2 1/2 years , and Mr John Major's appeal to exporters to play a leading role in bringing about economic recovery . Government reinsurance for political risk is due to be discontinued in 1994 .
