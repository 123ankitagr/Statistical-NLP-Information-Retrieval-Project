most archeologists content dig pottery bones relics past thomas h loy takes different approach analyzes ancient blood loy australian national university canberra developed technique literally lifting minute splotches blood stone tools bones not blood possess features identify species animal came used date artifacts 50000 years old researchers may even able extract bits genetic material prehistoric blood provide insights human evolution loy introduced technique blood residue analysis scientific world 1983 in laboratory studied 104 stone tools unearthed british columbia range age 600 1000 years found blood deposits nearly the blood belonged variety animals reported including blacktailed deer moose snowshoe rabbits caribou grizzly bears a younger artifacts contained human blood since taken blood residue analysis lab field at 10000yearold farming village turkey loy andree r wood university chicago recently extracted blood humans sheep extinct type cattle stone slab near entrance structure ominously known skull building rooms rear skull building turkish village cayonu tepesi contained 90 human skulls remains several human skeletons we dont know exactly going skull building human animal blood abundant slab wood said the occasional cutting humans animals whatever reasons may taken place added the grisly practice human sacrifice one possibility bodies may carted skull building death placed slab type ritual burial the skeletal remains back building may come individuals placed slab although decapitation marks base skulls whatever purpose skull building served loys blood analysis demonstrates people living one worlds earliest known farming villages surprisingly complex cultural practices this suggests village existed time prior 10000 years ago turn strengthens notion humans crossed threshold hunting gathering farming life considerably earlier many believed the process studying ancient blood begins locating dark patches suspected blood lowpower microscope the samples analyzed coated paper strip sensitive hemoglobin blood confirmed blood deposits scraped subjected chemical process crystallizes hemoglobin the size shape hemoglobin crystals differ among animal species allowing researchers identify type beast spilled blood to check results hemoglobin placed gel exposed electric field molecules line patterns correspond specific animal species if blood appears human tested presence human immunoglobulin aids bodys defense disease at cayonu tepesi loy wood isolated human sheep blood stone slab puzzled presence another type blood unknown nonhuman species they lifted blood bone fragments extinct cattle species discovered site found hemoglobin crystals matched unknown species taken slab this first time blood extinct animal identified loy said further excavations skull building uncovered several skulls horns belonging extinct form cattle loy wood also found large flint knife containing traces cattle human blood the knife may used human sacrifices mortuary rituals loy noted human blood often ends stone tools toolmakers accidentally cut fingers adjusting edge minute quantities blood taken skull buildings slab also placed machine separates counts carbon atoms different mass the decay specific carbon atoms samples allowed loy wood calculate blood 9000 years old carbon dating typically used charcoal considered accurate back 50000 years ago in another study loy found blood survive stone much longer 9000 years even 50000 years a stone tool site iraq dates 75000 125000 years ago yielded human blood loy originally thought came neanderthal however analysis indicated hemoglobin crystals prehistoric blood comparable modern humans loy said he acknowledged unclear species left behind blood stone tool neanderthals modern humans inhabited near east around time bulkier neanderthals became extinct around 35000 years ago many anthropologists contend modern humans considered modern shared changes anatomy skull lower body originated africa rapidly spread throughout world around 200000 years ago driving neanderthals extinction process others argue modern humans originated nearly 1 million years ago several regions world interbred extent neanderthals one way help resolve debate study genetic material dna neanderthals modern humans evidence chemical similarities differences loy said he colleagues plan extract analyze dna ancient iraqi blood using techniques modern dna fingerprinting rely enzymes chop dna distinct patterns in addition method developed british researchers extract dna bone could enable scientists compare chemical makeup dna neanderthal modern human fossils similarities would point shared genetic heritage neanderthals if studies conducted confirmed samples neanderthal dna compared dna taken iraqi blood sample loy noted beyond disputes human evolution blood residue analysis also potential clarify history specific diseases according loy the human body contains library antibodies formed fend particular illnesses those antibodies isolated ancient blood samples researchers determine ailments afflicting people died thousands tens thousands years ago yet archeologists clamoring conduct independent blood analyses dna studies prehistoric stones bones loy lamented simply trained new techniques moreover blood neanderthals even earlier members human evolutionary family undoubtedly stains millions stone tools lying museums world theres tremendous blood bank ancient stone tools waiting studied loy said
