some insurance salesmen are giving their clients poor advice on straightforward life insurance according to a report just published in which the magazine of the consumers association it sent three researchers to visit 45 vendors who were a mixture of independent financial advisers tied agents or employees of insurance companies the researchers asked for advice on the best way to protect their families income if they died early which said the cheapest and most appropriate solution for all of them would have been term insurance which pays out an agreed sum if the insured person dies within a specified period but otherwise has no cash value unfortunately because term insurance is relatively cheap it pays low commission and is often ignored by sales staff looking to maximise their income in this survey most advisers recommended term insurance but a number gave advice described by which as appalling term insurance was passed over in favour of products paying higher commission but which were in some cases completely inappropriate twelve recommended whole-of-life insurance they argued that because it could be cashed in the premiums would not be wasted but such policies are not efficient ways of saving you would probably do better buying protection and investment products separately a handful of advisers recommended endowment policies which would have tied up more money than the researchers could afford one even said the endowment could be encashed after five years which probably would have lost the client a lot of money the association of british insurers says companies are now much more aware of the importance of training salespeople to make sure they know more about the products ask clients the right questions and sell them appropriate products term insurance is essentially a simple product but can have refinements variations include automatic annual increases in the sum insured or optional increases if your needs change for example on the birth of children some policies can be renewed when they expire extended earlier or converted into a different type some insurers even waive premiums if you are ill or unemployed your state of health has obvious implications for how likely you are to die within the term for which you are insured most companies charge more for smokers and may ask you to have a medical if the sum insured is very large or the medical details you give show that you present a risk prosperity has approached the problem from a different angle with its new policy life choice this is available only to healthy people non-smokers who are not overweight and do not have a family history of heart disease everyone who applies must have a bupa health check for which they pay pounds 45, but this is offset against premiums premiums loadings for smokers and so on will vary widely between insurers so it is worth making sure you get several quotes or go to an independent adviser who can find out the best buy for you lloyd's of london can offer more flexible cover for standard or unusual risks with terms of anything from one day to 10 years the early death of the main wage-earner is an obvious worry for many families but finances can be hit even harder if the main earner becomes seriously ill or disabled and cannot work but needs special care many insurers now also offer policies which can provide a regular income while a person is ill or pay a lump sum if he develops a serious or terminal illness sometimes this can be combined with life cover although it is essential to check if this is better value than buying the two elements separately
