Question : I would like to have more information about the type of light treatment given to people who are depressed . Everything I 've read about it explains that these patients are exposed to light . If that 's all there is to it , why ca n't they just sit at home in their living rooms with the lights on ? Why is it necessary to have doctors if it 's that simple ? Answer : Light therapy for the treatment of the condition known as `` seasonal affective disorder '' is somewhat more complicated than sitting at home with the lights on . Patients undergoing this form of treatment generally spend at least an hour a day sitting about three feet in front of rows of fluorescent tubes . The tubes provide a light intensity approximately equal to that of outdoor light shortly after sunrise . From two to three weeks of such therapy may be required before symptoms disappear , but some improvement may be seen within two to four days ; this compares with the three weeks that are needed when patients are treated with antidepressant medication . Light treatment must be continued for these patients ; otherwise , the symptoms recur within a few days . Light therapy is an experimental procedure . It should not be attempted without professional supervision .
