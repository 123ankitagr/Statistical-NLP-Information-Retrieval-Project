question i would like to have more information about the type of light treatment given to people who are depressed everything i've read about it explains that these patients are exposed to light if that's all there is to it why can't they just sit at home in their living rooms with the lights on why is it necessary to have doctors if it's that simple answer light therapy for the treatment of the condition known as seasonal affective disorder is somewhat more complicated than sitting at home with the lights on patients undergoing this form of treatment generally spend at least an hour a day sitting about three feet in front of rows of fluorescent tubes the tubes provide a light intensity approximately equal to that of outdoor light shortly after sunrise from two to three weeks of such therapy may be required before symptoms disappear but some improvement may be seen within two to four days this compares with the three weeks that are needed when patients are treated with antidepressant medication light treatment must be continued for these patients otherwise the symptoms recur within a few days light therapy is an experimental procedure it should not be attempted without professional supervision
