Your front page article on Sen. Alan Cranston 's visit ( Dec. 16 ) failed to cover a very important part of his day in Orange County . His first stop was John Adams Elementary School in Santa Ana to talk about the homeless crisis with 300 fourth- and fifth-grade students . He came to personally respond to letters they wrote to him as part of a curriculum on housing amd homelessness . Many of the students who wrote to Cranston were homeless or had someone in their family who had experienced homelessness . There were no protesters , so perhaps that 's why you did not cover it . Compared to his 45-minute tour of Laguna Canyon and his forum at Century High School for 40 people , most of them protesters , Sen. Cranston 's hour spent at John Adams Elementary School seems pretty newsworthy to me . MARY CAPPELLINI Newport Beach Mary Cappellini teaches at the Adams School .
