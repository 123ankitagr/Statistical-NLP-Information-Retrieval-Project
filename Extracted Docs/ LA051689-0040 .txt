A provision for creating a nonprofit consumer advocacy corporation to fight for `` fair '' automobile insurance rates was amended into pending legislation by Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti ( D-Los Angeles ) . The proposal is a response to a recent state Supreme Court decision that upheld most of the voter-approved Proposition 103 , but struck down a provision to create an organization which would represent the consumer in state insurance rate proceedings . Insurance companies would be required to inform their customers that they could become members of the consumer advocacy group , which would be funded by voluntary donations . Roberti said the amended bill could come up for a floor vote this week .
