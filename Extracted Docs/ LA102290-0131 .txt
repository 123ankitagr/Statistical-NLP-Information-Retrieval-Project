Detroit Pistons Isiah Thomas and Bill Laimbeer , who underwent surgery over the weekend , are expected to recover in time for the team 's Nov. 2 season-opener . Pistons spokesman Matt Dobek said today that Thomas had surgery for a ruptured tear duct and will miss Wednesday 's exhibition game against the New York Knicks . Laimbeer has a fractured left cheekbone and will miss the next three exhibition games . Both were injured in Saturday 's exhibition game against Seattle . Thomas was cut in the first quarter of Saturday 's 101-82 loss to Seattle when he was poked in the eye by Sedale Threatt , while Laimbeer was elbowed by Olden Polynice . Neither is expected to miss the opener against Milwaukee , Dobek said . Also on the Pistons ' injured list is Dennis Rodman , with a nagging ankle injury sustained last season .
