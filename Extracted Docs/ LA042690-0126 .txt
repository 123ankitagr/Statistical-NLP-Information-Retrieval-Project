tantamount vulnerability unexpected in ireland 1840s unexpected fungus transported ship north america invasion deadly surreptitious the fungus found easy target potato fields backbone irish agriculture potatoes nearly identical genetically susceptible fungus it swept fields laying waste billions potatoes as many 2 12 million people died irish potato famine perhaps devastating example modern history dangers genetic uniformity since farmers plant breeders pesticide makers scientists learned great deal protecting crops now farmers know control fungus devasted irish potato fields well many diseases parasites environmental conditions endanger food crops using biotechnology techniques isolating transfering specific genes scientists plant breeders even learning engineer plants manufacture resistance pests disease but important lesson irish potato famine without genetic diversity real protection food crops of efforts conservation genetic diversity involving food crops sophisticated in part thats adequate food supply vital also centuries farmers gardeners using perfecting plantbreeding techniques relied form conservation these techniques ever tested fields laboratories resulted vast increases quantity quality food grown world the new varieties highyielding diseaseresistant wonder crops best suited mass agriculture techniques dominate us farming example

after corn leaf blight study national academy sciences reported many major food crops impressively uniform genetically impressively vulnerable the problem corn vital crops hard red winter wheat soybeans potatoes the shock waves corn blight registered throughout international agricultural community a new agency support worldwide collection preservation agricultural diversity formed 1974

loss genetic diversity most plant breeding research around world concentrated dozen species crops thousands thousands food crops raised eaten around world major economic significance in many cases research specialized aim develop higheryielding varieties crops this results collecting practices policies focus genetic materials modern already highly bred cultivated varieties called cultivars for plant genetic information equivalent world history library books handful countries volumes written last decades so like many collections research center seed banks safes genetic diversity reflections pragmatic goals said dr calvin o qualset director californias genetic resources conservation program neglected banks seeds lesser known crops less globally significant still may important particular region culture also underrepresented seed banks primitive varieties wild relatives land races major crops whose genetic properties less understood difficult use breeding programs land races varieties cultivated bred traditional techniques peasant farmers often hundreds thousands years third world development projects increased environmental woes reaching native habitats crops put highest risk crops least represented seed banks the countries poorest commercial agriculture whose people may subsist local crops arent protected major collections remain vulnerable irretrievable crop losses in meantime farmers around world planting new often hybrid crop varieties trend helped along consolidated globalized seed industry instead old ways saving seeds best one years crop planting next peasant farmers must buy seeds planting when turned modern farming techniques new hybrid varieties third world farmers often abandoned historical food crops in many countries process often encouraged foreign
