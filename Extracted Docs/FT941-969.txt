Mr Han Sung-joo , the South Korean foreign minister , said at the weekend that his country would support the UN Security Council 's issuing a statement on the North Korea nuclear problem rather than taking the tougher action of adopting a resolution on the matter , writes John Burton from Seoul . He explained that this strategy would persuade China to support a resolution criticising North Korea if it still continued to block international nuclear inspections after the statement was issued . ' I believe that it 's advisable to start with the council president 's statement so that a resolution can be adopted unanimously , ' he said . South Korean President Kim Young-sam will mix business with diplomacy during his visit to China , hoping to win new orders for Korean companies . Economic issues that will be discussed include the Chinese purchase of Korean telephone exchanges and a proposed Sino-Korea project to develop and market mid-sized commercial airliners .
