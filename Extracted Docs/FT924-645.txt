christmas is coming and the price of prawns is going up illustrating both the changing nature of the australian christmas and the danger of over-exploiting fragile fishing grounds apart from the weather an english visitor of 30 or even 20 years ago would have been hard pressed to spot the difference between christmas in sydney and christmas in sydenham south london inspired by the view held by sir robert menzies australia's prime minister from 1946 to 1965, who portrayed his country as the modern-day jewel in the british crown australians were still doing everything they could to evade the realities of the un-english climate and geography ignoring summer temperatures of 30 degrees centigrade or more families ate heavy meals of hot turkey roast beef and plum pudding and then watched or listened to the queen's traditional christmas day broadcast from london presents were piled around imported christmas trees holly wreaths were nailed to front doors and the most enthusiastic attempted to simulate the effect of snow on window panes even in the 1960 s there must have been plenty of australians of non-british heritage who thought this collective attachment to the traditional christmas a bit strange in a country where december falls in midsummer but few of that generation of immigrants felt able to resist the pressure from the anglo-saxon majority to conform by becoming more australian which meant of course more british now attitudes are changing and the style of christmas celebrations is becoming less homogeneous reflecting the move towards a more genuinely australian culture which started a decade or so ago for one thing australian government policy is now officially multicultural which has helped give minority ethnic groups the self-confidence to develop or reinterpret their own christmas traditions for another the sheer number of immigrants who have come to australia since the second world war more than doubling the population from 8 m to 17 m have altered the ethnic balance of the population and weakened ties with the so-called mother country fewer than 60 per cent of australians now claim family ties with britain and ireland compared with more than 90 per cent 40 years ago the new australians are italian greek yugoslav arab and increasingly asian few of the new australians will spend christmas day in the house or garden where the menzies-era australians felt most comfortable they will be at the beach or at the many parks and recreation areas maintained by local councils which often include family-style barbecues others will work out their own compromise between tradition and common sense a swiss friend plans to cook her family's traditional swiss ham outside in a barbecue english friends will cook a turkey the day before and eat it cold with salad but it is not just recent immigrants who are finding new ways to celebrate christmas many australians of british extraction whose families have lived in their new homeland for generations are also taking a fresh look at the merits of tradition after all britain has been consciously cutting its ties with the old dominions since it joined the european community in 1973, encouraging australians to come to terms with their own region from this perspective paul keating the labor prime minister was only reflecting the drift of opinion when he suggested earlier this year that australia should become a republic and remove the union symbol from the corner of the national flag these ideas are still at the formative stage and it may be years before either comes to fruition but once people start thinking about such weighty ideas as national destiny just about every facet of life is likely to come under the microscope so it is hardly surprising that there are less frost-inspired decorations around this year or that snowy windowpanes have almost entirely disappeared or that fewer christmas cards feature horse-drawn sleighs jingling down snowy village lanes even the schools are getting in on the act children are still making models of santa's sleigh but the motive power is more likely to be supplied by kangaroos than reindeer and koalas and wallabies are appearing in the christmas stable there are still some oddities about christmas down under at my local carol service in north sydney for example shirt-sleeved children sang uncomprehendingly about events in the deep mid-winter and appeared entirely unimpressed by the boxing day trials of poor frozen good king wenceslas increasingly however australians are ready to put their own stamp on christmas even if no two people agree about what it should be in time a uniquely australian christmas may emerge reflecting the development of a more mature and self-confident society but for now it's everyone for himself me i shall be throwing another prawn on the barbie and dreaming of a white christmas
