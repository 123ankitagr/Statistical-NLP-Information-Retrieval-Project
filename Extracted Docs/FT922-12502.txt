mr alan greenspan us federal reserve chairman sought to reassure financial markets yesterday that recent sharp falls in japanese share prices would not have serious effects in other countries testifying before the senate banking committee in washington he said the fed's unexpected decision last week to cut short-term interest rates by a quarter-point to 3.75 per cent reflected weak growth of the money supply and bank credit it was not a response to sharp falls in japanese share prices in my judgment the impact on the us from japanese stock price changes to date is likely to be limited mr greenspan said japan would continue to export capital provided it ran a current account surplus regardless of share prices falls shifts in the composition of capital exports might cause some price adjustments in overseas markets but these need not be terribly disruptive japan held only 2-3 per cent of us treasury securities and an even smaller fraction of equities he said falls in japanese share prices might lead to retrenchment by japanese banks but world-wide credit conditions will not be substantially weakened by a scaling back by japanese banks japanese share price falls could have a significant negative effect on japanese investment and hence on growth however the separate contribution of the stock market decline to weaker japanese demand for us exports is not expected to be large
