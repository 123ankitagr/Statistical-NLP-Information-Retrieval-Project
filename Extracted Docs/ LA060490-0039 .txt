on a cold dreary sunday the leader of the soviet union flew to the great plains for the sort of warm hearty welcome that he no longer gets at home greeted by the orchestral music of shostakovich at the airport the sound of ringing bells at the governors mansion and chants of gorby gorby at nearly all points in between mikhail s gorbachev proved that while he may be a bust in st petersburg hes still boffo in st paul were excited to have you here and the whole state is excited gov rudy perpich told gorbachev as he stepped down the stairs from his airplane even before gorbachevs customized ilyushin jet with the hammer and sickle flag painted high on its tail had left washingtons andrews air force base gorby fever had seized the twin cities of minneapolis and st paul back home in moscow or leningrad which was known as st petersburg in the prerevolutionary days when it served as the czarist capital gorbachevs political stock has been dropping in tandem with the production figures for the soviet economy but it was different here youre a great man youre a great man two young college students shouted to gorbachev as he did one of his bynow signature impromptu walks outside his motorcade gorbachev left minnesotans with only one disappointment at his request he originally had been scheduled to make a visit to a true bit of midwestern americana a tour of the brand family dairy farm 20 miles south of st paul but the soviet leader fell so far behind on his schedule that he had to cancel the visit but this could not rob the day of its demonstration of unabashed enthusiasm for gorbachev even the dissenters baltic nationalists eritrean separatists vietnamese patriots seemed goodnatured in their dissent as he left a luncheon at the governors mansion gorbachev wearing a black raincoat and a gray fedora to guard him from the drizzle and temperatures hovering below 50 stopped to talk to an 11yearold boy brandon peterson speaking through a translator he asked what grade are you in sixth the boy replied thats as old as my granddaughter gorbachev said he then stepped into his long black zil limousine and proceeded on a motorcade through the streets of st paul and minneapolis the soviet leader twice stopped the motorcade so he could clamber out of the zil and shake hands with eager cheering minnesotans at one stop as gorbachev held his hands out to a throng of approximately 80 onlookers a us official murmured he ought to run for office here two admirers handed raisa gorbachev a sign that featured a heart and the message we love mikhail and raisa gorbachev the soviet first lady waved the sign at the crowd minnesotans offered other encouraging words on the placards they held along the motorcade route go glasnost president gorbachev keep hope alive and were with you gorby one that may have defied translation was the sign lauding mr gorbachev a cool dude gorbachev found the largest crowd several thousand minnesotans waiting along the driveway to the state capitol in st paul a large minority were balticamerican nationalists waving lithuanian estonian and latvian flags while waiting the balticamericans tried to inspire the crowd with a chant negotiations no occupations but a group of young university students drowned out the chant with a wellknown chant from a beer commercial tastes great less filling even the balticamericans laughed one minnesotan in the crowd told his wife hes an amazing charmer not folksy but you respect him hes quite a guy throughout the region residents planned their day around the gorbachev visit road crews rose early sunday morning braving a chill and driving rain to line 15 miles of interstate 35 from the airport through downtown with shining new bright orange plastic highway cones to mark off gorbachevs motorcade route portable highway signs that normally flash messages like traffic delay and construction next 10 miles were reprogrammed to display welcome president gorbachev in english and russian the obvious purpose of the soviet leaders visit here as well as his next stop in san francisco where gorbachev was to arrive about 1030 pm pdt was a combination of trade and tourism this is an opportunity for him to get out and see the united states said jack f matlock the us ambassador to moscow he noted that during gorbachevs previous two summit trips to the united states the soviet leader saw only washington and new york the visit also gave gorbachev an opportunity to meet with midwestern business leaders from both agribusiness and high technology in an afternoon conference in minneapolis calling for investment gorbachev assured his listeners you will not lose your money in the soviet union gorbachev underscored that point at his final stop here a visit to the control data corp plant where he tried out a computer terminal control data has been exporting mainframe computers to the soviets since 1968 it was one of the first us firms to do so the cancellation of the visit to the brand farm did not surprise american officials for days they had been saying that his schedule was too crowded you cant visit a mans farm in a few minutes a farmer wants to show you his pigs his chickens and so forth and rightfully so said us assistant chief of protocol william f black as a consolation officials announced that richard and cecilia brand who own the farm would be at the airport to shake hands with gorbachev before he left town for san francisco the brands and about two dozen of their relatives showed up at the airport to say goodby to the gorbachavs as richard and cecilia chatted with the gorbachevs some of the relatives kept taking photos of the scene at the side of the departing plane a few minutes later brand told a reporter i cant begin to tell you how disappointed i am there is little doubt that the trip had another special dividend for gorbachev beyond trade and tourism it gave a politician who has been through a rough period a chance to renew himself in the unaccustomed warmth of friendly crowds at the airport before gorbachev arrived security was tight with us marine guards sternly warning reporters against venturing outside the designated press area if you stray you will be shot they will take you out a security agent who declined to identify himself announced at one point but such excessive precautions relaxed within minutes of gorbachevs arrival as he stopped his 42car motorcade and took a 10 to 15minute stroll down a street in downtown minneapolis before walking up a redcarpeted path into the governors mansion complex arminarm with his wife raisa gorbachev looked like an american political candidate in his blue pinstripe suit and red tie the soviet leader left aside an overcoat as he crossed repeatedly from one side of the street to the other the crowd included a group of about 40 demonstrators who were protesting soviet policy in afghanistan and azerbaijan some who identified themselves as minnesota muslims for peace and justice in the world passed out green leaflets charging soviet genocide against muslims continues at the airport in minneapolis gorbachev was met by a series of minnesota leaders former vice president walter f mondale approached the us ambassador matlock and quietly asked him what to make of the recent election of boris n yeltsin as president of the russian republic they gorbachev and yeltsin are going to have to work together matlock said although raisa gorbachev joined her husband for most of the days activities she left the conference with business leaders to follow a brief program of her own at the end of the afternoon en route to the south minneapolis home of what had been billed as a typical american family the soviet first lady decided to stop at two typical american stores pepitos mexican delicatessen and the snyder drug store at the drug store the soviet leaders wife questioned carey kilbo the merchandise manager about pay working conditions and the ingredients in some of the products she asked for example why one nail polish cost more than another kilbo explained that the expensive nail polish stays on longer times staff writers jim mann and
