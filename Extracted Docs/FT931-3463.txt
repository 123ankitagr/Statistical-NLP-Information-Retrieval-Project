who stands to lose the most from australia's rejection of the conservative opposition parties in saturday's general election the answer is probably not john hewson the luckless conservative leader but kerry packer australia's richest gambler in the past packer has made money under both labor and conservative governments but the latest election result means there will be no change in australia's banking and media laws that is bad news for packer who owns 10 per cent of westpac banking corporation and has recently acquired 5 per cent of fairfax conrad black's australian newspaper group packer would like to bid for both groups but is prevented by labor legislation which limits him to 15 per cent of each he could have a tilt at fairfax if he sold the channel nine television operation but that would mean giving up control of australia's top-rated tv channel which is also a big money-spinner however packer has been dealt worse hands before and come up trumps he is still showing a profit on his westpac punt and the underlying profitability at fairfax suggests he isn't going to lose a fortune there nevertheless it would be surprising if packer were content to remain a passive investor for long although westpac doesn't want kerry on its board perhaps conrad black should hedge his bets by inviting him to join his fairfax board even black might feel happier with kerry on the inside
