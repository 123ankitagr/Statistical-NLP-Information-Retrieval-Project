who stands to lose the most from australias rejection of the conservative opposition parties in saturdays general election the answer is probably not john hewson the luckless conservative leader but kerry packer australias richest gambler in the past packer has made money under both labor and conservative governments but the latest election result means there will be no change in australias banking and media laws that is bad news for packer who owns 10 per cent of westpac banking corporation and has recently acquired 5 per cent of fairfax conrad blacks australian newspaper group packer would like to bid for both groups but is prevented by labor legislation which limits him to 15 per cent of each he could have a tilt at fairfax if he sold the channel nine television operation but that would mean giving up control of australias toprated tv channel which is also a big moneyspinner however packer has been dealt worse hands before and come up trumps he is still showing a profit on his westpac punt and the underlying profitability at fairfax suggests he isnt going to lose a fortune there nevertheless it would be surprising if packer were content to remain a passive investor for long although westpac doesnt want kerry on its board perhaps conrad black should hedge his bets by inviting him to join his fairfax board even black might feel happier with kerry on the inside
