American aid to El Salvador is emboldening the government 's military and destroying the country , Roman Catholic priests said Monday as they protested U.S. policy and prayed for six slain Jesuit priests . At a demonstration by more than 600 protesters , federal officials arrested 110 demonstrators -- some of them priests -- for sitting down and blocking the doors of the Federal Building . San Francisco police arrested 26 other demonstrators for blocking the sidewalk . Virtually all were cited and released . About 150 Jesuits were among the protesters who prayed , chanted and carried signs to commemorate the slaying of the Jesuits at Central American University last week . `` It has become very clear over this decade that United States aid , which is up to $ 1.4 million every day , is that which is destroying the people of El Salvador , '' said Father William J . Wood , executive director of the California Catholic Conference . President Bush declared Monday that he can not abandon `` a fragile democracy '' and said any congressional aid cutoff to El Salvador would be an unacceptable response to the murders . Wood said the Salvadoran government is under control of the ARENA party , `` which has proved itself as bad as Hitler ever was in its commitment to work only for the welfare of those who they consider to be the pure .
