A California insurance dealer accused by federal prosecutors in a sweeping nationwide health insurance fraud case has been acquitted in the first of as many as five trials . Angelo T. Commito , along with an insurance broker and a union official , was found innocent Thursday by a federal jury of charges of embezzlement from the union 's pension fund and accepting kickbacks on insurance contracts . The jury deliberated seven hours before reaching the verdict . Commito , 43 , who owns Labor Health and Benefits Plan , still faces trial in San Francisco on fraud charges in connection with his business of supplying union insurance coverage . `` The government vendetta against Angelo Commito is shown for what it is : a bunch of rumors and gossip that can not stand up to the test of a jury trial , '' said Deputy Federal Public Defender Harry L. Hellerstein , Commito 's lawyer in San Francisco . In separate indictments in San Francisco , San Diego , Atlanta and Baltimore , Commito is accused of paying kickbacks to an undercover FBI agent .
