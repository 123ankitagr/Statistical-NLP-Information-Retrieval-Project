As many as 12 million Americans would give up cigarettes if doctors urged their smoking patients to quit and supported those who took the advice , Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said . Koop joined the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society in challenging phynsicians and health professionals to counsel their patients who smoke . Koop and the cancer groups asserted that smokers whose doctors help them quit are perhaps six times more likely to kick the habit for good . Yet the surgeon general said a 1987 survey found that only 49 % of smokers reported that their physicians ever advised them to quit . To boost that figure , the cancer organizations announced that they will send 100,000 doctors a brochure that tells how to stop the habit .
