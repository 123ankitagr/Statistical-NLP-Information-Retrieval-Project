The inhabitants of Worcester Park have good reason to feel miffed at tonight 's Conservative party political broadcast . 'John Major . The Journey , ' concentrates on the prime minister 's path from obscurity to 10 Downing Street . Though it lingers at length on the prime minister 's Brixton boyhood , there is no mention of leafy and well-heeled Worcester Park where young John also spent many a formative year . Could it be that that cosy interlude just failed to square with the story-line ?
