Former world heavyweight boxing champion Muhammad Ali was quoted today as saying black Christians should have their own black Jesus . Ali , in an interview with the Sun , said the traditional portrayal of Jesus , angels and saints as white was meant to reinforce white supremacy and make blacks feel inferior . `` The reason is because the whites did n't want their children to see a ( black man ) up there on the cross , '' he added . `` If they continue with their icons , then black people should put up their own of a black Jesus , black saints and black angels . To them , Jesus is black , should be black . But to God he is no color . '' The Sun quoted a Catholic Church spokesman as saying that he would not take on Ali in the ring but that he was wrong . `` Jesus was Middle Eastern , '' the spokesman said .
