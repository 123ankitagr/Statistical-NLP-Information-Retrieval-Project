The commander of Russia 's Northern Fleet said yesterday a US submarine had been discovered in territorial waters off the Arctic Kola peninsula and had left only after being given several warnings . Admiral Oleg Yerofeyev said the craft had been detected on Wednesday 8km off the entrance to the narrow Kola Bay , which lies 30km from the huge top-secret naval base at Severomorsk , home to the Northern Fleet . The foreign ministry said the boat was located in almost exactly the same spot where the US nuclear submarine Baton Rouge crashed into a Russian nuclear submarine in February 1992 . However , the Northern Fleet later said the vessel 's identity had yet to be confirmed . Admiral Yerofeyev said that , given that Moscow had cut its naval operations , 'provocations by western submarines can only spark Russian worry and condemnation ' .
