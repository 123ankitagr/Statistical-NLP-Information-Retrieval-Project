talks between china and taiwan on improving working relations inched forward this week in nanjing the yangtze river town but at the trading and investment level the relationship continues to progress strongly too strongly for some taiwanese officials pledged taiwanese investment in the mainland exceeds dollars 20bn pounds 125bn making it the second largest investor after hong kong more noteworthy perhaps is the rate of investment while investors from hong kong singapore and thailand have been active since the mid1980s taiwanese businessmen really got started in 1991 the year taipei lifted its formal ban on business links with the mainland according to the mainlandpublished china economic news taiwanese investment amounted to dollars 34bn in 1991 dollars 55bn in 1992 and dollars 10bn last year a total of nearly dollars 19bn by the end of 1993 this estimate vastly exceeds official taiwanese investment figures dollars 4bn at the end of june the investment commission of the ministry of economic affairs says one explanation for this discrepancy is that many taiwanese have chosen not to report their activities some have channelled their investment through subsidiaries in hong kong and singapore taiwanese officials appear resigned to the fact that investment in the mainland will continue to grow rapidly but their attitudes sometimes show two differing viewpoints on one hand they can see real advantages in taiwanese business positioning itself in the worlds largest market on the other they worry understandably about taiwans economy becoming captive to china and investment being drained away from taiwan mr hansen chien spokesman for the ruling kuomintang reflecting gloomy concerns of the taiwanese establishment about becoming caught up in the mainlands embrace said we are getting more worried about too much investment in mainland china we are becoming too dependent on the mainland at a political level mr chien also gave voice to underlying taiwanese worries every time we talk with mainland china he said it seems we are losing more and more of our chips we dont have too many chips to lose every time we throw out a chip we should get something back attempts by the authorities to mount what they describe as a go south policy to persuade investors to put their money in southeast asian economies is one among several responses aimed at tempering enthusiasm for mainland investment we are encouraging our people to go to southeast asia but not discouraging them investing in the mainland on condition we derive mutual benefit says mr leo tseng deputy directorgeneral of the board of foreign trade taiwanese investment at the end of 1993 in thailand malaysia philippines indonesia and vietnam the main destinations for taiwans southeast asian investment matched that of investment in the mainland but again the buildup of investment in china is proving much more rapid see chart typical of attitudes among larger investors to putting their money in the mainland as opposed to southeast asia is that expressed by representatives of president foods group the big taiwanese food processor that has ambitions of becoming the worlds biggest food conglomerate the company has set up four factories in southeast asia but targeted the mainland because executives believe it provides better opportunities president foods is establishing 12 companies involved in making a wide range of products including instant noodles biscuits animal feed and car batteries since 1992 it has invested dollars 100m with plans to double that figure but its representatives acknowledge that business in the mainland remains extremely difficult among problems is a lack of managerial talent and difficulties in securing market share in a highly fragmented market where local brand loyalties dominate transport bottlenecks militate against the building of national brands taiwanese officials point out that while thousands of taiwanese businessmen are continuing to rush to the mainland the success rate is patchy at best mr steven wu director of the industrial development and investment centre of the ministry of economic affairs estimates that 3050 per cent of enterprises are making money the rest have had a very sad experience he says problems encountered include overmanning bureaucratic obstacles and difficulties with local partners mr wu noted that the success rate of investments in southeast asia was higher but it seems that despite well publicised difficulties taiwanese investors are determined to make their presence felt on the mainland attracted as they are by low labour costs a huge market and in some cases propelled by a desire to escape from an increasingly active environmental lobby in taiwan mr s lee viceminister in the ministry of economic affairs responsible for overseeing approvals for mainland investments believes investment growth will slow but notes taiwanese businessmen are beginning to make larger commitments mr lee said that of the whole list of 9000 items covered by investment guidelines taiwanese business was permitted to make about 4588 on the mainland another 4000 items were in a grey area meaning approval would be withheld for the time being and about 1000 hightech items were forbidden industries in the grey area include cement factories and petrochemical plants involved in producing synthetic fibres in which taiwan leads the world the authorities are reluctant to allow competing industries to move across the taiwan straits mr lee says we are reviewing our policy on investment approvals cautiously and progressively the problem for the taiwanese authorities however is that pressure from taiwanese business is such that it is having great difficulty holding the line
