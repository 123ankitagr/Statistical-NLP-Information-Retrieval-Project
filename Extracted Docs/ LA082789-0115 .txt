molly giles review of william faulkner american writer book review aug 20 stands as the first to my knowledge to dig beneath the sheer massiveness of the volume to expose biographer frederic r karl's destructive bone-picking of a great american novelist giles charitably refrained from pointing out that the biography is largely an appropriation of the published works of recognized faulkner scholars and that his principal contribution is a warped far-out psychoanalysis of faulkner's personal life cradle to grave the definitive biography of faulkner has been a work-in-progress for many years by garvel collings who knows more about his subject than any other living american giles and the book review are to be commended for a brave critical cat-scan of a grievously flawed biography orin borsten studio city
