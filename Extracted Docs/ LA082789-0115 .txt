Molly Giles ' review of `` William Faulkner : American Writer '' ( Book Review , Aug. 20 ) stands as the first , to my knowledge , to dig beneath the sheer massiveness of the volume to expose biographer Frederic R. Karl 's destructive bone-picking of a great American novelist . Giles charitably refrained from pointing out that the biography is largely an appropriation of the published works of recognized Faulkner scholars and that his principal contribution is a warped , far-out psychoanalysis of Faulkner 's personal life , cradle to grave . The definitive biography of Faulkner has been a work-in-progress for many years by Garvel Collings , who knows more about his subject than any other living American . Giles and the Book Review are to be commended for a brave critical CAT-scan of a grievously flawed biography . ORIN BORSTEN STUDIO CITY
