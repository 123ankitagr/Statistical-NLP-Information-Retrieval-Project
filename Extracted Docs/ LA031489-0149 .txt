Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. Ltd. , Japan 's biggest consumer electronics company , today named an American to head its U.S. operations for the first time and said it hoped the move will make it more welcome in the United States . The nod went to Richard A. Kraft , a 15-year veteran of the company who will succeed Akiya Imura as president and chief operating officer of Matsushita Electric Corp. of America . Matsushita has more than 7,000 employees in the United States , scattered from Hawaii to California , Illinois , Washington , Tennessee and New Jersey . It sells televisions , videocassette recorders and microwave ovens and other products under the Panasonic , Quasar and Technics brand names , as well as business and industrial equipment . Kraft said being American would make him more effective than his predecessors in dealing with American employees , government bodies and communities where Matsushita has operations . `` The American public today seems to be ambivalent about foreign companies in the United States , '' Kraft said . By building Matsushita 's reputation as a good corporate citizen , he said , `` We can ultimately overcome any possible friction and be welcome in this country . ''
