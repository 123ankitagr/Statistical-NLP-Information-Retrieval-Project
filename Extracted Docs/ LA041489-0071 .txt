Red foxes are fair game for government trappers at a national wildlife refuge in Orange County , a Los Angeles federal judge declared in finding that the foxes can be killed because they pose a significant threat to two endangered bird species . U.S. District Judge Robert J. Kelleher refused an animal rights ' group 's request for an injunction , pending a trial on the trapping program at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station . The Navy and U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service had ordered the trapping and killing of several hundred of the non-native foxes since 1986 in an effort they say is essential to preserve two species of birds that nest in the 1,100-acre refuge on the naval base . The foxes are believed to prey on the eggs and hatchlings of the light-footed clapper rail and the California least tern .
