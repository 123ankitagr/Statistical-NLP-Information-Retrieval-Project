INTEL has filed a complaint with the US International Trade Commission against a Taiwanese personal computer manufacturer in a move to try to block imports of computers that contain 'clones ' of its microprocessor chips . The action is the latest in a Intel 's campaign of litigation against Advanced Micro Devices and Cyrix , two US chip companies that produce their own versions of Intel 's top-selling chips . The ITC complaint alleges that Twinhead , a Taiwanese maker of notebook computers , is selling products in the US that infringe an Intel patent . Intel has related patent infringement cases pending in US courts against both AMD and Cyrix . The trade action against a competitors ' customer follows a decision in the Cyrix patent case , in which the court refused to grant Cyrix an injunction preventing Intel from filing a suit against Cyrix customers . AMD said it believed its customers were protected from infringing Intel patents by a cross-licensing agreement between the two companies . That agreement is , however , the subject of separate litigation .
