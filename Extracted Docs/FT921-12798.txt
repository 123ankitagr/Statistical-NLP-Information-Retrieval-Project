advantage of this valuable tax concession then again you must act before april it is best to do deals before budget day to be on the safe side this applies in particular to the covenanted buyback

on saving accounts following last years abolition of composite rate tax crt on interest on bank and building society accounts nontaxpayers need no longer pay any tax on these accounts if you are
