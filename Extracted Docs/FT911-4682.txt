nippon yusen the flag carrier of japans shipping lines has always bought its ships from domestic companies but the long queue of buyers at japanese yards has just forced even the patriotic nippon yusen to turn to taiwan for a new bulk carrier we havent bought a ship from outside japan since the end of the second world war this is quite a historic thing we would have to to wait three years in japan so we chose taiwan anyway its cheaper there about 10 per cent cheaper a nippon yusen spokesman said shipbuilding companies now complain that the biggest problem is not a lack of orders but a shortage of staff and they are known to be routinely turning down orders in the confident expectation that ship prices up 179 per cent in the year to end march will continue to rise at the nkk corporation yard at tsu on the central coast the order books are full until april 1994 and mr heiichiro miyazaki the companys managing director suggested that increasing demand is likely to mean supply shortages and strong prices in the second half of the decade having experienced a severe slump in the mid1980s the shipbuilders are determined that pricecutting and other examples of excessive competition will not interfere with their longterm profit plans a spokesman for mitsubishi heavy industries mhi said that production facilities will not be increased even though the company could take orders and ishikawajimaharima heavy industries ihi with its facilities booked until 1993 said that it built 10 ships last year will build 10 ships this year and plans to build 10 ships in financial 1992 we dont have plans to increase our capacity mainly because we have problems finding workers the other problem is that the low level of profits we are now getting does not justify the level of capital investment needed to increase capacity an ihi spokesman said sumitomo heavy industries predicts a 40 per cent increase in pretax profit for the year to march 1991 and kawasaki heavy industries which reported a loss in 1988 expects a 20 per cent profit increase for the year mitsui engineering and shipbuilding which had operating losses in 1987 and 1988 is likely to announce a y4bn dollars 29m pretax profit about 5 per cent up on 1989 while the labour shortage is a serious problem japans jobs to applicants ratio is 1461 an automation drive has reduced the number of manual working hours by about 70 per cent since 1973 as well the companies and the transport ministry are coordinating a campaign to improve the image of shipbuilding to attract young workers the ministry is contributing to the image renovation campaign by sponsoring the development of a futuristic cargo vessel while it is presumed that diversification into areas such as aerospace will help to change the publics general impression of the heavy industrial companies japanese shipbuilders are generally relieved that the era of savage competition with south korea is over one company official said that there is now pricing harmony among the worlds two largest shipbuilding nations which have close to 75 per cent of the market japanese companies estimate that they have about 48 per cent and south korean firms about 25 per cent while japanese companies insist that supply has been limited by a 24 per cent cut in capacity administered by the transport ministry modernisation of facilities has allowed the yards to build more ships per dock about 80 per cent of the building is now done outside the dock itself giving companies the potential to increase capacity if such an increase was thought to be in the companies best interests it is clear that japanese builders are not planning such an increase as it would conflict with the general perception in the market of limited supply and with hopes for a steady increase in prices over the next few years as prices increase shipbuilding will become a more important revenue source for the diversificationminded heavy industrials mhi said that shipbuilding accounts for about 9 per cent of sales with power plants aircraft and other industrial equipment now more important sources of incomes but shipbuilding still accounts for about 36 per cent of sales at hitachi zosen this company expects pretax profits to more than double to y5bn in the year to march 1991
