the building of tension on the korean peninsula and the possibility that north korea is developing nuclear weapons have stirred deep private concerns in japan that are masked by a public calm reports of a north korean warning that if the country had a nuclear weapon it would be aimed at japan rather than at south korea or the us have produced either silence or cryptic responses from japanese government officials and the media reasons for the uneasy silence are the sensitivities towards a large korean community in japan and a reliance on the protective shield of us forces that makes it difficult for many japanese to discuss openly the possibility of a military crisis on their doorstep it is a very sensitive issue ms mayumi moriyama member of japans upper house and a former chief cabinet secretary said earlier this week as we are much closer and have a very close relationship with them its very difficult to discuss it openly bureaucrats and politicians alike have been reticent on the subject the report that north koreas ambassador to india had stated his countrys weapons would be aimed at japan produced the response that the foreign ministry was trying to confirm the comments we are taking the matter very seriously but we do not want unwittingly to arouse the emotional temperature by making comments one official said a standard line by foreign ministry officials officials are avoiding comments that could be interpreted by north korea as japanese aggression or that could upset korean residents in japan north korean officials claim that they suspect japans nuclear motives but pyongyang has refused to allow full inspections of its nuclear sites prompting international concern that it is developing nuclear weapons the lack of official japanese comment has meant that fears of developments on the korean peninsula and to what extent the country is prepared for the worst have been fed largely on speculation educated or otherwise japanese newspapers have reported this week that an unnamed government official had commented cryptically on the need to review japans defence programme in the light of the north korean situation
