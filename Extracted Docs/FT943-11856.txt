The UK , Sweden and Greece are likely to see particularly strong growth in advertising expenditure in 1995 , according to the latest forecasts from the UK 's Advertising Association and the European Advertising Tripartite * . After three consecutive years of falling expenditure in the UK , growth is forecast to accelerate to 6.2 per cent this year and 5.5 per cent in 1995 . Says the forecast : 'The UK has not seen this rate of advertising expenditure growth since the boom years of 1986-88 . ' Strongest real growth rates for 1994 are forecast for newspapers ( 8.3 per cent ) ; radio ( 11.2 per cent ) ; and cinema ( 7 per cent ) . Even struggling trade magazines are reported to be picking up , and the overall picture is likely to be similar in 1995 . In Sweden , recovery is expected this year as the economy improves : the forecast is for real growth of 5 per cent in 1994 and 6.5 per cent in 1995 . The television sector is experiencing strong growth , mostly at the expense of newspapers and magazines , while the recently-deregulated radio sector will also increase its share of advertising . In spite of the Greek economy being stagnant last year , total advertising expenditure grew by more than 8 per cent in real terms . The growth forecast for this year is 7.5 per cent and 6 per cent in 1995 . The fastest growing sectors this year are likely to be television , newspapers and outdoor , while magazines should see some real growth in 1995 . In a separate Advertising Association publication * * , an analysis of UK advertising spending in the first quarter of 1994 shows growth in all main media sectors . Radio did particularly well , with revenue rising in real terms by more than 24 per cent , compared with the first quarter of last year . Outdoor advertising also did well , with an increase of almost 17 per cent . The quarterly survey shows that national newspapers , 'fattened by the now sharply rising tide of classified job recruitment advertising , experienced a 12 per cent real increase over the same period ' .
