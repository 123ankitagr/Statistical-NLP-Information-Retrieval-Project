latin american banana producers have offered an olive branch to their caribbean neighbours saying they want to prevent the increasingly strident debate over access to the european community market from becoming a banana war the caribbeans have grabbed at the opportunity for dialogue and have invited the latin americans to a meeting of trade ministers likely to be held in st lucia later this month to discuss the banana market amid caribbean hopes that the arguments can be resolved without damage to the islands exports and their fragile economies the appeal for conciliation was made by mr rafael calderon the president of costa rica to the caribbean community caricom when he addressed the communitys annual summit meeting costa rica is not a member of the community but is seeking observer status we should resolve this dialogue without a banana war mr calderon said after speaking to the caribbean leaders the fight for just relations with europe must continue but there should not be a southsouth fight we back preferences for caribbean bananas but we do not want the ec to lower the quantities now exported by latin america to the ec the communitys leaders immediately issued the invitation to the latin americans to attend this months ministerial meeting there is a glimmer of hope in the costa rican statement that a banana war should be avoided said mr john compton the prime minister of st lucia one of the four islands of the windward group whose economies are heavily dependent on bananas at the heart of the dispute is the new ec banana import regime that took effect at the start of this month which imposes a 2mtonnesayear quota for latin american fruit shipments within the quota attract a duty of ecu100 pounds 7760 a tonne while for imports above this level the duty is ecu850 a tonne caribbean and other traditional suppliers such as those in africa will have tarifffree access for the remainder of the ecs needs about 15m tonnes a year the latin americans who are the more costefficient producers wanted an open market but traditional suppliers to the ec mainly african and caribbean countries said that without protection their industries and some economies would be destroyed following the recent failure of germany and the benelux countries to have the new import regime overturned by the european court the continuing dispute now hinges on attempts by the latin americans to have a panel of the general agreement on tariffs and trade declare the regime untenable the immediate concern of the latin americans who shipped 24m tonnes of bananas to the ec last year appears to be what to do with the 400000 tonnes they will not now be able to ship latin american official have said they will lose about usdollars 1bn in export earnings over the next two years the new european regime means lower prices for bananas sold to the united states said mr calderon if latin america has 400000 tonnes left over after it is allowed to sell its quota to the european market and this goes to the us market then that will affect the price of the fruit which latin america sells to the united states mr compton maintained that the caribbean producers and others in the african caribbean and pacific group of countries which has a trade treaty with the ec were under attack from the gatt the latin american producers and the us companies involved in the latin american banana industry he said there were already signs of increasing quantities of dollar bananas as the latin american supplies are called in the european market and that that was depressing prices caribbean producers have tried with no apparent success to recruit the support of the us in the debate over the allocation of market shares the mood in the region is somewhat bitter mr edwin carrington the secretary general of caricom said there was concern in the region over the position of friendly countries such as the us that favoured the latin american arguments the region is clearly not convinced by statements made in washington a fortnight before the summit by ms donna hrinak the us deputy assistant secretary for inter american affairs that the us had not taken sides and was not supporting latin americans producers to the detriment of those in the caribbean the ec banana regime is inconsistent with the obligation which gatt members have and inconsistent with what we hope will be the outcome of the uruguay round which when completed will benefit all trading partners she said us officials at the caricom summit said washingtons position had not changed mr calderon forecast victory for the latin americans in their effort to win enough support at the gatt and morally oblige the europeans to negotiate with us although it is not our intention to harm in any way whatsoever the exports of caribbean countries there is no doubt that we in the caribbean support open trade and fully support the objectives of the uruguay round in gatt countered mr pj patterson jamaicas prime minister yet we must find the right balance that allows small exporters to find security in traditional markets
