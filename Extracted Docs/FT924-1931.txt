If your name is Simon Engineering and you need to borrow Pounds 50m then you may have to search around a bit . However , one name stands out in Simon's latest banking syndicate . Alongside Barclays , Lloyds and Bayerische Landesbank , is something called the Fifth Third Bank . Observer has heard of quite a few First National banks and even knows the address of the Second National Bank of Saginaw . But what is the Fifth Third bank ? Based in Cincinnati , where Simon has its US operation , it was formed in 1908 after the merger of the Fifth and Third National banks . It is by all accounts a first-rate outfit , albeit ranking 257th in the world bank pecking order . Even so , with a name like that it could be confused with the Bank of the Last Thirty Second .
