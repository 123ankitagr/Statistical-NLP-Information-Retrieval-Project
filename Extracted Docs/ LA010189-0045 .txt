we hear a lot of talk that if the united states were allowed to compete on an equal footing with foreign manufacturers our product quality and marketing skills would once again make us no 1 in the world well i offer for consideration the following true story i've protected the names of the manufacturers involved but any connoisseur of little chocolate doughnuts will recognize their identities brand x is recognized as the cadillac of little chocolate doughnuts light fresh with a chocolatey coating that is thick sweet oh-so-yummy most people's first choice but we don't always have a choice the micro-mini-market near me selling booze n munchies according to its sign carried only brand y heavy dry little chocolate doughnuts with a dark oil-slick coating that leaves you looking as if you've just been fingerprinted still when you wake up at the crack of noon needing little chocolate doughnuts to get your day started you take what you can get anyone who asks why i don't just go to the supermarket once a week and buy the valuepak of brand x little chocolate doughnuts should stop reading you've no understanding of the american consumer and will miss the point of the story one morning overcome by the urge for little chocolate doughnuts i walked into the booze n munchies store for a dose of brand y's lcds with a grimace i bit into one wham light fresh oh-so-yummy i looked at the package no new and improved no now with even more chocolatey goodness but yes they were good almost as good dare i think it as brand x i could purchase brand y little chocolate doughnuts proudly no longer afraid that others were looking upon me with scorn mommy he's buying brand y don't point junior some people aren't as fortunate as we are it was a wonderful day a month later the booze n munchies store was sold the new owner was behind the counter one morning as i bought my pack of brand y little chocolate doughnuts going to start getting brand x he said great although these have gotten a lot better he shrugged well now you'll have your choice you'll have your choice boy that's the american way sure enough a few days later there they were side-by-side brand x and brand y what a great moment it was being able to buy brand x little chocolate doughnuts the best little chocolate doughnuts only something strange hit me midway through my first pack of brand x little chocolate doughnuts in months i missed brand y had i grown accustomed to brand y's lower quality was brand x too rich for my blood the next day i held a taste test alternating a little chocolate doughnut from brand x with one from brand y after 12 little chocolate doughnuts i arrived at the startling conclusion brand y had surpassed brand x in chocolatey yumminess i switched back to brand y and i was happy for about two weeks one morning i stumbled into the b n m store for breakfast no brand y little chocolate doughnuts they weren't just out the entire rack was gone little chocolate doughnuts cupcakes wholesome snack pies everything the brand y people refused to be in the same store with brand x explained the owner said if i kept selling brand x they'd pull out but i like their little chocolate doughnuts better than brand x's i protested he shrugged love to sell both but brand x has the better name so i bought brand x don't get me wrong they were good but they weren't brand y next morning brand x was sold out distributor comes thursdays said the owner this was saturday after a little-chocolate-doughnutless weekend i went into the store monday there where once the brand y rack had stood was a rack of brand z products cupcakes wholesome snack pies and little chocolate doughnuts i bought a pack eeyew brand z little chocolate doughnuts are not as bad as the old brand y little chocolate doughnuts were but brand z little chocolate doughnuts as i'm sure you experts will agree simply have no taste they're only good for the desperate times when brand x is sold out which is usually the booze n munchies store gets its shipment of brand x little chocolate doughnuts every thursday by friday they're sold out i tell the guy every week to bring more shrugs the owner now the brand z guys they always make sure we're stocked using the booze n munchies store as our representative sample of the american market what have we learned brand x the brand with the best reputation ignores feedback and winds up selling a fraction what it could brand y the brand with the best product refuses to compete in an open market brand z the worst of the three is left to score the biggest sales now as i sit here munching yet another brand z little chocolate doughnut i can't help but wonder in the huge conglomerate headquarters of brand z's parent company just what language do you suppose they're speaking
