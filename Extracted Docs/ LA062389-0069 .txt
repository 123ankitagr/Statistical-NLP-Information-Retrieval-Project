The state Air Resources Board , after a daylong hearing in Los Angeles , delayed a vote on whether to approve a far-reaching plan by the South Coast Air Quality Management District to bring the Los Angeles Basin into compliance with the federal Clean Air Act by the year 2007 . The plan was approved last March by the AQMD board , but it must also be approved by the state and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency . The ARB appeared poised to approve the plan , even though it acknowledged that some air pollution controls proposed may not be enforceable , which would violate the federal Clean Air Act . At the same time , Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich repeated earlier criticisms that the plan is too costly and would eliminate thousands of jobs . But , David Howecamp , a top western regional official of the EPA , stressed the agency 's `` praise and firm support '' for the plan . The hearing is scheduled to resume today in the State Building downtown at 107 S. Broadway at 10 a.m. and a vote is expected at the hearing 's conclusion .
