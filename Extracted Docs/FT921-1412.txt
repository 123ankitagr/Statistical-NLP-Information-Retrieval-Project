the group of pro-labour scientists who wrote to the times yesterday were stretching a point between 1974 and 1979, they said british scientists won six nobel prizes in 1980-85 the number dropped to four and for 1986-91 there was just one british laureate about the long-term trend they may well be right but there is a time lag in these matters and it is surely pushing it a bit to claim the number of prizes between 1974-79 as a triumph for the labour government of that period most nobel prizes are based on research done five to 20 years previously though the interval between a discovery and its recognition by the nobel committee varies enormously cesar milstein of the laboratory of molecular biology in cambridge discovered monoclonal antibodies a key development in molecular biology in 1976 and won a nobel prize in 1984, which was fast by nobel standards on the other hand peyton rous discovered in 1911 that viruses can cause cancer he won the prize in 1966 perhaps the scientists who did their best work in the thatcher period will get their reward by the millennium
