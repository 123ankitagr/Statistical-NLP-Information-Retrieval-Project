when a russianbuilt tupolev aircraft of china northwest airlines crashed near the historic city of xian in june it was not only chinas worst air disaster it also coincided with festering doubts about beijings ability to manage its flourishing aviation sector an appalling safety record more than 500 people have died in air crashes since 1992 had turned the spotlight on lax safety standards poor maintenance sloppy cabin service and virtually nonexistent airport security in the past year or so there have been no fewer than a dozen hijackings to taiwan of chinese airliners since the appointment late last year of mr chen guangyi as head of the civil aviation administration of china caac the countrys aviation regulatory arm efforts have intensified to improve safety but foreign airline representatives say that china has a long way to go before it can hope to match international standards chinas aviation sector simply has grown too fast for available resources pilot training for example is lagging well behind demand among the most critical problems is a lack of experienced pilots china is moving to redress the problem in cooperation with foreign airlines such as lufthansa which has agreed to train chinese pilots at its facility in phoenix arizona but demand is such that it will take years to provide an adequate supply of pilots growth figures for the aviation sector are staggering passenger numbers are rising at an average of 20 per cent annually and this is expected to continue for the next few years although a credit squeeze slowed the increase last year to 168 per cent from 33 per cent the year before projected chinese purchases of passenger aircraft should be enough to keep airbus industries and boeing in business well into next century in a study for an air finance conference chase manhattan bank predicts chinas passenger fleet of 350 aircraft will increase fivefold by 2010 this would require the purchase of 1200 new aircraft worth usdollars 90bn chases prediction compares with less optimistic forecasts by among others boeing which predicts purchases of 800 aircraft and expenditure of udollars 40bn airbus expects china to purchase 620 new aircraft in the next 15 years regardless of who is correct numbers of aircraft and amounts of money involved are colossal growth in the civil aviation fleet since china began opening to the world in the late 1970s has been spectacular in 1974 china had just 12 passenger aircraft compared with the 350 today boeing followed by airbus and mcdonnell douglas have been the chief beneficiaries boeing delivered 46 airliners to china last year 14 per cent of its production this year it expects to deliver 36 or 14 per cent of a lower production negotiations are also well advanced for the purchase of a further 50 boeings including the new 777 twoengined widebody at a cost of about udollars 5bn airbus too is making a stronger showing in the china market the european consortium secured orders last year worth udollars 12bn three airlines china eastern in shanghai china northwest in xian and china northern in shenyang are now operating airbus other suppliers of aviation equipment are also benefiting from chinas aviation expansion rollsroyce for example is supplying 42 of its rb211535 engines for boeing 757s on order by chinese airlines and is expecting further orders while china is spending billions of dollars on the purchase of new topoftherange aircraft it is far from maximising returns on investment the chase manhattan study reported that chinas average aircraft utilisation rate was 52 hours a day in 1992 up from 47 the year before this compares with 11 for singapore airlines among factors curtailing utilisation is the primitive state of chinese infrastructure including airports and air traffic control systems only 40 of chinas airports have instrumentlanding systems which means that bad weather often causes delays and thus disruption to the entire network a striking feature has been the proliferation of new regional operators china now has more than 30 airlines this regionalisation of the aviation sector has placed a huge burden on caacs overstretched regulatory abilities on the other hand the growth of regional carriers has added a dynamic to the sector which would not have been possible if the caac monopoly had been maintained the regional airlines are also spreading their wings beyond china opening routes to international destinations such as singapore and thailand several are seeking capital abroad to fund ambitious expansion plans china southern based in guangzhou and china eastern are among 22 chinese companies approved for listing on overseas stock markets in its efforts to secure expertise and capital china recently announced it was opening its airline industry to foreign investment though foreign involvement in a mainland airline would be restric ted to 35 per cent with voting rights capped at 25 per cent foreign investors were also being urged to invest in airport facilities such as terminals groundhandling and aircraft maintenance indeed foreign carriers are already becoming more involved british airways recently formed a joint engineering venture with china southern lufthansa has a joint venture maintenance facility in beijing with air china and singapore airlines has concluded a jointventure agreement with the beijing airport authority for inflight kitchen services and ground handling facilities chinas aviation sector is in flux and the learning curve is proving to be steep
