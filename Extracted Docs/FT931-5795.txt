us scientists have identified the rogue immune cells that are responsible for multiple sclerosis the discovery by stanford university researchers working with neurocrine biosciences a san diego-based biotechnology company could lead eventually to a cure for ms which afflicts more than 2.6 m people worldwide although ms has been the subject of intensive research activity worldwide there is still no effective treatment for the disease in which the body's immune system attacks the protective coating of myelin protein around nerve fibres this results in progressive paralysis the researchers report in the journal nature today that they have identified the specific type of white blood cell t-cell responsible for the attack and matched its genetic sequence to a corresponding gene on the myelin protein by good fortune it turns out that the same genetic sequence causes ms in rats having an animal model always speeds up drug development lawrence steinman leader of the stanford neurocrine research team says the scientists are following three approaches the primary effort is to make a molecular decoy which can attract the t-cells away from the myelin clinical trials of the first candidate could start next year antibodies or other molecules could be developed to remove or inactivate the t-cells a vaccine could disable the t-cells all three methods focus on blocking or disabling the very specific immune response that causes this disease without suppressing the patient's entire immune system steinman says once a blocking technique has been developed it may eventually become possible to use growth factors to repair the damaged tissues in ms patients but the ultimate cause of ms what triggers the t-cells to attack is not yet understood one theory is that fragments of viruses mimic parts of the myelin molecule and trigger auto-immunity
