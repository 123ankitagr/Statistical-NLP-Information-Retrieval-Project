Japan reaffirmed its close co-operation with South Korea on solving the North Korean nuclear dispute during a weekend meeting between the two countries ' leaders in Seoul . The visit by Mr Tomiichi Murayama , the new Japanese prime minister , was meant to calm worries in South Korea that his position as leader of the Japanese Social Democratic party , which has supported North Korea , would affect relations with Seoul . He urged North Korea to abandon its nuclear programme and end its isolation . Mr Murayama promised that Japan would not pursue diplomatic relations with North Korea until suspicions about its nuclear programme were removed . Tokyo would also consult Seoul on any negotiations Pyongyang . Japan is willing to provide financial assistance for the supply of safe light-water nuclear reactors to North Korea once the nuclear issue is solved , Mr Murayama said . In an attempt to improve relations with Seoul , Mr Murayama repeated recent apologies by Japan over Tokyo 's harsh colonial rule of Korea between 1910 and 1945 . The new Japanese government has offered to spend Dollars 1bn ( Pounds 645m ) on programmes to improve ties with South Korea , as compensation for the forced recruitment of Korean women as military prostitutes during the second world war . But South Korea appeared to be cautious about the proposal , indicating instead that it favoured direct payments by Japan to the women . President Kim Young-sam asked that Japan also take measures to reduce Seoul 's trade deficit with Tokyo , which is expected to increase to Dollars 10bn this year from Dollars 8.5bn in 1993 because of the strong yen .
