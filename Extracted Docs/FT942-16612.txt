The Japanese government yesterday gave an uncharacteristically strong response to North Korean claims that Japan was set to develop nuclear weapons . It said statements from Pyongyang that possible North Korean development of nuclear weapons was meant to restrain Tokyo from developing such weapons were 'nothing but malicious propaganda ' . A North Korean news agency had claimed the recent start-up of Monju , a nuclear facility in western Japan , indicated that Tokyo was preparing to develop nuclear weapons . 'It is out of the question for Japan to develop nuclear weapons . Japan's firm support of the indefinite extension of the non-proliferation treaty , of which it is a member as a non-nuclear weapon state , is another clear indication that Japan has no intention of developing nuclear weapons , ' the Foreign Ministry said . 'North Korea , which has not yet accepted the International Atomic Energy Agency 's full inspections , is not in a position to criticise Japan 's nuclear policy . North Korea should know that this sort of propaganda does not justify its own behaviour . ' The belated statement from the ministry , issued two days after the North Korean claims were made , reflects the difficulty the authorities in Tokyo have had in responding to increased tensions on the Korean peninsula . The ministry 's rebuke is in contrast to the generally muted response from Tokyo . Concern that a critical Japanese tone could aggravate the tensions has led the authorities to make generally low-key public statements on the issue . However , Japan wants to make clear that it has no intention of developing nuclear weapons . The government is likely to be anxious not to give North Korea an excuse to play on historical Korean fears of Japanese aggression and thus to justify its development of nuclear weapons as a defensive measure .
