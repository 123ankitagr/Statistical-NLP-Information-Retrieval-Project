pacific bell said wednesday that 112000 rural customers who were charged extra for pushbutton telephone service that the company never provided will receive credits averaging $ 42 on their phone bills this fall the credits stem from a $ 5million settlement the california public utilities commission approved last week in a closeddoor executive session the settlement culminated a threeyear effort by george sawaya of rural pollock pines in the sierra foothills east of sacramento who said he was induced by a pacific bell mailing to sign up at extra cost for touch tone service so his calls would be completed faster he noticed no difference in service however and later learned that pacific bells local telephone switch was not equipped to provide the service although he obtained an immediate refund sawaya filed a classaction complaint on behalf of other customers who paid extra for service that was never provided pacific bell spokeswoman kathleen flynn said the company expects to submit details of the refund plan this month she called the billing problems an oversight puc deputy counsel michael day said the commission considered pacific bells action an unintended mistake stemming from commissionapproved rate changes intended to compensate the company for upgrading its switching equipment throughout much of the state
