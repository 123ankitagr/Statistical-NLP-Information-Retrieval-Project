Pacific Bell said Wednesday that 112,000 rural customers who were charged extra for push-button telephone service that the company never provided will receive credits averaging $ 42 on their phone bills this fall . The credits stem from a $ 5-million settlement the California Public Utilities Commission approved last week in a closed-door `` executive session . '' The settlement culminated a three-year effort by George Sawaya of rural Pollock Pines in the Sierra foothills east of Sacramento , who said he was induced by a Pacific Bell mailing to sign up , at extra cost , for `` Touch Tone '' service so his calls would be completed faster . He noticed no difference in service , however , and later learned that Pacific Bell 's local telephone switch was not equipped to provide the service . Although he obtained an immediate refund , Sawaya filed a class-action complaint on behalf of other customers who paid extra for service that was never provided . Pacific Bell spokeswoman Kathleen Flynn said the company expects to submit details of the refund plan this month . She called the billing problems `` an oversight . '' PUC Deputy Counsel Michael Day said the commission considered Pacific Bell 's action an unintended mistake stemming from commission-approved rate changes intended to compensate the company for upgrading its switching equipment throughout much of the state .
