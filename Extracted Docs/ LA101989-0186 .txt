Granting 3 % salary raises to nearly all city employees , the City Council on Tuesday adopted changes in job qualifications for about 100 positions in city hall and in the Capistrano Valley Water District . The changes in most cases resulted in upgrading job requirements , with a corresponding increase in salary level that did not cause any employees to lose pay , Assistant City Manager George Scarborough explained . City job descriptions are reviewed every five years for accuracy and are updated to incorporate additional duties and responsibilities performed by the employee , Scarborough said . The first version of revised job descriptions was presented to city employees three months ago and 33 descriptions were challenged in an appeal process . The contested positions were amended according to the employees ' testimony , Scarborough said . The city employs 80 people and the water district , whose board of directors is the City Council , employs 23 people .
