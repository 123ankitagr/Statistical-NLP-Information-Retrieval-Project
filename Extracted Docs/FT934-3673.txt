companies partly responsible for their own loss from a breach of contract should have their damages reduced accordingly the law commission the government's law reform body said yesterday it called for a change in the law to allow courts to apportion damages for breach of contract where both parties were at fault groups that have pressed for reform include the 1989 jack committee on banking services law the auditors study team on professional liability and the auditing practices board the commission said such groups are concerned that under present law where one party is in breach of contract and the other is also to blame the winner takes all contract law contrasts with the law of negligence where contributory negligence results in a reduction of damages the commission says the present law is fair where a defendant is subject to a strict contractual duty such as the obligation on a shopkeeper to supply goods of merchantable quality and that therefore a particular outcome is guaranteed regardless of fault but it says where a defendant has agreed only to take reasonable care it is unfair to assume he has undertaken to compensate the injured party where he has contributed to his own loss it recommends a change in the law to enable courts to apportion damages for breach of a contractual duty to take reasonable care or exercise reasonable skill where the plaintiff has failed to take reasonable care of his interests it accepts however that parties should still be able to contract to apportion risk and so be free to exclude the apportionment rule this will safeguard the ability of businesses to allocate risk with certainty it says contributory negligence as a defence in contract law com no 219 hmso pounds 9.95
