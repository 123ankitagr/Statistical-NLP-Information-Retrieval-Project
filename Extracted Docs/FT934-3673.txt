Companies partly responsible for their own loss from a breach of contract should have their damages reduced accordingly , the Law Commission , the government 's law reform body , said yesterday . It called for a change in the law to allow courts to apportion damages for breach of contract where both parties were at fault . Groups that have pressed for reform include the 1989 Jack Committee on Banking Services Law , the Auditors Study Team on Professional Liability and the Auditing Practices Board , the commission said . Such groups are concerned that under present law , where one party is in breach of contract and the other is also to blame , the winner takes all . Contract law contrasts with the law of negligence where contributory negligence results in a reduction of damages . The commission says the present law is fair where a defendant is subject to a 'strict ' contractual duty , such as the obligation on a shopkeeper to supply goods of 'merchantable quality ' and that therefore a particular outcome is guaranteed , regardless of fault . But it says where a defendant has agreed only to take reasonable care it is unfair to assume he has undertaken to compensate the injured party where he has contributed to his own loss . It recommends a change in the law to enable courts to apportion damages for breach of a contractual duty to take reasonable care , or exercise reasonable skill , where the plaintiff has failed to take reasonable care of his interests . It accepts , however , that parties should still be able to contract to apportion risk , and so be free to exclude the apportionment rule . This will safeguard the ability of businesses to allocate risk with certainty , it says . Contributory Negligence as a Defence in Contract , Law Com No . 219 . HMSO . Pounds 9.95 .
