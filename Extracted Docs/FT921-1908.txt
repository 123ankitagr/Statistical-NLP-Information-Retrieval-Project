out of the desert the mirage arose one night there was a vast empty lot next day on this shimmering crossroads marked by a thousand points of glitz appeared the most dazzling structure the las vegas strip had ever seen its what god would have done steve wynn liked to quip adding irreverently if hed had the money wynn had another oneliner which went down well with business audiences what do you do when you owe the bank dollars 500m and on the first day of the month you cant meet the interest charges pause absolutely nothing in reality wynns dream of a casino took three years to build but it went up so fast it did seem like a mirage he is a showman first and a businessman second albeit an operator who staked more than anyone had ever risked before in building a casinohotel it cost dollars 620m when it opened in november 1989 and that was just for starters donald trump had also coveted the site but wynn turned him down they were friends but not really friendly trump in a stinging phrase which wynns wife elaine has never forgiven once accused steve of being a classic underachiever the donald as his wife ivana liked to call him was left to build his own dream of a casino in atlantic city new jersey it was called the taj mahal and was billed with characteristic hype as the eighth wonder of the world the contrast between these two places the mirage and and the taj mahal is the story of casino gambling in the 1990s in effect a longrange duel across the tables between the two main personalities in the gaming industry wynn out west and trump out east rivalry is not perhaps the right word although one man has emerged as leader of the gaming industry and the others main casino is in chapter 11 bankruptcy because wynn himself has never seen their competition in personal terms the two men share a flamboyance of character but their approach to casino gambling which has set the style in their opposing resorts has been radically different wynn is glossy lively funny mercurial fasttalking harddriving a man who has lived gambling since his boyhood since the day i took my first breath i have been a kid who has never had a meal a dollar for tuition or a piece of clothing on my back that didnt come from gambling he claims on his first visit to vegas as a 10yearold he was dazzled by its glamour unfortunately his father had a weakness for the dice and went broke it was a useful lesson if you wan na make money in a casino wynn says in a classic formulation own one the mirage is his answer the opening was a local affair the whole town was agog to see the inside of the place long lines of people waiting in the sun pressed against the green cordon of security guards at five to noon the line buckled and at five past the place was jammed the people poured in baseball caps bobbing bomber jackets billowing tshirts flapping over dayglo bermudas trainers thudding below pale pink pants and blue jeans the whole rag tag and bobtail of a holiday crowd on the spree no one had ever opened a casino of this supercolossal size before snap just like that all of a sudden the air was filled with noise the slots were whirring and chunking line after line of them the coins rattling around like sea shells in the tide this heavymetal rhythm was overscored by a sort of moaning sirenlike scream from a bank of superslots shouts greetings laughter and above it all snatches of rock music loudspeaker anouncements bells ringing metal clashing the sweet sound as it has proved month after month of success overnight the mirage became the focus of the las vegas strip on a basic yshape of three towers 30 storeys high it contains 3000 suites and rooms in front a homemade volcano erupts into the night sky every 15 minutes inside a tropical rain forest under a glass atrium leads guests into the casino glittering lightanddark behind a glass wall roam white tigers by the lagoon cavort dolphins its kitsch its over the top its fun the mirage won over dollars 409m from gaming and made dollars 251m from hotel and other income in its first year an unparalleled success the operation needed to generate income of this magnitude because it has to make more than dollars 1m a day simply to meet its interest and running costs wynn is not under any illusions about the task ahead we dare not stand still he says its exhilarating like driving a racing car at high speed but another bend is always coming up to meet you trump by contrast lacked that intuitive feel for casinos that comes from a lifetime in gaming his whole experience was in real estate which is certainly a big risk but of a completely different kind what attracted him to gaming was the apparently amazing cash flow of casinos when trump nosing around atlantic city late in the 80s finally acquired his first property trump plaza and then a second one trump castle putting ivana in charge it looked an exciting prospect and indeed it might have turned out well enough given the drabness of the place and new jerseys constraints on gaming if trump had not fallen for another project an extravaganza to outdo all other casinos the taj mahal which was supposed to demonstrate the art of the deal was an unknown quantity its costs were out of control the market was already oversold by the time it was completed it had cost the best part of dollars 1000m but if steve could do it in vegas spending all that money then donald was determined he could show them in atlantic city a banner went up at the entrance to town for the grand opening of the taj in april 1990 more than a mirage the taj mahal is big certainly its 90 minarets shine out over the ocean like coloured onion domes the casino bright with indian motifs and decoration covers 120000 sq ft its serried ranks of slot machines like a painted metal army rooted to the drill square stretch out on all sides under viennese chandeliers it drew the crowds trumps affair with film starlet marla maples had made him a media celebrity but the operation was ramshackle the times too were changing within three months of its glorifed opening trump was locked in a struggle with the banks to meet his various interest payments in its first full year of operation the taj reported losses of dollars 120m atlantic city suffers compared with las vegas because it is not a destination resort people go to vegas for vacations and trade conventions the gambling has become only a part albeit by far the most lucrative part of a shiny package which includes shows boxing sports high action and fast women at a cut price it is hard to see why anyone should want to go to atlantic city especially in winter what now atlantic city might pull through at a reduced level there are too many casinos chasing too few customers the taj with one of wynns former managers in charge is doing better it earned dollars 29m this january no mean feat but still below par as anyone can see who visits the place it is essentially a decorated shed blown up to mammoth size its only message is big is beautiful the mirage too will find competition tougher in the recession but the joint is still jumping night after night aware of the need to fight for family appeal wynn is now planning to build a new casino treasure island on 17 acres of the present mirage parking site at a startup cost of dollars 300m launching the project wynn appeared in a pirates hat
