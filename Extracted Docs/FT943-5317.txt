Every so often the cinema has a nostalgia spree . Spurred by all those fans who say 'They do n't make them like they used to ' , it rolls up its sleeves and tries to do so . Last week we had The Hudsucker Proxy : a sort of self-assembly Frank Capra comedy from the makers of Barton Fink . This week Wyatt Earp sprawls across the land , three hours of Kevin Costner trying to rebuild the Western ( even though hostile American critics tried to gun him down ) . And in the better-received but still backward-looking When A Man Loves A Woman , Andy Garcia and Meg ( Sleepless In Seattle ) Ryan try to put the angst back into the romantic weepie . Like the song lyricists , Hollywood knows that September rhymes with remember . But if you want to skip the repro Golden Age , you could always go for the real thing . A sparkling print of Michael Powell 's 1940s here-and-beyond fantasy A Matter Of Life And Death - David Niven and Deborah Kerr reaching out to each other across the heavens - is on at London's Barbican . And the Riverside Studios have a marvellous Jean Renoir double bill . The lyrical Partie De Campagne - like an Auguste Renoir landscape come to life - makes a high-contrast pairing with the black comedy Le Crime De Monsieur Lange . For once , the new video releases seem more up-to-date than the new movies . Check your stockist now or soon for Robert Altman 's unmissable epic of inter-tangling lives , Short Cuts : the strong cast of which ( Lemmon , Robbins , Tomlin , McDowell .. ) draws Chekhovian patterns across Los Angeles . Robert De Niro 's directing debut A Bronx Tale is a lively if sermon-prone tale of Italian-American growing up . And for a foolish treat try El Mariachi , a Mexican comedy-Western which conquered the world 's festival circuit earlier this year and had Hollywood scrambling to sign its director for an English-language remake .
