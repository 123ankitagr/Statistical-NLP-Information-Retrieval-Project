Millions of Eastern Europeans celebrated their first free Christmas in four decades : political prisoners rejoined their families , East Germans and Czechoslovaks watched Mass on TV and Romanians listened to long-banned carols on state radio . Crowds milled around Berlin 's newly reopened Brandenburg Gate , symbol of the division of both Germany and Europe . East Germans also watched their first Mass on television , as Pope John Paul II delivered his traditional Christmas message in 53 languages from St. Peter 's Square in Rome . Many of his remarks were aimed at Eastern Europe . Church bells pealed across Czechoslovakia to mark the new freedoms won in a pro-democracy movement that toppled Communist leaders . `` I feel like this is a miracle , '' said Ivan M. Jirous , 45 , who was reunited with his family after being imprisoned for more than eight years for `` subversive '' acts . On Prague 's 15th-Century Charles Bridge , young carolers sang haunting , traditional Christmas melodies . In previous years , police chased carolers from the broad , cobbled King 's Road . Amid the sounds of gunfire on the streets of Bucharest were the sounds of Christmas songs and carols , broadcast by Radio Bucharest for the first time since the Communist takeover of Romania in December , 1947 . The Soviet Union 's Baltic republics enjoyed the first official Christmas holiday allowed by the Communists . And in Bethlehem , Christians from around the world prayed at the site of Jesus ' birth , but it was a subdued Christmas overshadowed by the two-year-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories .
