Fresh evidence of recovery in business and leisure travel came yesterday with annual traffic figures showing UK airports handled a record number of people last year . BAA , the airports group , said passenger numbers at its seven airports , including London Heathrow and Gatwick , increased 5 per cent last year compared with 1992 to a record 80.8m . This followed a 6.6 per cent increase last month over the same month in 1992 when the seven airports handled 5.7m passengers . Heathrow saw passenger numbers rise 5.9 per cent to 47.6m last year , while traffic at Gatwick grew only 1.1 per cent to 20m . This reflects the change in the London air traffic distribution rules which has led to several international airlines switching to Heathrow . Traffic at Stansted increased 14.5 per cent to 2.7m passengers last year , while the number at Glasgow rose 7.4 per cent to pass the 5m mark for the first time . Last month Stansted recorded the strongest growth of 24 per cent compared with December 1992 . Overall traffic on UK domestic routes rose by 6.4 per cent last month over December 1992 , while the charter market was 7.2 per cent higher . North Atlantic traffic rose 4 per cent last month while other long-haul traffic rose 12.4 per cent .
