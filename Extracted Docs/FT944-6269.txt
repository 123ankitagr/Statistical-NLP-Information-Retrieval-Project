the chancellor yesterday fulfilled his commitment to a 3 per cent real increase in tax on tobacco to support the governments aim of reducing smoking from 6pm last night tax on each packet of 20 cigarettes rose by 10p and the chancellor promised that duty on other tobacco products would rise by a similar proportion however the tax on beer table wine and spirits was left unchanged as the chancellor responded to complaints from the drinks industry about duties and the increase in crosschannel shopping and smuggling the chancellor reduced the duty on fortified wine by 13p per bottle and on sparkling wine by 27p to bring the two duties into line with each other mr kenneth clarkes action on beer was largely expected as a treasury select committee last week rejected a call by brewers for beer duty to be halved to curb crosschannel imports in his speech mr clarke said crossborder shopping and smuggling had meant a loss of duty to the exchequer he said that no chancellor can remain unmoved in the face of this but neither can any chancellor simply adopt popular measures to cut taxes on alcohol that would threaten the revenue
