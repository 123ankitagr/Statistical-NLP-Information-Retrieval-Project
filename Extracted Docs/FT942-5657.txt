sir thomas mayer personal view june 1 is right to warn of the dangers of excessive growth in german m3 and public borrowing but he overstates the case mr mayer compares m3 growth of 46 per cent between 1989 and 1993 with real gross domestic product growth of 19 per cent giving an implied money overhang of 27 per cent however the appropriate comparison is with nominal gdp which grew by more than 39 per cent in other words past inflation has already absorbed much of the excessive m3 growth leaving an overhang of only about 7 per cent he notes that at the end of this year public debt will be 115 per cent higher than at the end of 1989 this overstates the upward trend in public borrowing because it includes existing gdr net debt which we estimate at dm450bn or 485 per cent of the level of public debt in 1989 mr mayer rightly warns that credit is expanding faster than investment but he overstates the problem by citing the 4 per cent fall in equipment investment between 1989 and 1993 most investment has recently been concentrated in construction especially desperately needed housing including this nominal investment rose 26 per cent in the west during that period the figure would be higher still if we add in investment in the east there should be no question of the bundesbanks abandoning the m3 target its current rapid growth and the surge in credit provide a signal of potential risks ahead but those risks should not be exaggerated michael clauss vicepresident cs first boston gruneburgweg 102 d60323 frankfurt germany
