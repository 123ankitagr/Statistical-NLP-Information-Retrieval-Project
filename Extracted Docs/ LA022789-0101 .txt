Former Mayor Mike Boyle , ousted in a 1987 recall election , announced today that he will run again for the city 's top job . In announcing his candidacy , Boyle said he decided to run because he loves politics and public service and because a surprisingly large number of people urged him to enter the race . Boyle , 45 , was elected mayor in 1981 and reelected in 1985 . But opponents began gathering petition signatures shortly after his second term started . They accused Boyle of abusing his power , meddling in police affairs , being soft on drunken driving and being disrespectful , citing an incident in which he allegedly threw pats of butter during a dinner-table argument .
