the us will hold its team spirit military exercise in south korea some time in november if north korea continues to refuse full international nuclear inspections the decision was announced yesterday after talks in seoul between mr william perry the us defence secretary and south korean officials the military exercise which involves extensive ground manoeuvres cannot be held earlier because it would disrupt planting and harvesting activities in farming areas according to south korean officials however the late schedule for team spirit which is normally held in the spring could weaken its use as a negotiating tactic to pressure north korea to allow nuclear inspections the us has offered to suspend team spirit if north korea permits nuclear inspections to proceed but the international atomic energy agency wants to conduct the inspections by early next month north korea has repeatedly protested against the staging of the exercises which have been held almost annually since 1976, as a provocative act that would raise tensions on the korean peninsula analysts believe that the us may use this year's team spirit if it is conducted as a means to stockpile more us military equipment in south korea mr perry said that the us and south korea had agreed to improve their defence preparations through the deployment of new equipment such as patriot anti-missile batteries apache attack helicopters and mobile missile early-warning systems the us is also asking south korea to purchase artillery targeting systems that would spot the location of thousands of north korean artillery batteries along the demilitarised zone but mr perry emphasised that there is no imminent danger of a military confrontation and explained the military build-up was a precautionary measure
