for his party trick simon willcock will copy your credit cards with a device twice the size of a mechanical card reader he transfers the data on the magnetic strip from one card to another his box of tricks is made of perspex so that you can see it contains nothing more exotic than some taperecorder heads and simple electronic circuits with more sophisticated equipment willcock can show you just what data sits in the magnetic strip on your card mostly it is a seemingly meaningless sequence of numbers and letters in three parallel recording channels willcock does not counterfeit cards for a living he wipes clean any copies he makes with a powerful magnet he does it to demonstrate the vulnerability of conventional credit cards the party trick is part of a demonstration put on by the central research laboratory of thorn emi where willcock heads the magnetics division crl has a vested interest in raising doubts about the security of credit cards it has developed a technology that it claims makes it impossible to duplicate cards the watermark magnetics technology socalled because it leaves a permanent fingerprint and is as hard to copy as the watermark in paper is a growing business for thorn secure science international tssi as credit card fraud grows more and more banks are turning to the company for its copyproof magnetic strip since adopting watermark in the mid1980s banks in sweden have seen the disappearance of phantom withdrawals where money goes missing from an account despite customers claims that they did not use their cards tssi has just announced the first uk trial with standard visa payment cards this will involve 30000 cardholders in the northampton area the korean phone card company has used watermark since the seoul olympics in 1988 crls technology also uses a magnetic strip but one with a fourth recording channel this channel is different magnetically from the conventional recorded strips that make up the other three channels it contains hard data that can not be erased or copied whatever you do you cant get rid of it says willcock watermarks fourth track carries data that is unique to each card just as a paper watermark is written into the fibres of the paper so crls magnetic mark is embedded in the strips magnetic domains unlike the domains of a recording tape which point along the tape the domains in crls stripe its magnetic particles are at 45 degrees to the tape the magnetic domains in one length of tape can point in one of two directions with some particles pointing one way while particles in other stretches of the tape are at 90 degrees to them a specially designed tape reader can detect where the strip goes from one direction to the other by arranging these short stretches in a predetermined way the tapemaker is effectively creating a special pattern that shows up as a unique sequence of numbers and letters from its production plant in swindon tssi delivers to its customers tapes with an agreed security sequence the cardmaker then puts the strip on to a plastic card by checking for the watermark an automated cash machine can confirm that the card is present with a conventional credit card there is always some doubt about this the users personal identification number pin is supposed to verify this but with cards so easy to copy customers can argue that a transaction had nothing to do with their card while credit cards are an important market for crls technology it has also found a role in security systems the ministry of defence already employs it in its central headquarters office technology system before gaining access to the mods electronic mail users have to insert their watermarked cards and those cards have to stay in place throughout the session a further use is in prepaid cards for phone calls and transport systems for example here the risk of duplication is considerable as it is in cards used for gaming machines australian casinos have adopted watermark cards for this application if watermark technology is so secure why has it not caught on after all it adds just a few pence to the cost of a card the true costs of adopting a new technology are those of changing business systems in installing new reading machines and registering the issue and numbers of magnetically protected cards financial institutions issue more than a billion cards each year for financial transactions alone on the other side of the balance sheet fraud is a growing problem for banks they are looking for ways of reducing their losses alternatives to watermarks hard strip include smart cards with electronic chips that hold large amounts of data while smart cards can also reduce fraud thorn emi maintains that they are no more secure than its magnetic stripe and are considerably dearer the company forecasts a growing demand for its system it has issued magnetic strips for more than 500m cards and now makes about 70m a year
