Since ITV is supposed to be a virtually new channel and the BBC is said to be fighting for its life , there is a remarkable lack of new thinking in this evening 's television schedules . At 6.00 BBC2 shows a repeat of Stingray , the puppet series which first appeared in 1965 . That is followed at 6.25 by a repeat of The Man From UNCLE , the spoof special-agent series which began in the same year . Then , at 7.15 , comes a repeat of Doctor Who which started two years earlier . At 8.00 BBC1 offers a repeat of All Creatures Great And Small , the series about a vet in the Yorkshire Dales which first appeared in 1977 . And at 9.00 ITV weighs in with the first episode in a new series of Doctor Finlay , the drama about a Scottish country doctor which was launched , as 'Dr Finlay 's Casebook ' , by the BBC in 1962 . The new series picks up the threads at the end of the Second World War . It sounds like a night for a long soak in the bath and a good read ; Joanna Trollope 's 'The Choir ' is classy escapism . You could listen simultaneously to Haydn 's Symphony No 90 and Beethoven 's 8th in Orchestra Of The Age Of Enlightenment ( 9.45 Radio 3 ) .
