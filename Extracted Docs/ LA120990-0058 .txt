Before you even consider using your home as a financial backstop , you 'll want to have a firm grasp on how much you spend each month . To do that , visit your local stationery or business-supply store and purchase a `` personal expense work sheet '' or similar fill-in-the-blanks form that asks you to detail exactly how much money you spend each month and -- equally important -- how you spend it . `` Take a hard look at all the expenses you have today , and decide which ones can be eliminated , '' said financial planner Jack Blankinship . `` Do you really need a gardener , a pool cleaner or a maid to come in several times a month ? Do you need to dine out as often as you do now ? `` If you think you might lose your job , eliminate these expenses now and start putting the money you 'll save in the bank . If you eventually wind up out of work , you 'll be able to tap your savings to make your mortgage payment or to pay other bills . '' If you seriously think that the future of your job is in jeopardy , you might also want to go out now and pick up a second job or do some free-lance work to supplement your income . `` Put your extra earnings in a money market fund or some other type of safe investment , and only tap it if you need to , '' he said . `` Also start getting those resumes out , '' said Dwain Greer , executive vice president of banking giant Shearson Lehman Mortgage Corp. `` Do n't wait until you get a pink slip before you start looking for a new job -- start looking for one now . '' Also tally up your total assets . If you fall on hard times , many financial experts say that you should sell your stocks , bonds , mutual-fund shares and the like before you tap the equity in your home . Do n't forget other possible sources of cash . Perhaps you have some jewelry , furs , a boat or an extra car that can be sold to raise money or lower your monthly debt burden . Life-insurance policies and annuities can often be cashed in or borrowed against at unusually low interest rates . It might even make sense to withdraw money from your retirement account , although you might suffer a nasty tax bite . Also consider consolidating your debts . `` You might be able to save some money by taking out one big loan and paying off all your high-interest credit-cards and other debts , '' said banker Greer . Greer said the rate you pay on the bill consolidation loan will probably be much lower than the rate you pay on your credit cards . That would lower your monthly finance charges . In addition , bill consolidation loans -- unlike some auto loans , credit card bills and many other types of debt -- are usually paid back over several years . `` By stringing your debt out over a longer period of time , you 'll lower your overall monthly payments , '' Greer said .
