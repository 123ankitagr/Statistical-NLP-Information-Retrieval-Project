a former federal drug agent on thursday told jurors in graphic detail how he and two other agents went on a crime spree over several years in which they stole drugs and cash from dealers stash houses and even from the drug enforcement agency's los angeles headquarters so audacious was the scheme which netted them millions of dollars in drug profits that the former agent john anthony jackson testified that he cut stolen cocaine for illegal street sales at night in the dea's offices in the world trade center downtown jackson is a key government witness in the dea corruption trial of former agent darnell garcia 43, of rancho palos verdes who is charged with drug trafficking money laundering and conveying intelligence information to a fugitive drug dealer jackson accused his fellow agent of participating with him in a wide range of crimes between 1983 and 1988, including breaking into a pasadena garage where they ripped off a colombian drug cache of 180 kilos of cocaine worth a potential 36 million in street sales orchestrating diversions at dea headquarters to steal drugs from the agency's evidence vault and almost 100,000 in drug money from a nearby cashier's office instructing jackson and another agent how to hide their drug profits in secret swiss bank accounts and harboring drug fugitives in garcia's apartment in bunker hill towers downtown jackson's daylong testimony provided moments of high drama in the second week of a trial growing out of the dea's worst corruption scandal under rapid-fire questioning from assistant u s atty joyce karlan he described a series of drug thefts that quickly made the agents millionaires neither jackson nor garcia showed outward emotion jackson looked at his former colleague only once when u s district judge terry j hatter jr asked him to identify the defendant during a recess jackson 41, of claremont shook hands and hugged other dea agents in the court corridor who had come to see him testify responding to reporters questions he suggested that garcia's chances of being acquitted were slim he should have gotten off the titanic when it first started going down jackson said referring to the government investigation that resulted in the 1988 indictment of the three agents as evidence mounted against the three jackson and the third agent wayne countryman 47, of walnut pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges last august the two were told by prosecutors they might receive reduced prison sentences jackson 15 years countryman seven years if they cooperated and testified against garcia who has steadfastly maintained his innocence jackson a stocky man known as j j among his associates said he harbored no animosity toward garcia of his stinging testimony jackson told reporters garcia knew that he jackson was doing what he had to do he knows that's the way the cookie crumbles jackson said but if garcia and jackson kept their cool some dea agents in the courtroom audience had difficulty controlling their emotions toward their colleagues predicament it really really hurts to see someone who was your friend do this said an agent who had worked closely with jackson and who spoke on the condition of anonymity j j was a good agent he made a lot of cases we're all touched by this much of jackson's 15-year career with the dea was spent in dangerous undercover work ferreting out drug dealers he told jurors it was in this role in 1981, that he posed as the nephew of brooklyn n y drug dealer mahlon steward it wasn't long he testified before the two developed a brotherly relationship and began discussing the possibility of putting together their own illicit drug deals steward 60, the government's first witness last week testified how beginning in 1983, he trafficked in heroin and cocaine supplied to him by jackson and garcia jackson described how he and garcia made arrangements to adulterate a pound of seized cocaine and subsequently sold it in one of their early sales he said garcia returned with 21,000 in a paper bag and evenly split the profits among the three agents adulterating narcotics jackson explained meant he would extract a pound of relatively pure cocaine from a kilo 2.2 pounds and replace it with baking soda to cover up the theft he said he performed the procedure at night in the dea's downtown headquarters in another bold theft in july 1984, jackson said he and garcia conspired to steal almost 100,000 in drug proceeds that had been left in a box in the dea cashier's room he said that while garcia distracted a dea agent who was monitoring the room via a television camera he jackson walked into the unlocked room and absconded with the cash similarly jackson said in october 1984, while he distracted a dea guard at the agency's 800-square-foot evidence vault garcia stole one kilo of heroin garcia simply walked down the aisle and removed it jackson said their biggest theft which made the three agents instant millionaires jackson said occurred in november 1985, when they discovered the 180 kilos in pasadena a theft he called the big rip the defense is to cross-examine jackson today
