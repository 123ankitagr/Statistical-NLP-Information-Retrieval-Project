testified that he cut stolen cocaine for illegal street sales at night in the deas offices in the world trade center downtown jackson is a key government witness in the dea corruption trial of former agent darnell garcia 43 of rancho palos verdes who is charged with drug trafficking money laundering and conveying intelligence information to a fugitive drug dealer jackson accused his fellow agent of participating with him in a wide range of crimes between 1983 and 1988 including breaking into a pasadena garage where they ripped off a colombian drug cache of 180 kilos of cocaine worth a potential $ 36 million in street sales orchestrating diversions at dea headquarters to steal drugs from the agencys evidence vault and almost $ 100000 in drug money from a nearby cashiers office instructing jackson and another agent how to hide their drug profits in secret swiss bank accounts and harboring drug fugitives in garcias apartment in bunker hill towers downtown jacksons daylong testimony provided moments of high drama in the second week of a trial growing out of the deas worst corruption scandal under rapidfire questioning from assistant us atty joyce karlan he described a series of drug thefts that quickly made the agents millionaires neither jackson nor garcia showed outward emotion jackson looked at his former colleague only once when us district judge terry j hatter jr asked him to identify the defendant during a recess jackson 41 of claremont shook hands and hugged other dea agents in the court corridor who had come to see him testify responding to reporters questions he suggested that garcias chances of being acquitted were slim he should have gotten off the titanic when it first started going down jackson said referring to the government investigation that resulted in the 1988 indictment of the three agents as evidence mounted against the three jackson and the third agent wayne countryman 47 of walnut pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges last august the two were told by prosecutors they might receive reduced prison sentences jackson 15 years countryman seven years if they cooperated and testified against garcia who has steadfastly maintained his innocence jackson a stocky man known as jj among his associates said he harbored no animosity toward garcia of his stinging testimony jackson told reporters garcia knew that he jackson was doing what he had to do he knows thats the way the cookie crumbles jackson said but if garcia and jackson kept their cool some dea agents in the courtroom audience had difficulty controlling their emotions toward their colleagues predicament it really really hurts to see someone who was your friend do this said an agent who had worked closely with jackson and who spoke on the condition of anonymity jj was a good agent he made a lot of cases were all touched by this much of jacksons 15year career with the dea was spent in dangerous undercover work ferreting out drug dealers he told

garcia conspired to steal almost $ 100000 in drug proceeds that had been left in a box in the dea cashiers room he said that while garcia distracted a dea agent who was monitoring the room via a television camera he jackson walked into the unlocked room and absconded with the cash similarly jackson said in october 1984 while he distracted a dea guard at the agencys 800squarefoot evidence vault garcia stole one kilo of heroin garcia simply walked down the aisle and removed it jackson said their biggest theft which made the three agents instant millionaires jackson said occurred in november 1985 when they discovered the 180 kilos in pasadena a theft he called the big rip the defense is to crossexamine jackson today
