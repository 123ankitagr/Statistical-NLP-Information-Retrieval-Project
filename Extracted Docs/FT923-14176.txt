HARRISON Industries , the supplier of doors , control equipment and castings which was acquired by Antares in a reverse takeover last December , yesterday reported a pre-tax loss of Pounds 908,000 for the 15-month period to end-March 1992 . Mr Kenneth Hodgson , chairman , said a complete review of the group had been undertaken and all previous Antares activities had either been sold or discontinued . The results for the period reflected the completion of the reorganisation , said Mr Hodgson , and represented a marked improvement on the pre-tax loss of Pounds 1.49m for 1990 . Turnover was Pounds 17.7m against Pounds 7.58m for the previous year . There is no final dividend so the total for the 15-month period is 1.25p ( 3.25p ) .
