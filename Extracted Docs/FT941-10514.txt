Sir , Lucy Kellaway regales us ( 'Time to walk and talk ' , February 4 ) with amusing examples of new management jargon , but ignores a reason for it . Linguistics specialists tell us words colour our thinking and so influence our actions . The new jargon does not merely seek to mystify ; it helps shift the agenda . Words such as 'reward ' , rather than 'pay ' , and 'rightsizing ' , rather than 'redundancies ' , bolster managerial authority . We may laugh at jargon but we should know its purpose .
