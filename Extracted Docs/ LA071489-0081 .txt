University of Arizona football player Kevin Singleton has been diagnosed with a form of acute leukemia and began chemotherapy several days ago because his condition was potentially fatal , a cancer specialist said Thursday . Singleton , a 6-foot-2 , 231-pound senior linebacker who was an All-Pacific 10 Conference honorable mention selection last season , was hospitalized last Friday at University Medical Center . Dr. Robert M. Rifkin , associate director of the bone marrow transplant program at the Arizona Cancer Center , said it was important that Singleton 's leukemia was detected `` almost within a week , or less , '' of developing . Rifkin said Singleton is undergoing a three- to four-week therapy that will be followed by another chemotherapy regimen of four to six weeks . `` There is at least an 80 % chance in Kevin 's case of attaining complete remission at the three-week mark , so I think that those are fairly good odds , '' Rifkin said . After the second treatment phase , further chemotherapy could be possible , or doctors could decide to attempt a transplant of bone marrow from his brother Chris , an identical twin , Rifkin said .
