question i want to install residential window film myself to block the sun's heat and stop the fading of my curtains and furniture what type of window film is best so the sun's heat isn't blocked in the winter too answer installing window film yourself is one of the best methods to control the summer sun's heat and glare it lowers your air-conditioning costs and improves your comfort an added benefit is that it blocks nearly all the ultraviolet rays so it protects your curtains and furniture from fading there are many types of window film available and each has its specific sun-control characteristics generally the ones that block the most solar heat in the summer also block it in the winter with proper cleaning window film should last 10 years or more there is a special type of residential insulating window film that uses a low-e low emissivity coating this low-e coating is the same type of coating that is used on the new super-energy-efficient thermal replacement windows it is as effective at blocking the sun's direct heat as ordinary window film and better at blocking reflected heat from patios and walks although insulating film does block some of the sun's heat in the winter it also reduces the heat loss back outdoors overall energy is saved and your heating bills are lower too even if you aren't concerned about stopping the summer sun's heat insulating window film is often a good idea in addition to the winter energy savings and stopping fabric fading it increases the shatter resistance of window glass this is important for children's safety residential insulating window film is available in several degrees of tint after installation you generally won't even notice the lighter-tinted film on your windows there are also more reflective insulating window films available that block even more summer heat it is easy to install insulating window film yourself cut the window film with scissors about 1 inch larger than the window glass area using a spray bottle wet the indoor surface of the window with water peel off the backing wet film's adhesive surface and place it against the glass position the film on the glass and squeegee it to force out the excess water cut the excess film overlap with a razor blade and let it dry you can write to me for utility bills update no 331 for a small sample piece of low-e insulating window film to try on your window heat-blocking and performance specifications addresses of manufacturers and do-it-yourself instructions and diagrams please include 1 and a self-addressed envelope fan no replacement for air conditioner q i was going to install a whole-house fan in our new home along with central air-conditioning will installing a whole-house fan reduce the size of the air conditioner that i need a a whole-house fan which draws fresh air from the windows and exhausts it through the attic by way of an opening in the ceiling can reduce your air-conditioning costs and make you more comfortable but it won't reduce the size of air conditioner you need an air conditioner is sized to meet the cooling needs for the hottest times of the day when you wouldn't be using your whole house fan anyway use the whole-house fan at night and early morning it will keep the house cool well into the late-morning hours however during hot and humid weather you may be better off not alternating the use of a whole-house fan and air conditioner each day too much moisture is absorbed by the house at night and your air conditioner may run longer to remove it the next day letters and questions to dulley a cincinnati-based engineering consultant may be sent to james dulley los angeles times 6906 royalgreen drive cincinnati ohio 45244
