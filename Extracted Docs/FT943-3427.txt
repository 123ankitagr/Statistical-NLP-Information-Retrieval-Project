Forget the high-tech surveillance gadgetry ; clearly , what national leaders need to equip themselves with are solidly-rooted trees . The magnolia that blocked the kamikaze aircraft attack on the White House is not the first example of handy arborial defences . John Major and his cabinet perhaps owe their lives to the cherry-tree that deflected an IRA mortar aimed at 10 Downing Street three years ago . What more proof do we need that George Washington did himself a considerable disservice ?
