A Harbor City teen-ager has been found guilty of murder in the fatal drive-by shooting of a 16-year-old boy who was walking home from church in Wilmington last year . It was Hector Garcia 's third murder conviction in a month . Garcia , who turned 18 in May , will return to Long Beach Superior Court Sept. 1 and could receive 27 years to life in prison for the murder of Rafael Pereda . He was shot to death March 22 , 1988 , moments after he left a youth meeting at Holy Family Catholic Church . Garcia also faces 37 years to life in prison for a double murder in a drive-by shooting in August , 1988 , in Wilmington . `` Hopefully the judge will string the sentences together and he will get at least 64 years to life , '' said Deputy Dist . Atty . Scott Carbaugh as the verdict was read last Friday . Carbaugh said he would have sought the death penalty if Garcia had been an adult when he committed the crimes .
