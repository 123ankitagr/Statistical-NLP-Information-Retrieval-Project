any lingering suspicion that ms janet reno the new attorney general might be a shrinking violet were thoroughly dispelled yesterday morning in her spectacularly pugnacious defence of the government's actions ending the siege of a religious faction's compound in waco last week cabinet members normally approach important congressional hearings with a degree of deference but that element was totally absent in several exchanges between ms reno and members of the house judiciary committee above all with mr john conyers veteran michigan democrat in a typically grandstanding address he said he thought she should have tendered her resignation because of the waco debacle in which over 80 cult members died he was also not satisfied with her explanations of the deaths of the children in the compound this is a profound disgrace to law enforcement in the united states ms reno glared at him from behind her glasses and stuck out her jaw i feel more strongly about it the deaths of the children than you will ever know she spat out with visible anger i will not walk away from a compound where federal agents were killed i will not engage in recriminations i will look to the future mr conyers looked stunned ms reno demanded that he ask more specific questions of her the congressman blustered she offered to come to his office for a private talk a gesture quickly seized on by the committee chairman as a way of dispelling the tension nor in other sharp exchanges did she seek to shift any of the reponsibility for the bloody waco denouement on to president bill clinton the fbi or any one other than david koresh the cult leader who died in the conflagration the decision how to proceed was mine she stated i advised the president of my decision to authorise the use of tear gas and he said he would support my decision there was no realistic expectation the matter would be resolved peacefully if we did nothing
