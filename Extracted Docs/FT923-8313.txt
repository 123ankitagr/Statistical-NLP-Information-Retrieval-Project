THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission , the futures industry regulator , has approved three new contracts that will serve to heighten competition among US futures markets . They include platinum and palladium futures for the New York Commodity Exchange ( Comex ) , although contracts for the two metals already trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange ( Nymex ) . The commission has also approved the application of the Chicago Board of Trade to trade a new international physical commodity index designed with the Commodity Research Bureau . The CBoT 's move to trade a such a contract is aimed at competing with the Goldman Sachs Commodity Index , which started trading last month at the rival Chicago Mercantile Exchange . Comex said that it expected to launch the new platinum and palladium futures as early as next month . Mr Alan Hanson , Comex spokesman , said the exchange was consulting yesterday with the Platinum and Palladium Advisory Group on the exact times for the start of trading .
