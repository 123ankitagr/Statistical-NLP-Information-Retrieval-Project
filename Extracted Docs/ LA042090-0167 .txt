President Frederik W. de Klerk put his job on the line today , telling Parliament that domination of South Africa 's black majority could not end while a white president holds office . `` As long as so much power is concentrated in the hands of one person , if he is white , then no matter what the rest of the system is , there is white domination , '' he said . He told legislators that his job will be up for discussion in proposed negotiations about a new constitution . With the present power of the job , a black presidency would inevitably mean black domination and a Conservative Party presidency would mean conservative white domination , he said . `` Along with constitutional reform , the state president 's post must be fundamentally reformed , '' he said .
