Freshman Olivia Dicamilli scored 24 points and had 23 rebounds Wednesday night , leading the Costa Mesa High School girls ' basketball team to a 56-44 victory over Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and into the Southern Section 3-A semifinals for the first time . Costa Mesa ( 15-11 ) continued its most successful season in the school 's history with Dicamilli dominating play inside and consistently hitting soft jump shots outside . Dicamilli made 12 of 24 shots . Her rebounding total was one short of the 24 she had last Saturday in a 47-45 victory over third-seeded Bellflower . `` We 've been playing really well the last week , '' said Jim Weeks , Costa Mesa 's coach . `` I think we 've peaked at the right time . The players and the student body are really into this . This school had never won a quarterfinal game . '' Notre Dame ( 11-11 ) had problems defending Costa Mesa 's outside shooting as Dicamilli , Rachel Ward and Thuy Nguyen took advantage of a soft zone . Notre Dame made one offensive run , trimming a 34-20 deficit to 38-32 late in the third quarter . But Dicamilli and Nguyen finished the quarter by making jump shots that pushed Costa Mesa ahead , 42-32 , and the Mustangs were never threatened again . `` I do n't think Notre Dame was played against the man pressure that we gave them tonight , '' Weeks said . `` I 've got three girls who shoot really well , so I do n't think a zone is going to stop us . We started slow , but it was just a matter of time before we started hitting . '' Ward , Costa Mesa 's best outside shooter , missed her first six shots and was scoreless in the first quarter . She finished with 12 points . Nguyen made three three-point shots and finished with 15 points . Then , there was the play of Dicamilli . `` She 's a miniature Joni Easterly , '' Weeks said . `` She 's a strong rebounder with great instincts inside . She 's got some future , does n't she ? ''
