a naturally occurring protein that stimulates blood production apparently can help many patients avoid transfusions with donated blood that might be tainted by diseases such as aids a new study found that the protein a hormone known as erythropoietin boosted the amount of blood that surgery patients could store up for their own use researchers reported in the new england journal of medicine the findings indicate that patients who know they are going to need blood during surgery but do not have time to store up enough of their own or are too anemic to do so could be injected with the substance to avoid donated blood researchers said in the new study headed by dr lawrence goodnough an associate professor of medicine at case western reserve university in cleveland researchers asked 47 patients scheduled for surgery at hospitals across the country to store up blood for three weeks half the group was given erythropoietin injections twice weekly the other half received a useless substitute the patients who received erythropoietin produced 54 units of blood compared to only 41 from the other group also blood from those who received the protein contained 41 more oxygencarrying red blood cells the researchers reported
