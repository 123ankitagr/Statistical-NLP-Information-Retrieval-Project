A Taiwanese human rights group and the city of Monterey Park have settled a suit filed after that city 's police prohibited protesters from wearing masks during a May , 1984 , demonstration protesting Taiwanese government policies . The demonstration was staged to show opposition to martial law in Taiwan , which was lifted in 1987 . Protesters wanted to wear masks because they feared that , if identified , their families in Taiwan might suffer . Police told the 50 marchers that their permit would be revoked if they wore masks . In addition , police photographed and videotaped the group . According to the settlement , the city agreed to destroy any evidence , including photographs , gathered during the demonstration . The plaintiffs have been invited to a ceremonial shredding and burning of the evidence Aug. 14 at Monterey Park City Hall . Asst . City Atty . Stephanie Scher said Tuesday that the city agreed not to take pictures of people in masks unless police have specific information that serious criminal activities or violence would be likely to occur during a demonstration . `` I am extremely pleased with the settlement , which affirms the constitutional rights of Taiwanese residents of the U.S. to demonstrate freely , '' said Paul Hoffman , director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California . The ACLU represented the Taiwanese Human Rights and Cultural Assn .
