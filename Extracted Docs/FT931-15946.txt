conventional with-profit endowment pay-outs are made up of the following the sum assured when you start paying premiums a minimum sum is guaranteed to you either when you die these policies started out as life insurance vehicles or when the policy matures this sum will usually be set at a level slightly less than the value of all the premiums paid in by the end of the policy reversionary bonuses these bonuses sometimes called annual bonuses are added to the sum assured each year and once declared cannot be taken away provided the policy continues to maturity such bonuses need to be backed by low-risk fixed-interest investments for the guarantees to be made some offices have multiple reversionary bonus structures with bonuses added on both to the sum assured and to the accrued total of reversionary bonuses terminal bonuses when the policy has matured a terminal bonus may be added this will be a proportion of the accrued reversionary bonuses on the sum assured and allows actuaries to take the latest market conditions into account these bonuses add an element of volatility as they are not guaranteed from one year to the next so they will not as a rule appear on an annual bonus statement unitised with-profits in the past decade insurers have introduced a new form of with-profits contract in which investors buy units with each premium the value of the units increases steadily in line with bonuses announced at the start of the year this avoids the need to make reserves for the entire sum assured from the word go which makes life easier for the office and helps with administration it is much easier to vary premiums under this form of contract surrender values most policyholders do not keep their policy until it matures if so unless they sell it they will receive only a surrender value which is worked out using a different set of calculations from the bonuses which make up the pay-outs on a conventional policy investment returns will have an effect but you will not necessarily receive all the accrued reversionary bonuses if you surrender a policy early
