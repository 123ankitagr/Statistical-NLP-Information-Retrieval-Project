china yesterday launched a blistering attack against the governor of hong kong mr chris patten accusing him of challenging chinese sovereignty and of seeking to perpetuate the division of the chinese people an angry editorial in the communist party newspaper people's daily said mr patten met with a senior official of taiwan's ruling nationalist party mr xu shengfa for a political purpose on november 3 the meeting was held in government house where mr patten openly offered flattery and favours the governor had tried to cover this up by claiming through an aide the meeting was with members of a taiwanese business delegation for commercial reasons only the paper said but on november 9 the manager of china travel service mr li changyi disclosed the governor's guest was a member of the taiwanese nationalist party's central standing committee the editorial said the meeting was greeted by taiwanese newspapers as a break with precedent which opened new top level channels of communication between hong kong and taiwan china regards taiwan as a breakaway province although much of taiwan's enormous trade with the mainland is routed through hong kong because taiwan bans direct trade the colony's leaders have in the past been careful to avoid offending the chinese by officially receiving taiwanese politicians taiwanese officials have often been denied entry to the colony the people's daily editorial said patten's break with precedence is obviously a challenge to chinese sovereignty mr patten wanted to make hong kong an independent or semi-independent or self-governing political entity to continue british colonial rule there was no difference between patten's policies and the aims of some taiwanese who advocated independence for taiwan china kept up the pressure over hong kong yesterday by repeating its refusal to support any attempt by the british authorities to proceed unilaterally with the construction of the multi-billion dollar airport talks in beijing in july failed to reach agreement on financing the new airport the official xinhua news agency reported it quoted an unnamed chinese spokesman for the sino-british joint liaison group who said the british had rejected as too risky a chinese proposal made in july for the urgent work of site reclamation for the airport to proceed pending an agreement on overall financial arrangements the spokesman said the british side was now going back on its words and using the suggestion of the chinese side as an excuse to proceed alone the circumstances were now different the spokesman said and china opposed any decision of the british to go it alone on the airport the escalating row between beijing and the british authorities in hong kong has become dangerously heated since china's angry rejection of mr patten's plan to expand hong kong's 1995 elections saying they violated hong kong's post-1997 constitution each day produces a more furious chinese response on saturday the governor was accused of stepping up the row and told political changes not approved by china would have no future after 1997 the entry of taiwan into the argument adds a further explosive element to an already volatile situation
