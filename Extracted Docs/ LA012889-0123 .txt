An elderly Newport Beach man died Friday in a fire that swept through his home overlooking Lido Marina Village . William Womble , 78 , was killed in the 2:20 a.m. blaze in the 2900 block of Cliff Drive , said Fire Capt . Ray Pendleton . It took firefighters half an hour to control the blaze , which probably was started by a cigarette or cigar , Pendleton said . The fire caused an estimated $ 325,000 damage to the wood frame house and its contents , Pendleton said . It also caused minor damage to a house next door . Neighbors said Womble spent most of his time alone and apparently lived off his investments . `` He was a very sweet man , '' said Corinne Spence , who lived across the street from Womble for 17 years . On Halloween , she said , `` kids loved trick-or-treating there because he always gave big Hershey bars . '' He also allowed neighborhood children to play handball on his garage door , neighbors said . `` He was very kind and gentle , '' said Rich Demmer , 22 , a neighbor who remembers eagerly visiting Womble every Halloween . Spence said Womble 's family built the house before World War II . During the war , she said , the Wombles kept a telescope in the house to watch for enemy submarines . Neighbors also said Womble 's house was cluttered because he collected newspapers , magazines and antiques . `` The whole house was a fire hazard , '' Demmer said . Another neighbor , Betty Glass , 86 , said Womble `` saved everything from 1900 . '' `` I always wanted to go there and look things over because he had a lot of antiques , '' said Glass , whose house suffered minor damage in the fire . On Friday , neighbors began leaving flowers in front of Womble 's home . They plan to hold a memorial service at 3:30 p.m. Sunday at Cliff Drive Park , 2900 Cliff Drive in Newport Heights . The county coroner 's office Friday evening was still looking for Womble 's next of kin .
