germanys money supply growth continued to decelerate in september but not by enough to encourage hopes of further interest rate cuts by the bundesbank over the next few weeks the closely watched m3 monetary indicator rose at an annualised rate of 77 per cent last month some economists had expected it to show a more marked slowdown now that the distortions which caused it to grow more sharply earlier this year have been ironed out the latest m3 figure will reduce market hopes for a further rate cut said mr stephen king economist at james capel in london with relatively high levels of capacity utilisation and strong export and investment growth there is no real case for rates to be reduced again in the current cycle the bundesbank last reduced rates in may by half a percentage point bringing the discount rate down to 45 per cent and the lombard rate to 6 per cent this helped move money out of shortterm deposits included in m3 and into longer term funds recently bundesbank directors have made clear they see no immediate case for further interest rate reductions especially with the strong economic revival mr hans tietmeyer bank president said this week the bank wanted to keep money market rates stable in the face of international volatility the next bundesbank council meeting is on thursday the bank said the introduction of money market funds into germany had had some impact on the slower m3 trend but this should not be exaggerated about dm5bn pounds 2bn flowed into foreignbased money market funds in august and dm3bn in september a further dm12bn went into germanregistered funds not all of this came from assets in the m3 definition however some came from abroad and some was switched from bond holdings by investors nervous about longterm interest rate trends m3 would have grown somewhat more strongly without money market funds but the difference can not be specified from information provided by the bundesbank said mr richard reid an economist with ubs the swiss bank he too thought m3 had not slowed enough to prompt a rate cut at the next two fortnightly council meetings
