Mayor David N. Dinkins promised Monday that his head will not rest at taxpayer expense , whatever the final price tag on a bed that a magazine said is going to cost $ 11,500 . Newsweek noted that the bed 's arrival at the mayor 's official residence coincided with municipal money woes that led Dinkins to freeze hiring , propose new taxes and talk about 15,000 layoffs . If it costs what Newsweek said , that `` will all be covered by private donations from friends of the city , many of whom have contacted me this morning to offer their contributions , '' the mayor said in a statement issued by his press secretary , Albert Scardino .
