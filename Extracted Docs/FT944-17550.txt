one of the biggest railway mergers in us corporate history burlington northern's agreed dollars 2.5 bn takeover of santa fe pacific was yesterday in disarray following the surprise intervention of another big us railway company union pacific with a hostile bid worth dollars 3.2 bn at the end of june burlington northern and santa fe pacific two of the four big railway networks on the western side of the us said they planned to form the biggest railway network in the us through a friendly takeover of santa fe by burlington santa fe's shareholders were due to vote on the all-share offer next month but late on wednesday night union pacific another of the four biggest railway companies west of the mississippi unexpectedly launched a higher all-share offer for santa fe santa fe's board last night rejected union pacific's unsolicited approach while burlington reaffirmed its intention to press ahead with its offer angrily attacking the union pacific bid as anti-competitive our merger with santa fe was a direct response to the dominant position that union pacific has in the west burlington said this is nothing more than an attempt to stifle healthy competition in the western us the immediate question posed by the union pacific bid is whether it is a serious offer or simply a disruptive tactic aimed at scuppering a friendly merger between two of its biggest rivals the price offered by union pacific will tempt santa fe's shareholders but they will have to consider the strong possibility that a merger between union pacific and santa fe would be disallowed on anti-trust grounds a precedent was set 10 years ago when santa fe took over southern pacific the other big railway company west of the mississippi long after the deal had been completed the interstate commerce commission the federal authority that regulates the railway industry ruled that the merger was uncompetitive and ordered it to be unbundled burlington and santa fe have argued with some justification that their merger will not eliminate competition because there are relatively few instances where their routes coincide they describe the deal as an end-to-end merger of two complimentary networks union pacific may find itself on less firm ground because its prime routes are in direct competition with those of santa fe implicitly acknowledging the likely criticisms union pacific said it was ready to guarantee open access on the merged company's tracks to other railway companies the union pacific bid will be highly disruptive to the burlington-santa fe deal at one extreme it could wreck it by causing santa fe's shareholders to demand a higher price for their railway than burlington is prepared to pay at the very least it will complicate the interstate commerce commission's investigation a process that can take up to 30 months union pacific however insisted its offer was serious it said the merger it was proposing would be better for santa fe's shareholders and bring more customer benefits than a merger with burlington whatever the outcome of the bid battle the fact that two railway companies are fighting to acquire a third will emphasise how much the fortunes of the us railway industry have changed in the last few years us freight railways once almost bankrupt are enjoying a surge in profitability because of cost-cutting and increases in productivity following deregulation in 1980 suddenly it seems railways are hot properties again lex page 20
