last week the bund market was dispirited by the bundesbank's decision to leave short-term interest rates unchanged this week it is unlikely to take cheer from two sets of data due in the next few days baden-wurttemberg and north-rhine westphalia two of germany's biggest states are expected to report inflation figures for january today or tomorrow other states report during the week and so it will be possible to get a picture of german inflation for the month as a whole last month pan-german inflation rose at an annual rate of 3.7 per cent predictions for january range from 3.4 to 4 per cent reflecting uncertainty over the impact of higher indirect taxes on petrol a high outcome is likely to reinforce the bundesbank's caution in bringing the lombard and discount rate down from 6.75 and 5.75 per cent respectively where they have been since the end of october the second item of data will be the december growth in m3 broad money supply the bundesbank has warned that the figure will probably be high but confirmation of this will do nothing to cheer investors in the bund market in november m3 grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent well above the upper limit of last year's 4.5 to 6.5 per cent target range
