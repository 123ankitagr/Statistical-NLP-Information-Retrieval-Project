A RISE in commodity prices is likely to be delayed by extension of the world recession into the year to end-June 1993 , according to the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics , Reuters reports from Canberra . 'Abare 's latest estimate is that , as a result of a weaker outlook than previously assumed for the world economy , the current slump will continue into 1992-93 , delaying the anticipated recovery in commodity prices , ' said Mr Brian Fisher , executive director of the bureau . But he told a major commodity conference that Australia 's commodity exports were likely to grow strongly in the medium term , with solid volume growth reinforcing improved prices . Abare expects a 5 per cent drop in Australia's commodity export earnings to ADollars 39.9bn ( USDollars 29.8bn ) in the year to the end of June , the biggest fall in a decade .
