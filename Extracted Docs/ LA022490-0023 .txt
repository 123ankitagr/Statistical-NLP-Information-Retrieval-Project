Everyone knows that because Trevor Wilson can not make two consecutive free throws , he is the UCLA player to foul in the clutch . Given that : 1 ) Why was Wilson in the Stanford game with nine seconds left , and 2 ) even if he was in , why did he get the ball ? Also , after missing the first free throw , why did n't he purposely miss the second ? And , once he made the second , why was n't a Stanford player immediately fouled ? Is n't there one answer , heretofore unmentionable , to the above four questions ? FRANKLIN S. ADLER , Beverly Hills
