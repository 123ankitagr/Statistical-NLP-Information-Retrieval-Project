What price excellence in technology ? The New York Conference Board 's 1992 prize for same , sponsored jointly by the Gartner information- services group , has gone to Donald Fites , the chairman of Caterpillar . He won it , we 're told , for his use of information technology to improve the group 's productivity and links with suppliers , dealers and customers . In the meantime , however , he has led his company not only to a Dollars 404m loss for 1991 , but into a labour dispute threatening to bog down performance this year . Perhaps that 's why he wo n't be collecting the prize in person at the Waldorf-Astoria tonight , sending vice-chairman James Wogsland instead .
