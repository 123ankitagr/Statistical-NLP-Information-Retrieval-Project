PEUGEOT TALBOT , the UK subsidiary of Peugeot , the French car maker , reported an 11 per cent decline in pre-tax profits from a record Pounds 123m to Pounds 109m in 1990 . Mr Geoffrey Whalen , managing director , warned that profits would be 'clearly worse ' this year in the face of the continuing steep recession in the UK new car market . However , last year Peugeot Talbot still achieved its second best financial result since Peugeot took over the chronically loss-making UK operations of Chrysler ( formerly the Rootes group ) in 1978 . Output rose by 8.5 per cent last year to 116,500 vehicles , the highest level achieved by the Ryton plant since 1971 . Production has risen for five years in succession from only 19,977 in 1985 . Mr Whalen said that productivity rose by more than 12 per cent last year , while inventory levels had been reduced to five days supply compared with 15 days two years ago . Turnover rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn . Net profits fell by 29 per cent from Pounds 104m to Pounds 74m , as the company became liable for a full tax charge after exhausting carry-forward losses in 1989 . Importantly the company disclosed yesterday that it would revert to producing two model ranges at the Ryton assembly plant from mid-1992 , when it adds production of a new lower-medium segment car to the existing Peugeot 405 range . The new range will replace the existing Peugeot 309 in the European market next year . The 309 was produced at Ryton from 1986 to 1989 , when production was switched exclusively to the 405 in order to ease capacity constraints at Peugeot 's French assembly plants . Mr Whalen said that work to prepare for the addition of the new range had already begun at Ryton and would involve a modest degree of automation at the currently highly labour intensive plant . The Peugeot group had previously decided against substantial extra investment at Ryton , however , in favour of increasing capacity at its main French plants . Peugeot Talbot said yesterday that car production at Ryton was expected to fall by at least 23 per cent this year to about 90,000 in the face of declining new car demand in both the UK and continental European markets . The company has already cut more than 700 jobs in the last six months reducing its workforce to just over 7,000 . The plant has been working a four-day week for much of this year with 14 production days eliminated in order to reduce output . The rate of production has been cut to 2,100 a week from a peak of 2,650 last year , but Mr Whalen said that five-day working would be resumed in May . Peugeot car sales in the UK last year fell by 11 per cent to 124,000 compared with a fall in the overall UK new car market of 12.7 per cent . As a result the Peugeot marque increased its share of the market modestly to 6.2 per cent from 6 per cent a year earlier . In the first quarter of this year Peugeot further increased its market share to 7 per cent . Sales fell by 8.6 per cent to 31,857 compared with a plunge in the overall market of 21.6 per cent .
