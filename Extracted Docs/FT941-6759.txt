there is a story at once apocryphal and instructive told about jamaican coffee in recent years a neighbouring country never named with which jamaica has agreements for co-operation in agriculture sent a team of agronomists botanists and climatologists to the island's blue mountains to study the region's coffee the group then went home located mountains which appeared similar and at identical altitudes tried to replicate blue mountain coffee to jamaica's relief the experiment failed success would have brought significant gain while the average price obtained for coffee from other important producing nations such as colombia and brazil stands at about dollars 1.00 per pound the jamaican blue mountain coffee fetches prices up to dollars 10.50 per pound says mr john pickersgill general manager of the coffee industry board reflecting the industry's conclusion that coffee produced on 15,000 acres in the blue mountains is the best in the world there is not much of it but the industry believes production can be significantly expanded and these high prices maintained estimated demand for jamaican coffee is four times what the island is producing now the poorer cousins of the premium blue mountain variety are also doing well lowland varieties prime jamaican and high mountain command prices averaging dollars 5 per pound these prices have spawned plans for increased production built on the recovery of the industry after it was devastated by a hurricane which ground its way across the island in 1988 production of 4.5 m pounds last year is expected to reach 11 m pounds by the year 2000, with earnings reaching between dollars 90 m and dollars 100 m the ingredients which make blue mountain coffee are a very rare mixture the first is location in the blue mountain range the trees benefit from a coincidence of elements such as cloud cover rainfall temperature and soil types which all determine the characteristics and flavour of the beans mr pickersgill is forecasting a fall in production for the current crop year which runs from august to july because of changes in the weather production is expected to be about 4 m pounds because unseasonally heavy rains came when the trees were flowering there has been some disquiet in the market because of this but there is no cause for concern especially among the traditional buyers mr pickersgill says the traditional buyers are the japanese who take about 85 per cent of jamaica's coffee in the 1960 s the big market for blue mountain coffee was the uk until the jamaican industry discovered that most was being re-exported to japan and started direct shipments japanese companies have become important investors in jamaica's coffee industry there is also heavy demand mainly for blue mountain coffee in the us which takes about 10 per cent of the product new markets are being encouraged in south east asia and western and central europe the industry has had to struggle with domestic economic developments which have affected all sectors of agriculture farmers seeking loans for expansion of farms and the development of new ones cannot afford current interest rates of more than 60 per cent says mr pickersgill the devaluation of the jamaican currency and high inflation have also made inputs such as weed killers pesticides and fertilisers very expensive for some farmers while transport costs are high and roads are poor another nagging worry is the persistent threat created by the high market value of blue mountain coffee of counterfeiting and misrepresentation of the jamaican product with attempts to pass poorer quality varieties as being genuinely jamaican this could damage the international reputation of the jamaican product and harm the industry mr pickersgill says there have been some attempts at misrepresentation but we have managed to reduce the incidence of this by being very vigilant and sometimes dictatorial
