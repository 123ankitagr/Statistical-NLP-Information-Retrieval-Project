one night of punkrock nostalgia is threatening to splinter tsol just when the bands future as a hardrock contender seems most promising founding bassist mike roche once said that performing on stage with tsol in its tumultuous early days was like standing in the eye of a hurricane now roche is at the center of a storm that is gathering around a dec 29 reunion show at the celebrity theatre in which he and the three other original members of tsol will play together for the first time since 1983 that show has created a crisis between roche and two other current members of tsol who object to the reunion roche 28 is the only link between the punk band that emerged from huntington beach and long beach in the early 80s and the current tsol true sounds of liberty which since 1984 has been honing a brand of hard rock influenced less by punk than by blues and heavy metal for several years roche said in a recent interview he had turned down lucrative offers to reform the original tsol because his focus was strictly on the current band but strife between roche and his current band mates singer joe wood and drummer mitch dean boiled over in a bitter argument that aborted a national tour during midoctober roche said the loss of tour income prompted him to accept a promoters standing offer to reunite the original tsol lineup for one night the other original members are singer jack grisham guitarist ron emory and drummer todd barnes now with wood and dean opposing roches decision to play the reunion the nostalgia show stands as a barrier to reconciliation within the current tsol while this turmoil goes on a strong new tsol album strangelove sits ready for release by enigma records in february the question now is whether the reunion show and the underlying internal problems it has brought to a head will touch off the second major shakeup in tsols 10year history just as the band approaches its best opportunity yet to leap from cult status into the commercial mainstream roche said that money and in part revenge was his first motive for agreeing to reunite with the other original members of tsol he said he was left in a financial lurch when dean and wood after only two shows flew home from a national tour following a vicious argument in berkeley besides counting on the money from touring roche said he had been relying on the crosscountry trip as a way to stay clear of drugs a personal problem that he acknowledges has been a source of tsols internal difficulties that tour was desperately important to me roche said and without it he seized upon a reunion of the original tsol as his quickest way to raise cash since then roche said he has come to believe that playing the reunion actually could be financially harmful to him if it costs him his place in the current tsol theres no way this show is going to earn me near the amount of money i can make in my band the current tsol and there is no way i can get the satisfaction my band gives not to mention the future strangelove is the bomb its got hits on it its the best weve ever done this is the blockbuster for us if theres ever going to be one this is so untimely for me its almost suicide but roche said he will go through with the reunion costly as that could prove to be for his longterm interests for one thing he said the show at decades end will give the original tsol the big sendoff it never had when it broke up acrimoniously in 1983 grisham and barnes left the band then and were replaced by wood and dean roche said there is poetic justice in playing a show at the end of the 80s with the band members who launched tsol as teenaged punk rockers back when the decade began whats more roche said far from doing any harm a onenight reunion can only heighten interest in the current tsol i think im completely in my right to do the show its a matter of principle now is my existence in the new tsol so fleeting and futile that doing or not doing this show can make or break the band if theyre adamant about leaving me out and moving on if thats where our friendship is i dont care to play with them anymore in recent interviews wood and roche both expressed a mixture of anger over the past and hope that they still can find their way to a reconciliation if he does the reunion show it doesnt necessarily mean he wont be in the band wood said i would rather have him with us still wood said roches involvement in the reunion would pose a stumbling block to reconciliation what bothers wood and dean more than the reunion itself wood said is that roche scheduled it without consulting them then decided to go ahead with it despite their objections the reunion issue wood said has become the focus for other underlying strains within tsol with drug abuse the key problem to overcome wood said that he was deeply involved in hard drugs until he quit two years ago every day im a phone call away from going out and screwing up my life he said i cant be around the drugs any more for my own health and my own career roche and dean both said in recent interviews that the collapse of tsols tour in midoctober increased their resolve to overcome substance abuse problems and that they have stayed away from drugs since then ill do anything to make this band work roche said except cancel the original tsols reunion ill be ready to play ready to work and tour and ill be clean if thats not good enough im sorry mike zoto manager of the current tsol said tuesday that he has been staying in phone contact with roche dean and wood in hopes of mending the rift an attempt is being made to draw up a new written partnership agreement that would form the basis for the three members continuing as a band he said i dont know if this reunion show is a nail in the coffin but it doesnt help matters zoto said the show is one of a series of a years worth of stuff that has built up and is boiling over the pot right now not doing the show might put the lid on the pot dean and wood meanwhile were planning to play a tsol show of their own at the green door in montclair on the same night that roche is scheduled to play with the original tsol wood said that an alternate bassist will fill in for roche its a chance to give mike the opportunity to see that the band will play with or without him wood said its not permanent or anything but we will do it however patrick bacich booking agent for the green door said tuesday that he is canceling the clubs tsol show i wasnt aware the other original tsol was playing the same night he said i dont think its practical even current tsol fans would probably go to the other show because its going to be a onceinabluemoon thing i have a feeling this date was booked to spite the original tsol i dont want to be any part of that thats getting into some weird territory turning from tsol infighting to tsol musicmaking a tape of strangelove that roche played during an interview at his long beach apartment backed up the members conviction that it is not only tsols best album but a potential hit the songs are highly melodic and observe contemporary hardrock conventions which bodes well for commercial acceptance but the performances preserve and even intensify the realism and gritty immediacy that has been tsols hallmark guitarist marshall rohners playing is magnificent fiery and free from heavy metals whining squiggly lined guitar cliches wood whose bluesy growl was limited in the past has taken a quantum leap as a vocalist and is now a striking singer who brings a muchexpanded range to bear along with the emotional intensity that he always has possessed if tsols members need any extra incentive to reach their goal of emerging from the bands crisis intact reconciled and drugfree the reason is in their own records grooves
