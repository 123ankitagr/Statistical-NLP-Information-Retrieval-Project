ibm researchers in san jose california have made a highly sensitive sensor for reading computer data on magnetic hard disks they believe it will allow information on disks to be stored nearly 20 times more densely than currently possible by the turn of the century the new sensor called a spinvalve head is five times more sensitive than the diskdrive sensors available now it is the first highdensity recording head designed to take advantage of the giant magnetoresistive gmr effect discovered six years ago until recently all recording heads used electrical induction for reading and writing data on a disk the gmr effect which depends on changes in the electrical resistance of very thin films of a magnetic material in a magnetic field is more sensitive than the induction method for reading data the strength of the signal from the spinvalve allows the diskdrive designers to reduce the width of the magnetic bit track by six times allowing a greater density of data on the bit head ibm said products containing 10bn bits of data per square inch of disk surface will be available by 2000 ibm us 408 927 1283
