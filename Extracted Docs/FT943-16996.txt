IBM researchers in San Jose , California have made a highly sensitive sensor for reading computer data on magnetic hard disks . They believe it will allow information on disks to be stored nearly 20 times more densely than currently possible by the turn of the century . The new sensor , called a 'spin-valve ' head , is five times more sensitive than the disk-drive sensors available now . It is the first high-density recording head designed to take advantage of the giant magneto-resistive ( GMR ) effect , discovered six years ago . Until recently , all recording heads used electrical induction for reading and writing data on a disk . The GMR effect , which depends on changes in the electrical resistance of very thin films of a magnetic material in a magnetic field , is more sensitive than the induction method for reading data . The strength of the signal from the spin-valve allows the disk-drive designers to reduce the width of the magnetic bit track by six times , allowing a greater density of data on the bit head . IBM said products containing 10bn bits of data per square inch of disk surface will be available by 2000 . IBM : US , 408 927 1283
