Dan Sullivan is correct when he states that the Tony Award for best musical used to go to new shows like `` West Side Story '' and the best play award to shows like `` A Streetcar Named Desire '' ( `` The Tonys : An Honor in Decline , '' June 4 ) . Lest anyone get the wrong impression , however , let it be known that `` The Music Man '' beat `` West Side Story '' for best musical in 1958 and `` Mister Roberts '' beat `` Streetcar '' for best play in 1948 .
