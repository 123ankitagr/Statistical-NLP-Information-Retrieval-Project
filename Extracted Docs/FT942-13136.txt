kermits early popularity stemmed from being reasonably standard at a time of great flux and more importantly being free programmers liked the fact that the source code was published which saved the effort of writing their own version kermit may be old but it remains in widespread use it is often the lowest common denominator between two machines that are trying to communicate it has been enhanced to allow connections over the internet as well as dialup connections which were always its forte kermit lacks some of the features such as a graphical interface found in newer software modern programs also manage far more of the lowlevel interaction with the other computer kermit merely acts like a terminal on the remote system and requires the user to know how to log in and access the various services newer software provides a friendly frontend for the user and hides most of the complexities for many people kermit was a doorway into the world of communications allowing them to connect to different systems all over the world this has become much wider and has formalised into the internet and it has become impossible for all but network gurus to navigate their way around as a result there are numerous books on the internet and ways to get around it take the simple problem of trying to find the latest copy of the kermit software there are thousands of computers connected to the internet many of them will have kermit somewhere on them but it would require you to log on to each in turn and then search through all the files looking for it to minimise the pain of searching a database has been developed known as archie that keeps a list of all the programs that other local systems hold using archie you could ask which machines had a copy of kermit and where to look for it there are many systems running archie all around the world to avoid a single system becoming overloaded they regularly exchange information with one another to keep up to date once you have found the location of the software using archie you would then call the system that holds kermit and request it the internet is very open and there are a very large number of systems which allow anyone to log on using a name like anonymous or guest it is a continual surprise to internet newcomers how much software is available for free often it comes with the source code allowing you make changes to it yourself if required archie has limitations it still only keeps an index of the program by name if the kermit software we were looking for were in a file called k290994 then we would not find it most systems use meaningful names but it is not guaranteed the internet is not just one large bulletin board containing programs it also is a repository of vast libraries of information from your desk you can access databases as diverse as the columbia law library the cia factbook and the acoustic guitar digest to make these accessible online the wais program was developed word searches when documents are stored in a wais database it builds an index of every word used in the document to perform a search you simply ask your wais software to find all documents that contain the particular combinations of words you supply to make it manageable you usually specify particular libraries to search a list of libraries is available from a central wais database and the software is supplied with the ability to get this information on startup most wais databases are maintained through volunteer effort and access is free some commercial information providers such as dow jones also maintain wais format databases but naturally enough charge a fee for access to them the newest service on the internet is the world wide web www which provides a hypertext database a hypertext database is one where selected words in the text can be expanded at any time to provide a fuller definition world wide web also allows links between items so that this article about kermit might contain a link to an article about the internet itself if you wanted to know more you would follow that thread while still keeping a bookmark where you were one real advantage of www is that there are versions with a graphical user interface which makes searching much more convenient and intuitive for the nonguru it also provides a far more uniform interface to systems that may be completely different underneath the pool that kermit was spawned in has now become an ocean nonetheless it still forms an important jumpingoff point for new users
