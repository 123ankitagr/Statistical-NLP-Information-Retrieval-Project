ghostbusters ii close encounters of the third kind and tootsie and such popular american tv sitcoms as i dream of jeannie bewitched gidget the monkees and dennis the menace these titles are among the 2,700 feature films and 2,300 episodes of 260 tv series that columbia holds in its library lisbeth barron an entertainment analyst with mckinley allsopp inc in new york estimates that the columbia library alone is worth 1.05 billion and that it generates about 75 million a year in cash flow for the studio in contrast turner's 3,700 title mgm library which he bought three years ago for 1.3 billion generates about 175 million a year sony is anxious to get its hands on these films and tv shows called software in corporate parlance to service the high-tech hardware it manufactures the company already produces laser-disc video players and has a push on to get consumers to buy its 8-millimeter cassette player sony also is developing technology for high-definition tv if they have the library they can force you to buy their kind of hardware explained naofumi okamoto president of a japanese-owned film studio here apricot entertainment sony he said learned a hard lesson six years ago when the company's betamax videocassette technology lost the battle for consumer loyalty to the rival vhs format even though columbia's feature film library is not as highly regarded as some of the others sony will certainly be getting plenty of big-name pictures for its money columbia is tied with united artists for the most best picture winners an even dozen that began with the classic 1934 it happened one night and includes two from the current decade gandhi from 1982 and the last emperor of 1987 for more than two decades during hollywood's golden era from 1932 to 1958, columbia president harry cohn ran his studio on a shoestring the studio was late in introducing color because it was expensive and cohn kept few big stars under contract said jere henshaw who served as casting director for the studio during the late 1950 s columbia was always behind said henshaw now an independent producer at apollo pictures they didn't have much of a library the result is a plethora of b-films from that period titles like snow white meets the three stooges jungle moon men screaming mimi the tingler in which theaters put tinglers in their seats to tickle customers the legend of tom dooley based on the song and have rocket will travel starring the three stooges in outer space but cohn did manage to attract some key film-making talents like directors frank capra robert rossen david lean elia kazan and fred zinnemann capra directed it happened one night as well as the classics mr smith goes to washington and you can't take it with you the 1938 oscar winner under cohn columbia subsequently won best picture oscars for rossen's all the king's men zinnemann's from here to eternity kazan's on the waterfront and lean's the bridge on the river kwai cohn died in 1958, but the studio continued to do well at oscar time winning three academy awards for best picture during the 1960 s for lean's lawrence of arabia zinnemann's a man for all seasons and carol reed's oliver robert benton's kramer vs kramer won the best picture award for the studio in 1979 other popular columbia titles include shampoo the way we were funny girl the last picture show the big chill and tootsie sure columbia has 100, even 200, great titles said henshaw but he added libraries like those at mgm fox and paramount boast many hundreds of films that have proved popular over the years columbia's library has neither the value nor the quality of other studio libraries added a high-ranking executive at another company who is familiar with all the libraries the columbia library said barron is much more extensive on the tv side it's a bit weaker on the feature side among columbia's tv shows are dozens of sitcoms that will generate millions of dollars in the rerun market current hits include who's the boss 227, designing women my two dads and married with children columbia's array of sitcoms will give sony a leg-up over a key competitor mca-universal whose library is dominated by hourlong series although one-hour action adventure shows do much better than sitcoms overseas reruns of sitcoms are most popular here the big money is coming in from half-hour shows said barron columbia also owns the rights to the game shows created by merv griffin wheel of fortune and jeopardy barron believes that sony substantially overpaid for all of columbia pictures operations she values the company at 21.20 a share sony has offered 27 a share
