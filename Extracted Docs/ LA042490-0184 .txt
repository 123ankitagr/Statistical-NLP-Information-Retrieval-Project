Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar lost a bid today to lift an X rating the Motion Picture Assn . of America gave his latest film , `` Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down . '' The MPAA 's appeals board voted 6-6 to sustain the rating despite an impassioned plea by civil rights lawyer William Kunstler . A rating can be overturned only with a two-thirds majority vote . At issue was a sex scene in Almodovar 's film , `` Tie Me Up ! Tie Me Down , '' a black comedy about an escaped mental patient who kidnaps a porn actress and then gets her to fall in love with him by tying her up . The X rating restricts audiences to age 17 and older .
