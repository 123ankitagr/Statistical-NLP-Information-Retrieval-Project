MAY Department Stores , the St Louis-based retailer that includes the Payless shoe store chain , said yesterday that it had asked the board of Morse Shoe to provide information on a proposed merger with J. Baker , the footwear group , and that May might be willing to make a rival offer of Dollars 55m for Morse Shoe . The company said that the purpose of acquiring Morse would be to step up its presence in the north-eastern US generally and in the New York area in particular . May said that , if the bid went ahead , it would be an all-cash offer . This is in contrast to the J. Baker proposal , and would not be contingent on financing arrangements , due diligence requirements , or any other major conditions . May already operates around 3,500 shoe stores through he Payless chain , in addition to some 320 department stores .
