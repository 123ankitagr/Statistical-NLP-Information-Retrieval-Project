its like an individual retirement account but in some ways better its one of the few legitimate tax shelters left that you can still pursue this late in the year and many people who are eligible to have one dont its a keogh plan and if you have selfemployment income you should consider opening one this week if you dont have one basically anybody who has selfemployment income should be looking at setting up a keogh says edward rosenson a tax partner in charge of personal financial planning in the los angeles office of the accounting firm ernst young but many people dont know about keoghs because the publicity by far is in favor of iras sometimes called super iras keoghs are taxdeferred retirement accounts that you can set up if you earn selfemployment income such as from your own business professional practice or from a small sideline activity or hobby if you work for a big corporation by day but moonlight as a screenwriter painter carpenter or other selfemployed worker you can put the income from that selfemployment into a keogh keoghs have many of the advantages of iras contributions are taxdeductible earnings accumulate tax deferred until withdrawn presumably when you retire assets can be invested in many of the same instruments allowed in iras such as certificates of deposit stocks bonds and mutual funds like an ira you can set up a keogh at a bank brokerage house or mutual fund you also can roll over lumpsum distributions from your pension plan 401k company savings plan or other qualified retirement plan into your keogh but keoghs have some advantages over iras among them you can put more money into them in fact the limits for annual contributions are far higher than the $ 2000 annual limit on ira contributions the exact amount depends on which type of keogh you choose in a profit sharing keogh the most flexible type you can decide each year whether to contribute and how much up to 15 of your net profit from your selfemployment activity to a maximum of $ 30000 in a money purchase keogh you can contribute a fixed percentage of selfemployment earnings each year up to a maximum of 25 or $ 30000 but you must contribute this same amount every year unless your business shows a loss you can also choose a paired plan that has features of both profit sharing and money purchase plans you choose the percentage that you contribute annually to the money purchase portion and then you can contribute to the profit sharing portion the total can go up to 25 there also are defined benefit keoghs in which you can contribute even more youll need a professional such as an actuary or accountant to tell you how much according to michael shuler a public affairs specialist with the internal revenue service in los angeles you have more flexibility on when to contribute like an ira you must set up your keogh by dec 31 of the year you will claim deductions for your contribution but you can wait until you file april 15 or even later if you get an extension before actually making the contribution deductible for the previous tax year with an ira your deadline is april 15 regardless of whether you file for an extension you can save taxes upon withdrawal money you withdraw from an ira after age 59 12 is generally taxed at your regular rate but if you have contributed for at least five years to a keogh were at least 50 years old in 1986 and take your money out of your keogh in a lump sum after age 59 12 you may be able to use a special fiveyear averaging procedure in effect this allows you to treat the account as if you withdrew the money in equal smaller amounts stretched over five years thats going to lower your tax because of these advantages if you are leaving a company consider rolling over your company pension or 401k money into a keogh instead of an ira another advantage to keoghs you can have one and still keep your ira and even if you are not eligible for a deductible ira contribution because you already have a pension plan through your employer and exceed certain income limits you can still make deductible contributions into a keogh also although you must start withdrawing from your keogh at age 70 12 just like with an ira you still can keep contributing after that age as long as you continue to earn selfemployment income ira contributions are no longer allowed after that point of course not all is a picnic with keoghs there are some drawbacks to set up a keogh youll need some advice from an accountant attorney or other expert the process is much more complicated than with an ira a lot more paper work is involved and there are a lot more rules governing how often and how much you must contribute also if you have employees who work for you in your selfemployment business you must include them in your keogh which in effect becomes your businesss pension plan the keogh is subject to various rules including provisions preventing you as owner from benefiting disproportionately compared to your employees
