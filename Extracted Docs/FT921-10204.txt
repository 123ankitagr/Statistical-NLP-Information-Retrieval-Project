to calm anxious grain traders the chicago board of trade will offer a seminar later this month on el nino the weather phenomenon that develops in the equatorial pacific every three to five years and can cause global climate upsets grain traders are keen to know if they can expect this year's el nino to disturb the us weather pattern sufficiently to make a dent in crop output although signs of el nino had been accumulating during 1991, only last month did the the us national weather service finally conclude publicly that the phenomenon was a fact the symptoms had been showing themselves overseas since last spring rising surface temperatures in the eastern and central pacific drought in the western pacific rim from australia through indonesia a weaker indian monsoon dryness in north-eastern brazil drought in south africa and wetness last summer in the great basin of the us which runs from arizona north to idaho while many of these conditions indicate that el nino is occurring they do not reveal its severity the phenomenon generally peaks in the northern hemisphere's winter this helps explain why peruvian fishermen dubbed the phenomenon el nino which means christ child in spanish it arrived about christmas time mr vernon kousky a research meteorologist with the us weather service now assesses the current el nino as moderate to strong while individual weather events cannot always be directly attributed to el nino some signals are indicative of its strength warm water in the pacific is pushing moisture into the south-western us causing for example this winter's floods in texas according to mr art douglas chairman of the creighton university's atmospheric sciences department along the gulf of mexico from texas to florida some areas have already had 200 per cent to 1,000 per cent of their normal rainfall temperatures in that region are also beginning to dip below normal at the same time the phenomenon is upsetting the jet stream keeping extremely cold air far to the north and moderating temperatures in the midwest the midwest america's most important grain area is seeing temperatures four or five degrees fahrenheit above normal said mr jon davis the in-house meteorologist for shearson lehman's commodities trading arm the weather service predicts that more of the same will occur in those regions until spring and that the usually wet north-west is likely to be dryer as is the ohio valley but what concerns the grain trade more is what if anything will happen during the critical planting and growing season for american crops from june to august unfortunately weather forecasting is not a precise science mr kousky says that el nino usually a 12 to 18 month event has another six to 12 months to run but he points out that there is no consistent relationship between el nino and the weather pattern beyond the winter-to-spring months anything can happen he admits crop cast a maryland-based weather forecasting service that is used by many us commodity trading houses says that while el nino has already affected south american soyabeans south african maize and australian wheat it is hoping to be able to predict potentially damaging crop effects in the us by looking at the coincidence of the el nino with two other climatological events last year's eruption of mount pinatubo in the phillippines and the combination of lunar and solar cycles these additional factors along with el nino probably mean that a more extreme weather pattern bleeds over into summer according to mr kevin marcus director of crop cast services he says the likelihood of extreme hot and dry weather is 100 per cent but gives only a one in three chance that this will have a significant impact on crops the hot dry weather would have to occur in july or early august to reduce the maize and soyabean crops significantly that is by more than 10 per cent but mr marcus is uncertain about how the three phenomena will interact since there no established pattern he is still waiting for more data on the severity of this year's el nino the phenomenon has prompted commodities markets to gyrate in the past in 1972-73 the el nino destroyed the peruvian fishmeal catch which then accounted for some 45 per cent of the world trade in protein feed in 1982-83 it caused a drought in africa which helped to send cocoa prices up by nearly 70 per cent over a period of about a year
