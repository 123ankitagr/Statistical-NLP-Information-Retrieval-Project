A powerful typhoon combined with the summer holiday rush to create the longest traffic jam in Japan 's history -- an 84-mile-long highway mess , the Japan Highway Corp. said today . `` It is the longest traffic jam on record , and it was basically caused by bad luck , '' corporation spokesman Katsutoshi Furuya said . `` Many drivers were on the road that day because the typhoon had kept them off it the day before , '' he said . `` Everything just seems to have come together in the worst way . '' The record-setting traffic snarl occurred on a highway between Hyogo and Shiga prefectures in western Japan . About 15,000 vehicles were involved in the traffic jam , which occurred Aug. 12 , he said . Japanese generally take holidays in the Aug. 10-19 period to mark `` O-bon , '' or the Festival of the Dead . It is a time when families gather to pay respects to their ancestors .
