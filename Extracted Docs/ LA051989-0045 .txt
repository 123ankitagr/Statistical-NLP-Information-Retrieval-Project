in response to only in l a the mayor is on the firing line but draws little flak by john allswang op-ed page may 11 don't you ever believe the public is not very concerned about bradley's activities the flak comes from the silent majority of citizens who could never be heard through a newspaper which has supported the mayor all these years bradley has been on the fence for so long never taking a stance on any controversial issue he should have many pickets but alas grinning tom is finally having to say something about something why shouldn't his relationship with the business community and power structure be excellent he is their man and similar to the old mayor richard daley regime in chicago everything slips quietly into operation before the public is aware low key of course a sure way of not broadcasting your errors in judgment or the fact that the mayor has taken outside employment give us a break tom democrat and republican politicians alike have a hands-off policy not unlike house speaker jim wright's dilemma because of the glass houses and stones theory i am one of the former locals who say get him tom bradley for starters then get all of them vote out all incumbents who have even a faint smell of corruption kathryn johnson torrance
