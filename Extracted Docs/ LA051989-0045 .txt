In response to `` Only in L.A. -- The Mayor Is on the Firing Line but Draws Little Flak , '' by John Allswang , Op-Ed Page , May 11 : Do n't you ever believe the public is not very concerned about Bradley 's activities . The flak comes from the silent majority of citizens who could never be heard through a newspaper which has supported the mayor all these years . Bradley has been on the fence for so long , never taking a stance on any controversial issue , he should have many pickets . But alas , grinning Tom is finally having to say something about something . Why should n't his relationship with the business community and power structure be excellent , he is their man . And similar to the old Mayor Richard Daley regime in Chicago , everything slips quietly into operation before the public is aware . Low key , of course . A sure way of not broadcasting your `` errors in judgment , '' or the fact that the mayor has taken `` outside employment . '' Give us a break , Tom . Democrat and Republican politicians alike have a hands-off policy , not unlike House Speaker Jim Wright 's dilemma , because of the `` glass houses and stones '' theory . I am one of the former locals who say `` get him , '' Tom Bradley for starters , then get all of them . Vote out all incumbents who have even a faint smell of corruption . KATHRYN JOHNSON Torrance
