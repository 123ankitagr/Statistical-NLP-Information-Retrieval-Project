sir to add a twist to recent correspondence on gps working hours letters february 56 l would like to suggest an improvement to benefit both doctors and patients why not introduce a noclaims bonus system by which patients who have made fewest calls on the doctor in the previous year are given a priority on choice of appointment times perhaps for busy people a special early morning reserved slot could be introduced naturally nighttime calls would lead to rapid loss of bonus points genuine emergencies would be unaffected provided the doctor agreed with the need for an emergency call after attending the patient now that most practices are computerised this system should be relatively easy to run with perhaps three priority categories for patients peter vos 17 vicarage lane east preston littlehampton west sussex bn16 2sp
