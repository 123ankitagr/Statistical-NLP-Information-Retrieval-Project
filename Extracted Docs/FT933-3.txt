the taj mahal is in the final stages of a cleanup when workmen have finished scrubbing its marble dome early next month visitors will see a shining new face of the taj says mr ghulam nabi azad the minister for tourism and civil aviation the ministry is so convinced that the taj will look even more special than before that it is raising the entry fee from rs2 to rs10 also for the first time in many years officials will open the monument in the evenings so that visitors can once again see the sight which sent mughal poets into raptures the white dome of the taj bathed in moonlight unfortunately it will take a lot more than renovating the taj to improve the image of indian tourism even though the country has enough attractions to fill a continent it is finding it difficult to lure visitors to india tour operators are reeling from the combined impact of last years interreligious riots bomb blasts and air crashes as well as the persistent bad effects of repeated airline strikes bureaucratic delays and poor service nonresident indians are still coming to india and so are backpackers but the bigspending western travellers are not coming in the numbers that india had hoped last winters unrest came too late for many visitors to cancel their travel plans and the number of tourists rose by a hefty 28 per cent to 187m but this years figure may show no increase at all because wouldbe visitors have time to seek alternative destinations mr op ahuja an executive committee member of the indian association of tour operators says that about 10 of the 14 us tour operators active in india have this year cancelled programmes thomson the uks largest travel company and nippon travel bureau the biggest operator in japan have both cut back i am not very optimistic about this year says mr ahuja there is little the indian tourism industry can do about riots and bomb blasts except wait for potential travellers to forget about them however much of the malaise in indian tourism such as the persistent airline strikes is of the industrys own making if the sights of india are unforgettable so sometimes are the frustrations involved in trying to see them india is a developing country with many needs more pressing than keeping tourists happy western tourists coming to india can not expect the same levels of comfort and efficiency as in their developed states also much of indias great charm lies in its otherworldly atmosphere its villages and temples are often suffused with a gentleness quite remote from modern life even its cities hide corners of tranquillity such as the tombs of the lodi kings in lodi gardens in delhi however other developing countries notably egypt have managed to promote tourism despite their political and economic difficulties indias most serious problem is domestic transport indian airlines the main stateowned domestic carrier has a poor reputation for service in the last two winters it has also been hit by long pilots strikes which spoiled many a holidaymakers visit an elderly german woman travelling through bombay last year was almost in tears after spending 40 hours on trains covering the ground she had expected to cover by air the other 19 people in my group cancelled when they heard about the strikes i should have cancelled too she said service on indian airlines is improving rapidly in response to competition from newlylaunched private airlines which have captured about 20 per cent of the market but labour relations remain tense not least because indian airlines pilots are demanding that their pay and conditions stay on a par with the private companies pilots it would be rash to bet on a strikefree 199394 as far as hotels are concerned indias luxury chains including the taj oberoi and itc groups are generally on a par with their counterparts elsewhere in asia however except in goa a longestablished tourist centre india lacks reliable networks of touristclass hotels too often the foreign visitor is faced with a choice of paying over dollars 100 a night or less than dollars 10 with nothing in between even the luxury chains have little control over the management of tourist sites museums and wildlife parks etc which is mostly in the hands of the central and state governments at their best these can be effective such as the organisation of a son et lumiere show at delhis red fort home of the last mughal emperors but too often there are monumental difficulties even in making bookings take for example corbett park a wildlife sanctuary in the foothills of the himalayas in the state of uttar pradesh which is run by the state government it is possible to stay in the middle of the park in a simple tourist centre which stands on the edge of a wild and beautiful lake but control over the rooms in the centre is split between three offices in delhi lucknow and the town of ramnagar which is more than an hours drive from the park trying to make a reservation can involve ringing all three to ensure that a room booked in one office is confirmed by the others by the time the visitor reaches the sanctuary itself it is too late even if there are empty unreserved rooms the staff are not allowed to let them mr ahuja says the underlying problem is that even though some state governments such as rajasthan promote tourism most care too little they cant see that they would benefit from the revenues and the jobs it will bring the central government tries to promote change with publicity campaigns but it is hampered by the constitutional division of power which gives the states the prime role in controlling tourism india hopes to attract 5m visitors annually by the year 2000 it is hard to see how it will do this u n l e s s it learns to look more carefully after those it already draws
