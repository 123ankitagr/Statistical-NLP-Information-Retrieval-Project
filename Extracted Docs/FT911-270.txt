THE government yesterday confirmed its plan for a National Film Commission to attract foreign investment in the film industry . The plan , first mooted last June by Mrs Margaret Thatcher , then prime minister , was outlined by Lord Hesketh , minister responsible for the film industry , at the 44th international film festival in Cannes . It follows the announcement of a Pounds 5m package to help UK film makers set up co-production with their more subsidised continental counterparts . The commission will be funded by the Department of Trade and Industry with a budget of Pounds 3.5m spread over four years . Mr Sydney Samuelson , the chairman of Samuelsons , international film production company , has been appointed the first national film commissioner . The role of the commission will include giving advice on taxation schemes , work permits and location schedules . The measures have been criticised by some film makers and the Labour party as insufficient because they do not include special tax incentives . The ailing UK film industry has been pressing for quicker write-offs , reduction of the withholding tax on foreign actors and changes to make the Business Expansion Scheme more suitable to finance feature films .
