scientists studying long-term survivors of hiv the virus that causes aids have discovered a type of immune cell which enables people to remain healthy for more than 10 years after infection dr jay levy of the university of california san francisco described the discovery to the world aids conference in amsterdam yesterday he predicted that it would soon lead to new ways of treating hiv the vital finding is that a white blood cell called cd8 seems to determine how long people with hiv stay healthy its role is to attack other infected cells and either kill them or suppress the virus in most people with hiv the cd8 cells lose their activity after a while then the cd4 cells the immune cells whose loss is normally used to define the progress of the disease disappear and the patients start to suffer aids symptoms dr levy's researchers are purifying a protein known as a cytokine which cd8 cells secrete to stop hiv replicating in other immune cells they expect to have isolated and identified it within six months new aids drug trials page 22
