A former Hawthorne police sergeant who drew nationwide attention with a televised `` sting '' operation conducted to expose alleged police racism was found unconscious in a car that former football star Jim Brown had reported stolen , Los Angeles police said Tuesday . Don Jackson was discovered late Monday in a 1985 Pontiac Fiero parked next to a Los Angeles International Airport terminal , said Police Cmdr . William Booth . Jackson was not arrested , but police were trying to determine whether a crime had been committed . Booth said the stolen-car report `` appears to be the fruits of a family dispute . '' Jackson said he had `` nothing to do '' with the car being stolen . Jackson said that on Tuesday he went to the airport to pick up Brown 's daughter , Brandy Love , whom he said was a friend . `` I became extremely ill and nauseated and passed out as I got out of the car , '' Jackson said . He was treated at Daniel Freeman Marina Mercy Hospital for an inflammation of the stomach and released , a hospital spokesman said . Brown could not be reached for comment . Jackson gained national attention last January when an NBC television news crew surreptitiously photographed a white Long Beach policeman as he appeared to slam Jackson 's head through a shop window .
