don mclean first came into prominence for his songwriting critics hailed his 1972 megahit american pie as the musical epitaph for an era its lyrics were analyzed and reanalyzed by life time and newsweek nearly two decades later mclean now 44 has come out with a double album consisting entirely of interpretations of old pop songs for the memories volumes 1 and 2 is a collection of 20 classics from the 1930s through the early 60s including hoagie carmichaels stardust irving berlins change partners marty robbins a white sport coat and sam cookes what a wonderful world im not just a songwriter and ive always felt there were certain songs i could sing as a singer but never write said mclean who will perform saturday night at the bacchanal in kearny mesa they were songs ive always loved and i felt i could do them in a different way in my way and interpret them as a pop singer would interpret popular songs its just something i felt like doing and i did it very quickly i just went into the studio and sang and sang and sang and it took about two days to record and mix the whole thing mcleans attempts to focus attention on his pipes rather than his pen date back to 1981 when he scored a big hit with a remake of roy orbisons crying since then hes made a point of mixing covers with originals both in concert and on his albums to further defy the topicalsongwriter categorization thats haunted him since american pie mclean has never felt comfortable with that label and with good reason variety has always been the essence of his career one of the first songs he ever wrote and i love you so was a huge easylistening hit for veteran pop crooner perry como less than two years after american pie mclean recorded an album of songs in traditional folk and bluegrass styles on subsequent recordings hes been backed by everything from rock bands to symphony orchestras and in 1987 he cut a straightahead country album love tracks im a lot of different don mcleans he said i want to do something different with every record i do so that when im dead and buried you can go back and listen to all my records and not find any songs that sound alike i want to use my career and my chance to record to express a wide variety of my talents and this has always been my plan my hope its not a great idea if you want to be super commercial but from the first album i ever made 1970s tapestry i decided this is what i want to do if you go back to tapestry theres stuff with a quartet stuff with strings and stuff with just me and my guitar and at the time nobody else was doing that the record companies would say pick a sound and stick with it for 10 sides but i could never do that and i never did mclean was born in new rochelle n y and grew up listening to such disparate artists as frank sinatra the weavers and buddy holly my father died when i was 15 and i was left with a widowed mother who i had to support mclean recalled but i was also free to pursue my dream which was to play my guitar and sing and thats what i did when i was 17 i went on the road and began performing in coffeehouses all over the country but at the same time i was going to school my father had always wanted me to go to college and i did studying economics at iona college in new rochelle i was on the road and i usually had a school book with me after graduating in 1968 with a bachelors degree in economics mclean struck up a friendship with folk singer pete seeger the two sang together at a benefit concert for the hudson river sloop restoration and later that year mclean was named hudson river troubadour by the new york state council on the arts for six weeks he traveled the length of the river playing three concerts a day five days a week in various towns along the hudson in 1969 mclean landed a recording contract with mediarts records which was promptly absorbed by the nationally distributed united artists label tapestry came out a year later followed by american pie the title track an 8 12minute saga inspired by the death of buddy holly went on to become one of the biggestselling singles of 1972 i had always been a great lover of buddy hollys music and i felt his death personally mclean said i kept that with me and one day it just came out i fused my feelings about his death with a whole bag of other things in my heart about this sense of loss this sense that we were somehow losing america and it just turned into that song the overwhelming critical and commercial success of american pie which ultimately spent four weeks at no 1 on the national top 40 charts made mclean an instant superstar but he soon discovered that fame is fleeting after scoring three followup hits with vincent a tribute to artist vincent van gogh castles in the air and dreidel and being immortalized by songwriters charles gimble and norman fox in killing me softly with his song roberta flacks grammy awardwinning single of 1973 mclean pretty much faded from view although he continued to record and tour i really wasnt in a great mental state during those years he said the stresses and the strains of many things developed into a situation that wasnt happy the relationship between the people representing me and my label soured and coupled with the fact that i had a lot of personal problems i wasnt altogether thrilled with the way things turned out in 1976 mclean left united artists and signed with arista records his arista debut 1977s prime time was a commercial dud four years later he resurfaced on the millennium label with chain lightning which yielded the top 40 hit crying since then mclean has jumped ship two more times first to capitol records after a protracted legal battle with his former manager then to the gold castle label but he has yet to find his way back to the pop charts he says that doesnt bother him i have a full concert schedule every year and ive made enough money to keep me set for life mclean said besides if your whole life is centered around image and show business youre bound to be a tortured individual once youve been no 1 once youve won your grammys and your gold records theres only one place to go and thats down so you really have to have another life which is why i have so many other things im interested in aside from concentrating on being don mclean on recapturing my past success mclean is putting together a musical don mcleans america scheduled to open in june at the chichester festival theater in england
