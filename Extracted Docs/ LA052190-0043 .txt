the idea animals sixth sense navigate long regarded folk notion akin crystal balls hard science but current research indicates range organisms bacteria large mammals may use internal compasses get around organisms diverse bacteria butterflies salamanders whales humans contain magnetically aligned material known magnetite iron oxide the function magnetite may vary greatly among species interesting speculation centers magnetoreception theory organisms use biological bar magnets enhance sense direction in many creatures chains magnetite crystals form compasses aid migration long

dolphins sometimes beach certain points and preliminary work humans suggests scientists man might biological compasses well idea met others skepticism the field considered romping ground charlatans according caltech geophysicist joseph kirschvink but skepticism surrounding magnetoreception subsided 1975 thengraduate student richard blakemore discovered bacteria containing chains magnetite crystals encapsulated organic membranes each crystals magnet unto many respects similar much smaller bar magnets used schoolchildren a bacteriums membrane keeps individual crystals literally line preventing lumping together held together membrane individual magnets work team form single magnet called magnetosome bacteria contain magnetosomes great advantage while latter move random fashion frequently traveling circles former able swim straight lines allows cover new territory search food the 20 magnetite crystals make magnetosome measure 400 1000 angstroms an angstrom equivalent
