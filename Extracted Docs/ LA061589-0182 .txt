A campground in the Angeles National Forest has been closed to allow health officials to control an outbreak of an animal disease that shows up as bubonic plague in humans , authorities said Wednesday . A ground squirrel found in the Table Mountain Campground about four miles west of Wrightwood has tested positive for sylvatic , or animal , plague , Los Angeles County health officials said . The disease is a bacterial infection affecting wild animals -- especially ground squirrels -- and can be transmitted to humans by means of a flea bite . In humans , plague symptoms include enlargement of lymph glands near the bite , followed by fever and chills . It can be fatal if left untreated .
