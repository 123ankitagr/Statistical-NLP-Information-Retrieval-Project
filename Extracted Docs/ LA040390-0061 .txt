columbia savings loan rendered insolvent by huge losses has little chance of surviving as an independent institution but a government takeover is not imminent thrift industry sources said monday industry officials said it is unlikely that columbia will be seized by the federal government until after regulators decide what to do with the firm's huge portfolio of junk bonds which are risky high-yield corporate debt securities that process could take several weeks or even months an effort to sell the bonds possibly to a single buyer is being spearheaded by first boston corp the new york investment banking firm and thomas spiegel who resigned as columbia's chief executive earlier this year a number of investors are believed to be interested in the bond portfolio including well-known private investors as well as publicly held financial institutions neither first boston nor thomas spiegel would comment on their plans in any event columbia's shareholders probably will lose their entire investment the stock closed monday at about 40 cents a share down 72 cents in new york stock exchange trading most of columbia's stock is owned by the spiegel family led by abraham spiegel 83, the company's current chairman and father of thomas 43 the elder spiegel could not be reached for comment columbia is the latest major casualty of the recent collapse in the junk bond market thathas also hit such other financial firms as drexel burnham lambert and san diego-based imperial corp of america columbia became at one point the nation's most profitable thrift largely through profits on the high-yield securities bought through drexel andjunk bond king michael milken who had close ties to the spiegels columbia based in beverly hills announced sunday that its capital had been wiped out by about 575 million in losses in the fourth quarter of last year and first two months of this year the red ink resulted primarily from government-mandated writeoffs and serious credit problems in its junk bond portfolio officially columbia says it has enough viable assets that given time could lead the firm back to financial health notwithstanding our current financial condition we believe columbia has the resources to reach full compliance with capital standards mandated by congress before the dec 31, 1994, deadline columbia chief executive edward g harshfield said in a statement sunday but harshfield was not available for comment monday and very few seemed to take his statement at face value harshfield is a former banker from citicorp who took over as ceo last month a more realistic hope one industry official said is that columbia savings will make enough through the sale of its junk bonds that the american taxpayer at least will be spared the expense of bailing out columbia's losses the thrift's liabilities currently exceed its assets by 121 million columbia's dilemma seems certain to accelerate a heated if arcane debate over the methods of accounting that have caused columbia savings huge paper losses in recent months and led to the evaporation of its capital last year's legislation to bail out the s l industry contained a provision that forced all thrifts to sell their junk bond investments within five years that in turn forced the thrifts to immediately recognize unrealized market losses on the bonds because they could no longer count on holding them until maturity even the regulatory establishment is known to be sympathetic to columbia's plight but regulators say they are merely following the will of congress i think this is terribly unfair and i say that out of no great love for the spiegels one former high-level washington regulator said the spiegels dilemma does not generate much sympathy with industry traditionalists who never liked columbia's controversial but once legal practice of investing depositors money in high-yield bonds s ls have traditionally invested in real estate loans but that was only a small part of columbia's investment portfolio though not the only thrift in the nation to invest in junk bonds columbia savings had the largest holdings its high-yield bond portfolio is valued at more 3 billion other thrifts that put money in junk bonds included imperial savings in san diego and centrust savings in miami which together owned about 1.7 billion in junk bonds at the end of 1989 both financial institutions have been seized by regulators and are presently being operated as wards of the government any sale of columbia's junk bonds must receive the approval of several regulatory bureaucracies and it is believed that well-known buyers with blue-chip reputations have the best chance of getting their purchases approved columbia's junk bond portfolio cost market value corporation thousands thousands rjr
