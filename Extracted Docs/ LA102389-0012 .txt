A 31-year-old transient was shot to death early Sunday morning at a Van Nuys house that neighbors say is often used for prostitution and selling narcotics , police said . Van Nuys police , who had been alerted by a witness , arrived about 4:45 a.m. and found the victim 's body in the living room of a house in the 15800 block of Marlin Place , said homicide Detective Jim Vojtecky . The victim 's name was withheld pending notification of his family . Vojtecky said he was killed by one shotgun blast to his upper body . William Scott Carter , 27 , an acquaintance of the victim who lives at the house , was arrested several hours later on suspicion of murder . He was being held without bail at the Van Nuys jail . Witnesses told police that 15 people were at the house smoking rock cocaine when an argument , either about drugs or a woman , broke out between Carter and the victim . The victim armed himself with a knife and Carter pulled out a shotgun , firing one round , Vojtecky said . Although Carter fled , an anonymous caller tipped police to his whereabouts and he was arrested at another house in Van Nuys a short time later , police said .
