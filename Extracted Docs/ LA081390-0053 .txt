A new treatment for sickle-cell anemia -- a drug that reduces the anemia and helps prevent the painful `` crises '' that mark the disease -- has shown promise in a small , preliminary study of three patients with the disease . In people with sickle-cell anemia , red blood cells contain an abnormal form of hemoglobin , the oxygen-carrying protein , that can distort cells from their normal bagel shape into a crescent or sickle shape , making them unusually fragile and often leading to painful blockages of blood vessels . A report in last week 's issue of the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the drug , hydroxyurea , can improve the survival of red blood cells and reduce pain in people with the disease . About 50,000 Americans have sickle-cell anemia . The drug works by increasing the body 's production of another form of hemoglobin that is normally produced during fetal life . Hydroxyurea has been used for about 15 years to treat chronic leukemia and other blood disorders sometimes seen in elderly people . The report 's authors said they were excited by the findings , but cautioned that before hydroxyurea becomes widely used for sickle-cell anemia , their results should be confirmed in a much larger , multihospital study that would compare the drug with a placebo . The study was conducted by researchers at Harvard and Johns Hopkins medical schools .
