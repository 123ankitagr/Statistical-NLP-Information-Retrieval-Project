I have always voted Democratic . . . sometimes with enthusiasm and sometimes not . Had I known that Vice President George Bush would choose his team on the strength of their tennis prowess ( `` Tennis , Everyone ? '' by Paul Dean , Dec. 19 ) , I might have made an exception in this last election . Who can fault men who like a game that is played on a court where service is a vital part of the game ? The only problem is , it is also a game where love means nothing . Maybe I voted the right way after all ! Time will tell . MARJORIE L. SCHWARTZ Los Angeles
