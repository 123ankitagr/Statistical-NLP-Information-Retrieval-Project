How ironic that on the same day Mahony writes to criticize your editorial supporting abortion there is an article on the Op-Ed Page entitled `` Infant Mortality : A National Disgrace . '' The column , by Sen. Bill Bradley , states , `` More than 40,000 American babies die every year , most of them needlessly . . . ( due to ) poverty , ignorance and neglect . '' Where is Archbishop Mahony ? Where is the Catholic Church ? Where are the anti-abortion `` pro-life '' marchers who want to see Roe vs. Wade overturned ? Where is their conscience when it comes to protecting those who have been born and either die within the first few months due to `` poverty , ignorance and neglect , '' or go on to become abused or discarded as a result of `` poverty , ignorance and neglect ? '' I 'd like to see them put an end to the needless slaughter ( physically and mentally ) of the born . And while they 're at it , why do n't they adopt a child who is considered unadoptable ? A child who is no longer an infant , a child who is handicapped , a child who is in an institution because no one has loved him/her enough to keep him/her from becoming a problem child or a criminal .
