the wife of an official in the ucla athletic department lamenting the fate of the bruin football team told her husband this week we're three plays from being 6-2 replied her husband we're one play from being 2-6 indeed if ucla hadn't rallied in the last few minutes to beat san diego state coach terry donahue might be found climbing the golden gate bridge today at 1 p m instead of standing on the sideline at stanford stadium where the bruins will play the cardinal as it is ucla 3-5 still has an outside chance for a bowl bid if the bruins losers of three consecutive games for the first time since 1979, can avoid losing four in a row for the first time since 1971 and close out the regular season with victories over stanford oregon and usc they might extend their season on a more realistic note in all probability this will be ucla's most meaningless november since 1980, when the bruins were banned from postseason play by the pacific 10 conference for academic transgressions if usc beats oregon state today and arizona next week at tucson the usc-ucla game nov 18 at the coliseum will not even have a bearing on the rose bowl race donahue's task is to find a way to motivate the bruins i think what you do is you play for fun and you play for pride he said you play because you're at ucla and you have a work ethic and a standard of excellence that you accepted when you came here that's probably a lot easier said than done of course ucla a 42-7 loser at arizona three weeks ago followed that with a pair of one-point losses to oregon state and washington allowing both the beavers and the huskies to drive almost the length of the field to the game-winning points in last week's 28-27 defeat by washington the bruins squandered a 21-0 second-quarter lead who are we kidding said donahue again addressing the subject of motivation as ucla heads into its last three games our players are obviously very disappointed and upset right now so are the coaches and everybody who follows ucla football but there are lots of teams that play every week without any opportunity to do anything beyond playing out the regular season and they play hard and they play well it's unusual for us but we have to learn to do it it's my hope that we can do it well at this point though the bruins confidence might be shot it's like all these teams know it's their year to beat ucla and we know it too one player said it's like we know we stink imagine how stanford must feel if not for an improbable rally against oregon in which the cardinal turned a 17-point fourth-quarter deficit into an 18-17 victory by scoring all of its points in the last 7 minutes 19 seconds stanford would be 0-8 the cardinal has lost five consecutive games including a 19-0 defeat to usc last saturday when it managed only 140 total yards including minus-six on the ground this isn't what stanford had in mind last january when it hired dennis green to succeed jack elway as head coach but the cardinal has been beset with injuries junior quarterback brian johnson listed as probable for today's game has made only one start because of shoulder and knee injuries giving way to redshirt freshman steve smith who has completed 56.3 of his passes for 1,347 yards and seven touchdowns the cardinal running game has been hampered by the absence of all-conference halfback jon volpe who ran for 1,027 yards last season volpe has missed six consecutive games with a knee injury but is listed as probable for today obviously we're disappointed green said of stanford's worst start since 1983, when the cardinal was 1-10 we're not necessarily frustrated or discouraged but we're disappointed because we felt going into the season that we had an opportunity to play some pretty decent football and get more wins than we have right now so is ucla bruin notes shawn wills is expected to start at tailback for ucla in place of freshman kevin williams who is out with an ankle injury and did not make the trip linebacker meech shaw who missed three games with a pinched nerve in his neck is listed as probable ucla has won its last three games at stanford stadium including a 49-0 rout two years ago stanford coach dennis green is 11-52 in more than 5 1 2 seasons as a head coach including a 10-45 record in five seasons at northwestern stanford quarterbacks have been sacked 38 times in eight games ucla is a slight favorite
