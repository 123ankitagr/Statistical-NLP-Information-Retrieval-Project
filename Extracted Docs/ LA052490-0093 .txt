Santa Monica Mayor Dennis Zane 's proposed ballot measure to ease the city 's rent-control law was sent by the City Council this week to the Rent Control Board for its recommendations . Zane 's proposal , aimed at stemming the city 's rental housing losses , is designed to make the rental business more profitable and encourage landlords to keep their units on the market . It stops short of the full decontrol of rents when units are voluntarily vacated , a change that many landlords insist is needed . The measure would allow rents on vacant one-bedroom units to rise to between $ 475 and $ 525 a month . On two-bedroom units , rents could rise to between $ 600 and $ 675 a month . City officials said the current average rent of units being removed from the market is $ 355 a month . In the case of units where rents already are at or above the proposed maximums , landlords would be permitted to raise the rent by 10 % to 20 % every two to four years . In exchange for being allowed to increase rents , however , landlords would have to agree to keep their rental units on the market for at least 10 years . Zane said his proposal represents an effort to find a balance between what he calls the `` twin terrors '' of the state Ellis Act , which establishes procedures under which landlords can evict tenants and quit the rental business , and a proposed initiative backed by landlords that would end rent control for units that are voluntarily vacated . Landlords , long critical of the city 's tough rent-control policies , have used the Ellis Act to remove 1,000 units from the city 's rental market since 1986 . A competing ballot proposal by Councilman Herb Katz will also go to the rent board for recommendations . It calls for an end to rent controls upon voluntary vacancies with a catch -- landlords who charge $ 1,000 a month or more for rent would be required to donate 20 % of the rent to a city fund for low- and middle-income residents .
