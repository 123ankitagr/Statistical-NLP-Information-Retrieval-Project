Question : Sometimes the people who write health articles assume the average reader knows more than he actually does . I 've just finished an article about ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease , and I ca n't decide whether they are different names for the same disease or entirely different diseases . If they 're different , in what way ? Answer : Ulcerative colitis and Crohn 's disease are separate disorders . Ulcerative colitis is a disease that is limited to the colon or large bowel . Crohn 's disease may affect any part of the intestinal tract ; however , it often involves the small bowel . You may occasionally hear Crohn 's disease referred to as ileitis because the ileum ( the end of the small intestine ) is a common site of inflammation .
