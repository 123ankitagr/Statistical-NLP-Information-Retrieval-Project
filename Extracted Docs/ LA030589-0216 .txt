the story line for saturdays sloppy san diego section division i girls basketball championship or more appropriately the betty crocker game of the day 41 turnovers were produced was set by halftime and by games end the theme was clear mira mesa made just three field goals three not surprisingly point loma won the title 4425 at the sports arena what was surprising was that mira mesa after making just one firsthalf field goal trailed by just four at halftime 1612 and for all intents and purposes the marauders were in the game until the end of the third quarter but the final numbers were haunting mira mesa was three of 30 from the field 10 the marauders made more threepoint attempts two than twopoint attempts one and pestered by a tight point loma mantoman defense throughout they turned the ball over 25 times it was an ugly ugly game but it was a great defensive game for us point loma coach lee trepanier said they had no mantoman offense which was really too bad because theyre a better team than that indeed when unguarded mira mesa shot very well 17 of 22 from the free throw line 77 thats why the marauders were able to hang with point loma as long as they did tweet castillo made a threepoint shot and a twopointer and carrie carambas added another threepointer other than that it was all free throws mira mesa coach gary blevins was at a loss to explain we took a lot of shots they just wouldnt fall for us he said point loma was very aggressive so we shot a lot of free throws but the other shots just rolled off the rim for us point loma wasnt all that much better the pointers were 17 of 54 32 from the field and seven of 15 47 from the free throw line but point loma had monica filer a slick 5foot6 point guard to direct the offense and tyeast brown an aggressive 60 center to control the inside filer was the games leading scorer with 20 points and brown grabbed 21 rebounds to go with 10 points i was real nervous filer said i didnt settle down until halfway through the first quarter chris drumm added 10 points for point loma
