taiwan's low-cost manufacturers are being forced to relocate overseas as rising wages high land prices and a strong taiwan dollar decrease competitiveness and eat into profit margins for the price of a factory worker in taiwan we can afford to employ 10 workers in china and 12 workers in indonesia to do exactly the same job says mr frank kung general secretary of taiwan's footwear manufacturers association before 1987 most overseas investment went to the us one of taiwan's closest trading partners since 1988, however the emphasis has turned to south east asian countries offering plentiful cheap land and labour according to government figures taiwanese companies have invested about dollars 2.1 bn in asia since 1989 by july 1992, the taiwan government had approved a total of dollars 900 m for malaysia dollars 240 m for the philippines dollars 278 m for indonesia and dollars 358 m for thailand these figures do not include china where taiwanese companies have invested often illegally since 1987 although estimates vary probably more than dollars 3 bn has now flowed into the mainland together with other asian investment this makes taiwan probably the largest asian investor in the region after japan last year taiwan was the biggest foreign investor in malaysia and indonesia investing a total of dollars 602 m in textiles electronic and consumer goods and footwear poorer countries in the region have shown their willingness to encourage foreign investors vietnam has liberalised its rules on foreign investment since the late 1980 s and taiwanese companies have been quick to take advantage by july this year taiwanese investment into vietnam had reached dollars 775 m more than any other country most of the projects were in chemicals textiles bamboo and wood products and food processing taiwan's government actively encourages investment overseas since cash can buy taiwan the status and recognition it lacks in the diplomatic world indonesia the philippines and singapore have all signed investment guarantee agreements with taiwan and another is being negotiated with vietnam even though none of these countries recognises taiwan politically in an attempt to spread investment more evenly in the region taiwan's government has been plugging vietnam as a viable low-cost location direct flights between taiwan and vietnam were started in august and the kuomintang kmt s central trade development corporation along with a subsidiary has committed dollars 450 m to develop an export-processing zone and surrounding infrastructure near ho chi minh city however there are now signs taiwan's investments in south east asia may have peaked as investment into china has accelerated this mainland fever is mainly due to a cheap investment environment and common language and cultural ties china's new commitment to economic reform signalled earlier this year has also persuaded businessmen to push ahead with projects which were on hold most investment is in low-cost manufacturing and processing industries such as garments and electrical goods for export although the taiwanese started by investing in the more open economies of guangdong and fujian they are now going further afield and have even started targeting china's domestic market the government is increasingly concerned about the rate of investment in china fearing vulnerability to political and economic changes on the mainland china is also perceived as a fast-emerging competitor in the very industries that taiwan is moving across the strait the government has therefore tried to prevent heavy and high technology industries from investing in china however many observers think the recent trend for larger taiwan companies to start looking at the mainland market will only continue
