question the papers have been carrying stories about how women with breast cancer should have adjuvant therapy will you please explain what this is answer you are probably referring to a national cancer institute clinical alert which suggested that systemic adjuvant therapy may be beneficial if it is begun within six weeks of removal of a breast cancer adjuvant refers to treatment given in addition to the primary treatment in the case of breast cancer surgery is the primary treatment adjuvant therapy may consist of radiation chemotherapy or hormones in general physicians have used systemic adjuvant therapy in breast cancer patients whose lymph nodes contained cancer cells at the time they underwent surgery women whose breast cancer had not spread to lymph nodes generally did not receive systemic adjuvant therapy i would advise any of my readers who may be concerned about these stories to discuss their feelings with their physician
