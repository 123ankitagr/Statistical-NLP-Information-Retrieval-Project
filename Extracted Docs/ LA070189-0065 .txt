The United States and Taiwan initialed a tentative North Pacific drift-net agreement Friday just hours after the Taiwanese were given 60 days to sign and implement such a pact or face possible American trade sanctions on their fishery products . The agreement allows for the `` high seas boarding '' of Taiwanese drift-net vessels suspected of illegally catching U.S. salmon and requires the placement of satellite transponders on all of the 166 Taiwanese ships involved . The United States will use the transponders to keep track of the Taiwanese fleet , and U.S. observers will be allowed to board Taiwanese vessels to monitor their catch . Under a 1987 law , Thursday was the deadline for reaching such monitoring and enforcement agreements . A 60-day time clock started running ; if agreements are still not in force by the end of that period , the Bush Administration could impose an embargo or other trade sanctions on Taiwanese fishery products . State Department officials have said similar talks with South Korea may resume in July , but no definite date has been set . A previous round of talks with the Koreans in May failed to produce any progress .
