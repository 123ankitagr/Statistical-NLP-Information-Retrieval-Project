a building surge is under way on nashvilles music row the centre of americas country music industry as record companies invest millions of dollars in new or expanded offices los angelesbased songwriters have begun checking out the nashville housing market because they are thinking of moving there from the west coast and in downtown nashville work is under way on an entertainment complex which will house a country music dance clubconcert hall and a television production centre all attest to the extraordinary growth of the past few years in the country music industry which is synonymous with nashville and which is giving a substantial lift to the tennessee economy country musics share of us record sales has soared from just 68 per cent in 1989 to 175 per cent in 1993 record revenues have leapt from dollars 921m to dollars 176bn in 1993 more than 41 per cent of the us population tuned their radios to country stations compared to 342 per cent just two years earlier the format has been making big gains outside its traditional base in the american south boosters in nashville claim that country stations are now ranked number one in the ratings in such unlikely northern markets as seattle buffalo and baltimore now the industry is making a push to conquer the world garth brooks country musics most popular artist has just been on a european tour and europes first fulltime terrestrial country radio station is starting to broadcast from london it is a lucrative seachange for nashville since after a series of booms in the 1950s and 1960s country music became stuck in a rut in the early 1980s dominated by middleaged stars with a penchant for elaborate oldfashioned costumes playing music with a synthetic syrupy sound it faced a downturn in sales the turnround is due to two main forces the first is a new breed of much younger musicians with lots of sex appeal carefully cultivated by the record companies the men tend to be known collectively as new country hunks or hat acts because of the cowboy hats many of them favour they dress in plain figurehugging blue jeans both male and female artists tend to sing songs with a much simpler more traditional sound emphasising fiddles guitars and a single voice and their lyrics have a more contemporary flavour for example garth brooks the biggest phenomenon to hit the industry in decades has tackled delicate subjects such as wifebeating and date rape country has been helped by the sheer weakness and fractured nature of other pop formats ageing baby boomers find it easier to relate to country which reminds them of early 1970s rock groups such as the band and the eagles than to rap grunge or heavy metal the second important factor is the growth of cable television in the us bringing specialised country channels into homes across the nation far beyond the musics traditional heartland the nashville network which began in 1983 reaches 60m us homes it has a magazine format mixing music with programmes on other subjects which stir the soul of rural america such as bass fishing pickup trucks and drag racing its more recently established sister channel country music television cmt is in almost 25m us cable homes a 44 per cent increase in a year and reaches more than 38m homes worldwide cmt broadcasts nonstop country music pop videos both channels are owned by nashvillebased gaylord entertainment which has become to country music what walt disney is to childrens entertainment with interests ranging from theme parks to hotels at the heart of the gaylord empire lies the grand ole opry a folksy country show broadcast from nashville ever since 1925 the opry has played a crucial role in commercialising country music which stems from the folk ballads of 18th century immigrants to the appalachian mountains and in ensuring that nashville is the capital of the business the opry house where performances are held is the centrepiece of gaylords opryland complex which lies just outside nashville this also includes a theme park revolving around country music and a vast hotel particularly popular for conventions which features enormous glassenclosed gardens gaylord last year announced plans to spend dollars 175m to add 979 rooms to the existing 1891 and create another big glassed area called the delta the company is also busy in downtown nashville it is responsible for the new dance hall entertainment complex and is also renovating the interior of the ryman auditorium a tourist spot which is revered as the home of the grand ole opry from 1943 to 1974 the boom is thus having a substantial ripple effect on the wider nashville economy helping the construction hotel restaurant and transport industries eastern tennessee for its part benefits from the presence in the foothills of the great smoky mountains of pigeon forge home of dollywood a 90acre theme park owned by the most famous female star of country music dolly parton however one part of the country music surge has slipped beyond tennessees borders a thriving strip of music halls has grown up in branson missouri a small town deep in the ozark mountains which features oldtime country artists and other popular middleoftheroad entertainers some critics argue that the rise of branson is a rebuke to nashville which should have been sufficiently entrepreneurial to see there was a gap in the market for oldstyle acts the nashville establishment for its part tends to dismiss branson as being not genuinely country the biggest question facing country is how long the boom can last and whether it will be followed by a bust industry leaders are resigned to a slowing of the growth rate but many argue that country is unlikely to suffer a precipitous decline in us popularity country might also make inroads in overseas markets although some observers question whether europeans will ever warm to such a sentimental quintessentially middleamerican musical format mr david hall general manager of tnn points out that at the end of each previous period of growth industry revenues have remained higher than when the craze first began and he expects this longterm pattern to continue whereas in the past the industry was reliant on radio stations to sell its image television is a much more powerful medium for keeping america sold on country
