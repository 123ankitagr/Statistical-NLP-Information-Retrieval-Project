now that virtually all the geraniums we use for planting outdoors in summer are grown from seed it is easy to forget that there is a different and very important though much smaller trade in geraniums grown in the traditional way from cuttings this is carried out by nurseries a few of which such as the vernon geranium nursery cuddington way cheam surrey fibrex nurseries honeybourne road pebworth stratford on avon and thorp's nurseries 257 finchampstead road wokingham berkshire grow hundreds of varieties i have just received the 1992 vernon catalogue which is exceptionally well illustrated and it made me think about the varied types of geranium that are available in this way taking this catalogue as a reminder i see that vernon leads off with speckled geraniums which means speckled flowers although there are quite different varieties with speckled or netted leaves i do not know any of the nine varieties which vernon puts in this class and cannot say how the speckling arises but in most of the ivy-leaved or trailing varieties colour blotching which can be very bold is due to virus infection this though not harmful to the plants can produce variable results which are not to everyone's liking nevertheless an ivy-leaved geranium such as rouletta which combines carmine and white in varying proportions is very popular and most striking for hanging baskets window boxes and other containers still following vernon there are a few finger-flowered varieties in which the petals are quilled and the leaves deeply lobed there are also many varieties with double or semi-double flowers which i know to be highly effective in the way geranium specialists tend to have of making things rather too complicated they recognise a separate race of double-flowered varieties known as rosebud geraniums which have small very full flowers like little pompons they are pretty but i have found them difficult to grow as the flowers rot if the air is too moist then there are irene geraniums with big single flowers although their leaves can easily get too large and coarse if they are given over-rich soil the deacon geraniums are yet another double-flowered race and were all raised by the late rev s stringer many but not all appear to make exceptionally compact plants there is a great class of single geraniums in character similar to most of those we now grow so freely from seed cactus-flowered geraniums have quilled petals the vernon geranium nursery lists 18 varieties of a type which it calls stellar geraniums they seem to have no common characteristics except that they all originated from crosses made between a geranium known as chinese cactus and ordinary zonal-leaved geraniums the kind we commonly think of when geraniums are mentioned a few geraniums have cupped flowers and are known as tulip-flowered there are also old varieties with rather thin yet distinctly woody stems that are called unique geraniums and are close to the regal geraniums then there is a big section known as scented leaf geraniums which have nothing in common except the quality of having aromatic foliage which releases its scent when brushed most have insignificant flowers and many have deeply divided leaves but one named pelargonium tomentosum has big heart-shaped densely downy leaves that are strongly peppermint scented other scents are lemon apple rose nutmeg and pine there is a big class called golden foliage geraniums and another called ornamental foliage geraniums some of which have three separate bands of colour on the leaves one of the most famous of these is mrs h cox which combines bands of yellow red and black with a green centre it won a first class certificate from the royal horticultural society as long ago as 1879 there are a great many dwarf geraniums and at least as many miniatures which are even smaller just a few inches high cascade ivy-leaved geraniums are much grown on the continent and hybrid ivy-leaved geraniums are the result of crossing ordinary ivy-leaved varieties with zonals they are intermediate in habit and excellent for hanging baskets window boxes and other containers regal pelargoniums are mainly for cultivation in greenhouses and conservatories though they can be used outdoors they have large often richly-coloured flowers which are produced in late spring and early summer they can be stood outdoors when they cease to flower but need to be brought inside before there is frost in the autumn finally there are the angel geraniums which are really miniature regals and are said to be gaining in popularity it is an astonishing variety of plants to be obtained from one genus plants can be purchased as rooted cuttings or as small pot plants for many months of the year but especially in spring and early summer they are easily grown in peat or soil composts but most of the experts seem to prefer peat because of its open well-drained character they must not be allowed to freeze at any time although high temperatures are not necessary for economy in winter i set my greenhouse thermostat at 7 c and keep the plants rather dry but it would really be better to have it three or four degrees higher the biggest danger in winter is from botrytis or grey mould fungus which produces a rapid decay of stems and leaves and flourishes in cold damp air sulphur is the best remedy either spray or dust form
