bombarding tumors with high-energy neutrons instead of x-rays doubles the percentage of men who survive certain inoperable prostate cancers and could save the lives of one-fourth of those now killed by the disease scientists said last week prostate cancer is the third leading cause of cancer deaths in u s men after lung and colorectal cancer about 103,000 u s men will develop the disease this year and 28,500 who have it will die according to the american cancer society dr george laramore of the university of washington school of medicine in seattle said the study he led indicates that one-quarter of those who die each year could be saved by nationwide adoption of neutron radiation as the treatment for such men neutrons are electrically neutral particles in the nucleus or center of an atom they are massive particles while x-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation as is light beams of neutrons attack cancer cells with about 100 times the energy of x-rays laramore said the study was conducted at the university and other institutions it involved 91 men whose cancer spread beyond the prostate five years after treatment 70 of those who received neutron radiation remain alive twice the 35 survival rate among those treated with x-rays
