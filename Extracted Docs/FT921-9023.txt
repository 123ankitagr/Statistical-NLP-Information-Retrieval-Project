Sir , The arguments made by the Credit Protection Association ( CPA ) against interest on overdue commercial debts ( 'Interest on late debts attacked ' , February 5 ) are ill-informed and fundamentally flawed . Such a statute would not give customers extended credit but where unauthorised credit was taken would impose the costs incurred on the late payer . Businesses which pay late already use their suppliers as unpaid bankers ; statutory interest would make them pay for the privilege . Efficient collection of debts will , of course , still be important . But by deterring the cynical and calculating late payer , it will be easier to identify and pursue high-risk debts at an early stage .
