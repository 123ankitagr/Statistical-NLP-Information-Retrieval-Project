moving to prevent insurers from dominating their government regulator a state senator introduced legislation thursday that would prohibit the industry from contributing campaign funds to candidates for the new elective office of insurance commissioner sen gary k hart dsanta barbara told a press conference he feared that without the ban insurance companies would use campaign contributions to control an office that had been created by proposition 103 to protect consumers unless we have i think some very strict rules and regulations as it applies to contributions to this particular office we run the risk that it could in fact become basically an agent of the very industry it was established to regulate hart said among other things including a 20 premium rate rollback proposition 103 calls for the election of a state insurance commissioner beginning in 1990 currently the insurance commissioner is appointed by the governor however the provisions of proposition 103 are on hold awaiting a review of its constitutionality by the state supreme court steve barrow of california common cause a nonprofit group supporting campaign financing reform said the insurance industry already has demonstrated its ability to invest huge sums in political issues and races by pouring at least $ 65 million into last falls insurance initiative campaigns restrictions unfair however david fountain public information director for the assn of california insurance cos insisted the industry has not abused its right to make campaign donations and that it would be unfair to force restrictions on the industry why not take similar action he asked against lawyers who contribute to judicial races or bankers and bond houses that pour campaign money into races for state treasurer and controller right now its popular to jump on the bandwagon of whipping the insurance industry he said fountain questioned the constitutionality of harts bill because its prohibitions would apply to contributions from insurance agents and brokers as well as insurance companies and political action committees i dont think you can stop individuals from participating in the election process he said but barrow said similar bans had been successfully enacted in north carolina delaware and washington in all 11 states have elected insurance commissioners in states without contribution restrictions he said industry donations tend to overwhelm the election process both hart and fountain predicted the bill had a good chance of passing particularly in the political climate created by the defeat of insurance industrybacked initiatives in november besides the ban on contributions harts bill would prohibit the elected commissioner from accepting speaking fees and from taking a job in the insurance industry for two years after leaving office the bill also would require candidates for insurance commissioner to disclose all income sources for the two years before filing for office
