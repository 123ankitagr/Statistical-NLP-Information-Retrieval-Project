on the eve of president bill clinton's visit to seoul a senior south korean official said yesterday his country should ultimately be responsible for solving north korea's nuclear problem rather than the us the denuclearisation of the korean peninsula has to be realised through dialogue and consultations between south and north korea said mr han wan-sang the national unification minister in apparent response to domestic criticism that seoul is relying too much on washington in trying to halt north korea's nuclear weapons programme the issue is expected to head the list of topics to be discussed between mr clinton and south korean president kim young-sam at the weekend the present crisis has set back hopes in seoul that the problems of denuclearisation and eventual unification might be solved between the two koreas without involving other regional powers including the us china japan and russia that has been considered a desirable goal from seoul's perspective because it would symbolise south korea's autonomy in deciding its own fate after a century of being dominated by outside powers besides relying on the us to intercede directly with pyongyang seoul could see the issue slip further from its control if the un security council becomes involved which might include imposing economic sanctions on north korea if it does not accept full iaea inspections the clinton visit however could counter criticism that seoul is playing a secondary role as the us president will be seen consulting the south korean government on the nuclear issue in a face-saving gesture seoul is also proposing again that north-south talks should be held in parallel with the negotiations between pyongyang and washington a previous attempt to stage inter-korean talks on the nuclear problem collapsed over procedural issues mr han emphasised the importance of seoul's position as an intermediary between the us and north korea if north korea gives up nuclear development and guarantees nuclear transparency south korea will be able to help north korea actively to improve relations with the us and japan he explained
