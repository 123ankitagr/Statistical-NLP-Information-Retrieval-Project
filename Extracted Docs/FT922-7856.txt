if you are in your midthirties and would like to work in brussels for the european commission dont bother to apply the trouble is the commission says that people approaching 40 do not have long enough careers ahead of them this means that most of its jobs carry age limits of 32 or 35 the policy however came under sharp attack yesterday from britains new employment minister 37yearold mr michael forsyth he said it was stupid because it prevented the recruitment of people offering many productive years the minister accused the commission of ageism widely considered a regressive employment practice the uk has more often been on the receiving end of such allegations mr forsyths remarks underline indications by mrs gillian shephard employment secretary that tackling age discrimination will be a priority when the uk takes over the european community presidency in july the uk employment department has however ruled out legislation against ageism the approach favoured in the us sometimes we are accused of being reluctant europeans because we do not believe that piling on regulation is the way forward said mr forsyth best practice as outlined by the institute of personnel management is for employers to specify no age limits in adverts or ask for ages on application forms mr forsyth told a recruitment industry meeting in london the commission has set an age limit of just 35 on most jobs whether you wish to join as a lawyer or as a messenger he accepted the need for age limits sometimes but said blanket bans could not be justified the commission says its aim is to recruit individuals who can look forward to a career progression of a sufficient period of time it may now review the practice of specifying age limits in its recruitment literature besides it says a few senior staff as old as 55 are in any case recruited and there is no age limit for roughly a third of staff who are on temporary contracts
