Miss Brio came from slightly off the pace to upset 1988 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors in the $ 111,800 Maskette Handicap Saturday at Belmont Park in Elmont , N.Y. Winning Colors , the odds-on choice , tired abruptly after leading to the stretch and finished fourth in the field of five , creating unusually high show payoffs . Miss Brio , ridden by Jerry Bailey , won by 1 1/4 lengths and returned $ 8.80 to win , $ 5.20 to place and $ 14.00 to show . Proper Evidence paid $ 5.60 and $ 15.00 , and Aptostar returned $ 12.80 .
