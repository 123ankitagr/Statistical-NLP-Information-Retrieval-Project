Taiwan , easing restrictions on economic ties with China , has drafted regulations which will let local banks deal directly with their Chinese counterparts , government officials said yesterday , Reuter reports from Taipei . Overseas branches of Taiwanese banks will be allowed to negotiate letters of credit and foreign exchange remittances with Chinese banks , officials of the Monetary Affairs Bureau said . At present , Taiwanese banks can only deal with Chinese financial institutions through foreign banks . Vice-Finance Minister Lee Chung-ying told reporters the reform would assist the flow of funds between the two sides and make it easier for Taiwanese banks to profit from the rapid growth of trade and investment . However , Taiwan will continue to ban its banks from setting up branches inside China .
