dubai has never been simply a gulf oil town although oil money has fertilised its fast growth in the past 25 years in character it has always kept much more the feel of a traders haven oil and gas in fact came later to dubai than most gulf states and when it was discovered and exploited in the late 1960s there was less of it the emirates reserves of 4bn barrels of recoverable oil are modest by the standards of some gulf peers and dwarfed by the 98bn barrels beneath the sands of abu dhabi its rival emirate down the coast by most estimates dubais oil will run out within the next 20 or so years barring large finds which oil industry executives in the city presume unlikely the impetus behind dubais economy is therefore the governments determination to diversify the emirates sources of income as fast and ambitiously as possible otherwise as a local banker puts it when the oil dries up so will dubai while it lasts dubai is pumping oil for all it is worth and with characteristic distaste for any external restraints on its behaviour pumping to capacity regardless of any opec quotas for the united arab emirates as a whole at present the emirate is lifting around 440000 barrels a day rather than nurture its oil endowment a policy which dubais rulers have decided would only postpone slightly a far less prosperous future dubai has instead tended to reap what it can now to invest in ventures which will sustain its buoyancy when the wells dry up the emirates nonoil sector already accounts for around 60 per cent of its gross national product which stood at dh123bn last year although this proportion varies somewhat according to the prevailing oil price but dubais oil income has always been disproportionately important as the wellspring of its investment strategy this broadly put amounts to pouring money marketing and as much imagination as it can muster into making it an unavoidable trading hub for the middle east and preferably somewhat beyond and the regions most desirable place to set up manufacturing plants in this ambition dubai has been blessed both by location and tradition in the days of dhows and steamers dubais natural creek quickly became the gulfs busiest port in the late nineteenthcentury soon after it was settled by a branch of the bani yas tribe led by the maktoum family who still rule dubai with the advent of air travel dubai found itself conveniently sited midway between europe and asia and offering cheap aviation fuel a natural stopover point last year 44m passengers used its airport an average of 12000 daily in the early days moreover the maktoums liberal hospitality offered to a large number of arabs and persians across the waters a more profitable home from which to trade than persia itself which imposed severe restrictions on trade in the early 1900s these merchants later joined by hundreds from india and the subcontinent still form the core of dubais thriving merchant class which has defined the citys character trade with iran the porous coastline and closed economy of which helped turn dubai into a bustling smugglers nest helped keep dubais port alive after the demise of the pearling industry in the late 1920s gold food and all manner of other goods also found their way from dubais creek to the ports of india pakistan and to other gulf ports but with the arrival of oil and a boom which saw dubais population double between 1967 and 1973 to 120000 people highrise buildings began to spring up amid the palmfrond houses the city states late ruler sheikh rashid bin maktoum began to define the longerterm strategy carried on today by his sons in an infrastructural binge during the late 1960s and 1970s the manmade port rashid was opened in 1972 bridges were built over the creek the airport expanded and in 1979 dubai created the 67berth deepwater harbour of jebel ali 30km south of dubai complete with an enveloping 100 sq km free trade zone opened in 1985 in which foreign companies could operate as 100 per cent owners virtually unprecedented in the region and pay no tax repatriate all profits and also profit from cheap land labour and power the result has been to turn dubai into far and away the gulfs busiest trading centre between them port rashid and jebel ali which combined under the single dubai ports authority dpa in a rationalisation last year handled 125m teu 20foot equivalent units essentially containers making dpa the worlds 19th busiest container port japan the biggest purchaser of dubais oil and its main supplier of cars and electronics goods is the emirates main trading partner but the greater part of dubais imports are then reexported predominantly to iran and to a lesser extent elsewhere in the arabian peninsular dubai officially accounts for 6070 per cent of the united arab emirates reexports a figure which most likely underestimates the true picture given that many of its imports are also reexported by other emirates dubai also opened a 25000 sq metre air cargo village in july last year to corner the regions seaair freight business and is intent on chasing seattles crown as the worlds fastest and busiest seaair freight terminal in keeping with its determination to become the regions unavoidable hub dubai also set up emirates its own airline in 1985 a move met with some scepticism given that gulf air jointly owned by oman qatar bahrain and abu dhabi was already well established in the region but such scepticism has not deterred the airline from a sustained pattern of growth which in june saw it sign deals to add seven boeing 777s to its present fleet of 11 aircraft with an option on seven more and with a further five airbus jets due for delivery from july although the airline publishes no figures its managers insist it is already returning an operating profit while dubai has soared away from its local competitors as a trading centre it has had the same mixed success as elsewhere in the region in attracting manufacturing investment on its own initiative dubai created the dubal aluminium smelter one of a growing number in the gulf where lowcost energy makes sense of such ventures which last year neared its expansion target output of 240000 tonnes a year but while jebel ali into which the government invested dollars 25bn had attracted 410 companies by june this year and was registering new entrants at the rate of 1012 a month the majority are either distribution or packaging companies or attendant light industries jebel ali is still waiting for a big multinational investor to select the free zone as a big manufacturing base jebel ali has not turned out to be the white elephant some critics branded it at its conception nevertheless it has far to go before it fulfils sheikh rashids forwardlooking ambition just over 5 per cent of its space is taken up so far and although the zone has capacity to absorb 8000 companies mr sultan bin sulayem the dpa chairman says the port reckons conservatively that there will be 2000 in place by the turn of the century as to why no leading multinational has yet taken the plunge at jebel ali mr sulayem suggests that it is simply a question of awareness too few companies have yet focused on the potential of the region he argues dubai is moving heaven and large quantities of earth to try to rectify the problem not only has the government set up the dubai commerce and tourism board now represented in seven foreign cities to market the city energetically the emirate has also sought to attract world class sporting events such as the dubal desert classic golf tournament the first round of the pga circuit worldranking car rallies and snooker competitions to draw the attention of potential investors the citys two grassed golf courses the second of which will soon be completed along the banks of dubais creek and the first of which was the also the first of its kind in the region have been built primarily to help attract foreign investors the emirates rulers know well how much japanese businessmen like to play golf yet awareness of what dubai has to offer and besides golf it also has perhaps the most liberal and probusiness government in the gulf may not be enough to guarantee the kind of investment the emirate needs to escape the shackle of diminishing oil revenues japanese investors for example also like cheap labour and while the predominantly asian workers abundant in dubai cost far less than in any developed country they are more expensive to hire in dubai than in asia itself where japanese companies prefer to invest anyway for their own cultural reasons another uncertain cloud over dubais development is the future of iran which having gratefully used the emirates busy services as an entrepot throughout the iraniraq war and since is now rather ungratefully trying to develop its own dutyfree and development zones at qeshm and kish islands near the straits of hormuz the recent reshuffling of irans exchange rates has already hurt some of dubais traders and opinion in the city is mixed as to the likely effects on dubai of irans determination to open its economy and develop its own trade either you believe that this will irrevocably reduce trade with the emirates biggest single market or that a bigger more prosperous iranian economy can only even with a smaller dubai share mean more trade for the emirate last year for instance reexports to iran rose 8 per cent by value but fell 19 per cent by volume the jury is out on that as with the eventual success or otherwise of dubais strenuous attempts to replace its oil revenues but dubai can not be blamed for not trying
