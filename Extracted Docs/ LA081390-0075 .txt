some people in orange county are apparently not listening too much sun is not good for you sun worshipers who frolic on the countys beaches without protection from the glare of cloudless skies may very likely get skin cancer doctors at uc irvines melanoma center say they know they sound like a broken record but they figure many outdoors types in this county are still not paying attention and now they have more evidence of that during a skin cancer screening offered by the center during april and may 1 of every 5 persons was diagnosed with skin cancer while almost a third had precancerous lesions numbers that alarmed some doctors and others at the center we were really amazed at what we saw said leslie ann cyril a spokesperson for the center melanomas are being discovered in much younger people thats whats so surprising dr matthew goodman codirector of the melanoma center cautioned that these results are not an accurate measure of skin cancer prevalence among the general population nor was this meant as a scientific study the 175 people who were screened he said probably likely suspected they might have a problem with skin abnormalities including skin cancer however he said results of this screening echo trends in national studies showing that skin cancer is on the rise especially among people who live in sunny southern california it reiterates the need to use good judgment in our sun habits and the use of a sun screen with an spf sun protection factor of 15 or greater he said it shows that it could happen to you he also said it is an indication that there is still a great need for better educational programs warning about the dangers of the sun in this county of sunny beaches and endless summers the melanoma center which opened in 1986 at the uci clinical cancer center and is the only such center in orange county has started some educational programs for elementary school children cyril said the american cancer society estimates that 60000 people will develop skin cancer during 1990 a 4 increase from last year of those 27600 will be diagnosed with melanoma the most serious form and the cancer society estimates that 6300 people will die from melanoma this year that is why matthews said he could not overstate the need for caution and prevention the cancer center plans to offer another screening in the fall he said and he encouraged people in orange county especially those who engage in outdoor activity to get themselves checked out in my opinion it is related to the popularity of the masses going to the beach and other outdoor recreation as much as they have in the last few years almost to a fanatic extreme he said well dont say fanatic extreme because i think outdoor recreation is great and good but people should be prudent but dore gilbert a newport beach dermatologist said he thinks people living along the coast are wellinformed about the dangers of overexposure the higher incidence of skin cancer and melanoma cases he said could reflect an increased awareness among people who are seeking medical help earlier before it is too late in this area in orange county and also in los angeles people are very aware of melanoma he said if you get out to more rural areas areas away from the coast you are going to find more people who say it cant happen to me those he said are the people to worry about
