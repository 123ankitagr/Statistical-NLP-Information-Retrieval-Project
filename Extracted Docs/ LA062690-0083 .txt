americans need look chinese japanese southern italians see eat far much fat say authors several recent studies pointing strong connection dietary fat particular types cancers dietary fat fondly found goodies ice cream avocados wellknown contributor heart disease diabetes high blood pressure now evidence accumulating contributes mightily cancers particularly breast colorectal cancer possibly prostate pancreatic ovarian cancer while physicians know dietary fat increases deposits blood vessels cause heart disease much less known fat contributes cancer but mystery hasnt held back health experts strong recommendations americans reduce dietary fat perhaps even current recommendation 30 total daily calories the fat story real says clifford welsch pharmacology toxicology professor michigan state university there overwhelming evidence experimental animals amount type dietary fat markedly affects cancer process but strong evidence also exists outside laboratory health experts note and comparison diets countries convinces many health experts americans eat far much fat a new study cites highfat diets lack exercise higher rates colorectal cancer chineseamericans compared chinese living china a study italy shows twofold increases breast cancer rates northern italy diets much higher fat compared southern italy studies show japanese women consume less fat lower breast cancer rates better breastcancer survival rates maybe comes back ate million years ago probably ate 10 calories fat ate 50 80 grams fiber day exercised lot says dr ernst l wynder president american health foundation private research group the foundation estimates half cancers women third cancers men related dietary fat i believe major cause disease excessive exposure fat wynder says when comes fat i believe system developed handle 100 grams fat day most americans consume 40 daily calories fat health experts generally agree fat limited 30 total daily calories the health foundation however taken extreme view suggesting fat make 25 less daily diet the emerging studies important part cancers appear influenced dietary fat major problems united states other common skin cancers incidence colorectal cancer ranks second lung cancer united states the american cancer society estimates 155000 new cases reported year breast cancer affects one every 10 women i think people well aware role dietary fat heart disease data havent strong dietary fat cancer says stanford epidemiologist alice whittemore coauthor fiveyear study chinese populations i think thats changing though the data beginning come quite conclusively large bowel cancers fat important factor i think important publichealth message a rate colorectal cancer four five times higher among chineseamericans among chinese living china strongly linked diet high saturated fats sedentary lifestyle whittemores group stanford researchers university southern california reported study published month journal national cancer institute exercise thought help reduce incidence cancer speeding movement food intestinal tract the two factors high saturatedfat diet lack exercise working together harmful whittemore says i believe message everyone needs hear chinese studies comparing rate breast cancer countries equally compelling wynder says besides comparison breast cancer rates italy studies show japanese women consume less fat lower rates breast cancer the link dietary fat breast cancer strong enough researchers studying whether breast cancer patients might better survival rates adopt lowerfat diets wynder says studies shown japanese women develop breast cancer much better survival rates a leading theory breastcancer development holds increases hormone estrogen contributes cancer dietary fat raises estrogen levels hormones thought play role cancers well a new approach cancer treatment can treat cancer lowfat diet wynder says in opinion dietary fat plays role promotion breast cancer also terms metastasis a study funded national cancer institute way seven institutions explore whether postmenopausal women treated breast cancer better survival rates consume diet less 20 fat this certainly worthwhile trial wynder says and one thing say nutrition its toxic its costly and almost anyone the women trial complying diet well my hunch work cancer breast also work hormonerelated cancers particularly cancer prostrate possibly ovary endometrian it certainly doesnt relate cancers preliminary results 20 patients study show 60 drop particular type estrogen wynder one strongest advocates nutritional changes reduce cancer rates says tough convincing peers study value when comes nutrition treat breast cancer people says hokey ive difficult time convincing colleagues nutrition could part treatment but others caution soon implicate diet major factor development cancers one comprehensive recent studies diet breast cancer nurses example showed relationship the study criticized however nurses consuming diets 32 44 fat thought experts high make difference breast cancer rates others suggest diets may help prevent cancer many factors contribute cancer development survival rates i think difference way individual responds says paul newberne mallory institute pathology boston overall i think nutrition going help us prevent cancer rather cure and i dont think try oversell something public cant really deliver experts agree must learn fat could contribute cancer some researchers suggest saturated fat culprit others say calories fat responsible there whole array ideas fat might enhance cancer processes dont know definitively important says michigan states welsch i feel major impact dietary fat happens calories derived fat studies shown colorectal cancer generally consume calories healthy people but stanfordusc study among first strongly implicate saturated fat contributor colorectal cancer because variations chinese diets researchers able link saturated fat higher rates colorectal cancer this strongest association weve seen unequivocally pulled saturated fat culprit whittemore says other studies soon released support relationship said whittemore also suggests new evidence might lead health officials recommend reductions dietary fat 30 total calories we found lowest risk among chinese consumed 10 grams saturated fat per day 100 calories whittemore says it could well cut even reducing dietary fat choose lean meat fish poultry dry beans peas protein sources use skim lowfat milk milk products moderate use egg yolks organ meats limit intake fats oils especially high saturated fat butter cream lard heavily hydrogenated fats margarines shortenings foods containing palm coconut oils trim fat meats broil bake boil rather fry moderate use foods contain fat breaded deepfried
