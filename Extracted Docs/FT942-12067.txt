South Korean President Kim Young-sam yesterday ordered increased surveillance of North Korean military movements in response to its threat to disband the military armistice commission . South Korean defence forces were placed on temporary alert on Saturday after between 15 and 20 North Korean aircraft were detected flying close to the demilitarised zone between the two Koreas . The aircraft manoeuvres indicated increased military exercises by North Korea . North Korea has threatened to pull out of the military armistice commission , which supervises the truce that ended the Korean War of 1950-53 , unless the US holds negotiations with Pyongyang on a peace treaty to replace the 40-year old armistice agreement . The US has refused the demand , explaining the dispute over North Korean nuclear inspections must be resolved first . Western diplomats in Seoul believe that North Korea is using the peace treaty proposal as a new bargaining chip in the international negotiations over nuclear inspections .
