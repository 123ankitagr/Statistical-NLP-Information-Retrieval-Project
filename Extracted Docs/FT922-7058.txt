SENIOR civil servants throughout Whitehall had been informally reminded that any prospective departmental moves should take account of the 'attractive options ' that might be on offer in Docklands , Downing Street said yesterday . In line for a move to Docklands are the departments of the environment and transport , whose Marsham Street offices in Westminster are due to be demolished next year . Ministers continue to emphasise that any move to Docklands would have to be made on value for money grounds and not as a 'bail-out ' for troubled Canary Wharf developer Olympia & York .
