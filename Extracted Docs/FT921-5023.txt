THE use of CFCs in manufacturing is acknowledged to be one of the prime causes of ozone 'holes ' in the stratosphere , and many governments have drawn up schedules for their elimination . Thermo Electron Technologies of San Diego , California , has developed a miniaturised thermoelectric cooling module which employs semiconductor elements in place of CFCs . These are sturdier than conventional cooling units . Potential uses include cooling electronic components in aircraft , air conditioning systems in cars and producing slimmer wall-mounted air conditioners for homes . Meanwhile , NEC of Japan has developed a new technology which aids the examination of integrated circuit ( IC ) print boards for organic residues after they have been washed with substitutes for traditionally-used CFCs . NEC claims its technology , which uses filtered light from a mercury lamp , is simpler , quicker and more accurate than earlier alternatives and should contribute towards the evaluation of CFC substitutes in IC production .
