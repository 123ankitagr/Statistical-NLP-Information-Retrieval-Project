The British have a traditional affection for warm beer and muggy offices but just as cooled lagers have frozen out many traditional ales , so more and more businesses are turning to air conditioning , writes Charles Batchelor . This can make sense even in Britain 's unpredictable climate because the sun 's rays on large city centre offices cause them to store heat and can push internal temperatures up to 10 degrees higher than those outside . Often the only affordable way to obtain the effects of air conditioning in many older and smaller offices is to install a mobile air conditioner . What to Buy for Business * lists 16 suppliers and 44 different machines in a review of air conditioners in its June edition . A mobile air conditioner will not achieve the same uniform degree of coolness as a built-in system and many of the benefits will be lost if a window has to be opened to allow the exhaust hose to vent into the open air . But they can be used as spot coolers by one or two desks . Users will face a choice between water cooled air conditioners , which require topping up and more elaborate maintenance , or the air cooled variety which have recently become more popular . What to Buy selects three best buys ranging in price from Pounds 700 to Pounds 1,495 and six good value models from Pounds 599 to Pounds 1,325 . However , it estimates that buyers should be able to negotiate a 20 per cent discount on one-off purchases and suggests renting for short-term use . A week 's rent usually works out at one-tenth of the purchase price . The unpredictability of the British weather means it is difficult to predict when you may need to rent and renting or buying in the middle of a heatwave will make it difficult to obtain the best deal . * Central House , 27 Park Street , Croydon , Surrey , CR0 1YD .
