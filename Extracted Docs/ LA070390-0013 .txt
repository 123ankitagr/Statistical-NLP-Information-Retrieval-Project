Concerned about a sharp rise in traffic along California 126 , the Fillmore City Council has authorized a $ 45,000 traffic study of the portion of the highway that passes through the city . According to a city staff report , traffic on the highway near A Street increased from an average of 17,000 daily trips in April , 1988 , to about 25,000 trips in May , 1989 . City Manager Roy Payne said Fillmore must differentiate between locally generated and `` pass-through '' traffic to better determine whether future development is a good idea . Payne said pollution caused by local traffic was considered to be within the limits set by state and county standards , but increased use of California 126 would affect the overall picture . The study , which the city hopes to complete in four months , will serve as a necessary part of environmental analysis required by the city 's proposed development of the North Fillmore Industrial Park . It will also speed decisions on future residential developments and on commercial uses proposed along the highway . Solutions for congestion problems along the highway could include improvements at intersections or increasing the number of signals on California 126 as it passes through the city , Payne said . Because the city has no control over the amount of traffic originating outside the city limits , the study may indicate problems that can not be mitigated , Payne said . Although this would not necessarily call a halt to growth in Fillmore , the city would have to address traffic and air quality issues , and `` development could be affected , '' Payne said .
