The conglomerate 's debts and the row over how they should be repaid was widely blamed for undermining Italy 's credibility in financial markets during its worst economic crisis in years . A statement from the office of Mr Giuliano Amato , prime minister , said the government was now prepared to cover the debts of Efim and companies it controlled 100 per cent . 'The cabinet has put at the disposition of ( Efim 's ) liquidator finances to pay the corporation 's debts and those of the companies that were 100 per cent owned , ' a statement said . Efim controls about 140 companies , not all wholly-owned , ranging from helicopter-makers to glass manufacturers , and those only partially owned may not be covered by the decree . According to recent testimony by Mr Alberto Predieri , Efim liquidator , Nuova Safim , a 100 per cent-owned sub-holding company , owed 90 per cent of the money lent by foreigners . Efim 's debts to foreign and domestic lenders and suppliers are L17,500bn .
