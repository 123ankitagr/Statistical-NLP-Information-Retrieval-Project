A standard blood test for kidney functioning may indicate a heightened risk of dying within eight years among people with high blood pressure , a study suggests . The study , of 10,768 people with high blood pressure , found that those with high levels of creatinine , a waste product produced by muscle tissue , in their blood showed higher death rates from heart attack and stroke as well as kidney disease , the researchers said . Death rates rose with rising creatinine levels . Kidneys normally remove creatinine from blood , so high levels can signal kidney trouble . The work by researchers at several medical schools is presented in the May issue of the journal Hypertension .
