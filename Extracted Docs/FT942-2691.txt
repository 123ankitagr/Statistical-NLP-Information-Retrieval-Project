As the South Korean team trudged disconsolately off the field after their final World Cup qualifying match in Doha , it seemed that their 3-0 win over North Korea would not be enough to take them to the US . News had filtered through that Japan were beating Iraq 2-1 . Then the scoreboard flashed a scoreline that could change the face of South Korean football . Iraq had scored an injury time equaliser . South Korea and not Japan had qualified . There was pandemonium on the pitch among the players , but for the officials looking on the result meant much more . South Korea is locked in a battle with Japan to host the 2002 World Cup . The Japanese were hoping that qualification would strengthen their case , but Korea can now boast five World Cup finals appearances ( including one by North Korea in 1966 ) to Japan 's none . There is a strong professional league in South Korea , run by the big industrial corporations who own the clubs , and because of this most of the Korean squad play their football in Korea , although 28 year old Kim Joo-Sung has experience with Germany 's VfL Bochum . Kim , twice Asian Footballer of the Year , is the pivot around which the side functions . South Korea are strong in defence and , in 1993 , kept 15 clean sheets in internationals , but they do not possess a striker with a lot of experience or goals to his credit .
