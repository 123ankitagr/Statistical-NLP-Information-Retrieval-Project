A flood of good will from blood donors in Orange County and other areas of the state has given the Red Cross more than enough blood to send to the earthquake-stricken San Francisco Bay Area , officials said Saturday . Joan Mueller , a spokeswoman for the Orange County chapter of the Red Cross , said that the county 's three blood collection centers in Santa Ana , Anaheim and Huntington Beach were flooded with donors after Tuesday 's 6.9-magnitude temblor . More than 3,000 people were injured in the earthquake . On Wednesday and Thursday , Red Cross workers collected 1,906 pints of blood , far surpassing a normal two-day total of 600 pints . Red Cross also collected more than $ 114,000 in Orange County . `` The reports we have received indicated that the blood needs have been met in San Francisco , '' Mueller said . `` It was a critical time , but the need has been met . '' Mueller said she was elated by the response . She said that on Wednesday , an Anaheim computer store owner closed his business and accompanied his employees to the nearest center to give blood .
