sir mr j a nightingale chairman of the apparel knitting and textiles alliance calls letters november 30 on developing countries to lift their barriers to textiles and clothing in exchange for the phasing-out of the multi-fibre arrangement mfa the mfa is a legalised derogation from the general agreement on tariffs and trade imposed on developing countries as a temporary measure 20 years ago imposing unilateral restrictions and then using them as a bargaining chip to get access to developing nations markets amounts to heavy-handed tactics not at all conducive to good trading relations at punta del este to which mr nightingale refers governments in fact agreed to ensure that developing countries received differential and more favourable treatment their declaration stated developed countries do not expect reciprocity in their reduction of barriers to trade to developing countries that is they do not expect developing countries to make contributions which are inconsistent with the individual development financial and trade needs ending the mfa is one of the few benefits which the gatt proposal offers developing countries diluting those gains by further extending the mfa or pressing for yet more reciprocal actions options which president clinton is now exploring would seriously undermine their economic prospects mr nightingale is right to call for serious bargaining but surely instead of trying to wring yet more concessions out of poor countries his industry would do better to focus on the tariffs ranging from 35 to 60 per cent imposed on european textiles by south africa australia or the us harriet lamb campaigns officer world development movement 25 beehive place london sw9
