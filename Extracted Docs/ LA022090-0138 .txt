Britain 's Prince Charles put down his polo mallet for a film role as he continued his efforts for wildlife conservation during a visit to Florida . Charles made an animal conservation film for the British Broadcasting Corp. during a three-hour visit Monday to the Kennedy Space Center . Filming took place at a national wildlife refuge , part of the 88,000-acre space center and home to eagles and hundreds of other bird species , alligators , wild pigs , deer and other wildlife . Forrest McCartney , space center director , also escorted Charles on a tour of the shuttle launch control center and an assembly building . The group saw from a distance the launch pad where the shuttle Atlantis is being readied for liftoff Thursday . During the three days preceding his visit to the cape , the heir to the British throne was in Vero Beach , where he participated in two polo matches to benefit a wildlife protection organization . Charles is scheduled to attend a conference on international business beginning today in Charleston , S.C. , and to travel to Washington later this week to meet with President Bush and British Embassy officials .
