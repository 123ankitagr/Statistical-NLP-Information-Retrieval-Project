The beds have n't been made and the cupboards are still bare , but by Wednesday the Ronald McDonald House will be ready for its grand opening . It will be a home away from home for families of seriously ill children at Childrens Hospital of Orange County and other area hospitals . Children undergoing outpatient treatment may stay there as well . Families will pay $ 5 a night to stay in the powder-blue and white , three-story house on Batavia Street in Orange , said Herb Watson , executive director of the house . Those who can not afford the fee will stay for free . Families will be referred to the house by social service workers at local hospitals . About 8 % to 10 % of children treated at CHOC for serious illnesses live outside the area , Watson said . The Orange County Ronald McDonald house will join 125 others worldwide , five of them in California . But it will be the first in the world to open debt-free , thanks to more than 400 individuals and organizations who have donated money , time and supplies , Watson said . Donations are still being received , and the house is registered with the Broadway 's bridal registry . The actual cost of buying the land and building and supplying the house would have been about $ 2.4 million But more than $ 1 million was donated in goods and services , and the other million in cash came from donors , including Mary Moore Young of Fullerton , who gave $ 500,000 in memory of her husband , William . He founded Golden State Food Co. , a food supplier for McDonald 's . The mattresses , the kitchen appliances , washers and dryers , the floor covering and much of the furniture was donated . The house has 20 bedrooms , a living room , dining room , library , play room , sanctuary , back yard with playground equipment and apartment for the live-in manager , Martha Winslow . SHANNON SANDS
