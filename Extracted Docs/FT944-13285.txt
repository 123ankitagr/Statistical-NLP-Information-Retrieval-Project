Age discrimination by employers and recruiters should be against the law , a pressure group said yesterday . Mr Richard Worsley , director of the Carnegie Third Age Programme , which deals with issues concerning older people , said there was a need for one law to tackle discrimination in employment . Mr Worsley told the Harrogate conference that unjustified age discrimination was preventing the 14m people in Britain aged between 50 and 74 from making an important contribution to the economy . Government consultation on proposals for legislation to end discrimination against disabled people , he said , held out the possibility that age discrimination would be neglected and unregulated , outside the equal opportunities agenda .
