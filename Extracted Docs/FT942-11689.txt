philadelphia loves a comeback story it is a spirit epitomised in the movies by rocky balboa the washedup palooka who made the most of his last big shot to be somebody in real life there is no finer example than the impressive turnround by sun company one of the stalwarts of philadelphias old industrial base in 1991 the 108yearold energy group the fourth biggest company in the region was a flabby underachiever weighed down by a bloated portfolio of peripheral businesses overall its operations were producing a meagre 2 per cent return on equity just two years later the company is showing a return on equity of 10 per cent having transformed itself into a lean contender with good prospects of sustained growth they have identified where they have the best chance to be profitable says mr george baker an analyst at merrill lynch in new york in doing so they have gone a long way towards making the company a more focused enterprise sun has gone a long way in setting itself apart from its rivals too more than any other big energy group it has emphasised a commitment to safe and sustainable environmental practices it was the first fortune 500 company to endorse the principles of the coalition of environmentally responsible economies a nonprofit organisation set up after the exxon valdez oilspill to promote green business policies on a smaller scale sun has put a human face on its corporate image with several innovative programmes including an offer to buy and junk wornout cars which are heavy polluters in a small step which may symbolise the fresh approach its headquarters was brought back to downtown market street after 23 years exile in the suburb of radnor nostalgia however had less to do with the relocation than did a desire to cut costs the move was part of a comprehensive streamlining implemented soon after mr robert campbell took over as chairman and chief executive in 1992 under the new regime the company has shifted its focus back to its traditional strengths refining and marketing in the northeast in its core operating region sun commands 14 per cent of the retail petrol trade the second largest share behind mobil branded petrol accounts for 37 per cent of total sales by far the companys most important revenue generator sun hopes to build on these strengths concurrently the group has withdrawn from the areas where it was taking a beating it finally threw in the towel on most of its international exploration operations after spinning off its us exploration and production in 1988 in drilling for oil and gas we had a horrible record admits mr robert aiken chief financial officer the company is still involved in international crude production which remains profitable coal mining and real estate were deemed losing propositions too in suns continuing operations expenses were slashed and the workforce reduced by 20 per cent to 14000 so far the results have exceeded mr campbells goals sun posted operating profit of dollars 193m last year against dollars 30m ayear earlier the figure is well ahead of his target of achieving a dollars 150m improvement the company was again able to tap operating income in paying its dividend another of the chairmans ambitions analysts are divided about some of the companys specific moves and point out that its recovery is part of cyclical upturn by the industry as a whole but most agree that the overall strategy is sound sun wins plaudits for securing longterm leases to operate filling stations along the pennsylvania turnpike the company also gained exclusive rights to sell petrol along the new jersey turnpike perhaps the most travelled highway in america the high visibility of operating along such motorways carries benefits that exceed the revenues they directly generate analysts say meanwhile filling stations in the midwest have been sold underperforming outlets in the northeast have been pared from its 3000strong network a move to integrate its branded petrol offerings under a single banner sunoco is also expected to pay off in higher margins a critical factor in petrol retailing where demand at best grows a scant 1 per cent a year the group also put a feather in its cap by agreeing to buy a chevron refining plant located on property adjacent to its main philadelphia facility the bargainbasement price of dollars 170m made the deal an easy sell even though the potential environmental remediation costs which sun may face have yet to be quantified says mr john hilton an analyst at argus research in new york such investments are usually just shots in the dark says mr james murchie who follows the industry for sanford c berstein in new york he argues that future demand and margins on refined products are nearly impossible to gauge refining a costly necessity for a marketer of petroleum products continues to be a drag on suns bottom line accounting for dollars 80m in operating losses last year still the chevron acquisition was a safe bet says mr murchie indeed if the deal had been completed before this winters deep freeze which brought a sharp increase in demand for heating oil the investment would have already paid for itself
