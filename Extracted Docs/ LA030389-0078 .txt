A Los Angeles federal judge has rejected a request to overturn a $ 566,000 jeopardy assessment by the Internal Revenue Service against the holdings of former federal drug agent Darnell Garcia , a fugitive since Nov. 22 in a major drug corruption probe . U.S. District Judge William J. Rea rejected a petition by the ex-agent 's wife , Adeline Garcia , despite noting that he had `` many questions about the government 's case '' in moving to seize Garcia 's assets . A hearing on the tax matter produced testimony that IRS agents filed the tax lien after being told that alleged associates of Garcia and `` somebody '' resembling Garcia had 150 kilograms of cocaine for sale in 1985 . The IRS estimated the income from the sale at $ 3.4 million and based the assessment on that figure . Attorney Mark Borenstein , representing Adeline Garcia , had urged Rea to `` at least '' reduce the assessment to $ 49,000 allegedly owed in taxes for 1985 . Borenstein said the case will be taken to the U.S. Tax Court . At issue is whether the government can seize Garcia 's $ 581,000 home in Rancho Palos Verdes . The former agent is charged with conspiring to sell cocaine and heroin with two other former U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agents , John Anthony Jackson and Wayne Countryman .
