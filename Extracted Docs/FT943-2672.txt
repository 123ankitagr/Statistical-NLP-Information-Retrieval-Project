it takes just one blow of a steamboat whistle on the quay at new orleans to find yourself transported into the storybook past of the mississippi paddleboats like multi-tiered wedding cakes they churned the muddy waters with their giant wheels transporting men in sunday suits and women in be-ribboned bonnets towards their dreams the delta queen is about to set off the great red wheel starts churning and a top-hatted man on deck taps out a reedy version of toot toot tootsie goodbye on the calliope or steam organ sending puffs of smoke out of its shining brass pipes in life on the mississippi mark twain wrote that it was every boy's ambition to be a steamboat man generations of children brought up on his books have fantasised about running away from home and following in huckleberry finn's footsteps along the great brown river for a not entirely modest sum the delta queen steamboat company offers the chance to slip away from modern-day stresses and live out that fantasy on one of its two paddle-wheel steamboats some people prefer the mississippi queen with such modern amenities as cinema and pool but for romantics there is no choice but its elderly relative the delta queen now in its 68 th year of operations the delta queen is the oldest steamboat in the world offering cruises and has been declared a us national historic landmark it is like a floating palace with teak-panelled state-rooms brass fittings and tiffany-style stained glass as a result it is easy to imagine the days when silk-clad ladies sat doing embroidery while the men played poker in the for'ard bar the delta queen runs tours of between three and 12 days through america's heartland wanting to do things properly i opted for one called the old south which promised to recapture the ambience and history of this gracious way of life the scenery on the 682-mile round trip from new orleans to vicksburg on the lower mississippi is disappointing known as the chemical corridor the banks are lined with refineries and petro-chemical plants spewing out yellow smoke and thick oily globules but you do not take a trip like this for the sights nor for the excitement progress is so stately that the boat is often overtaken by cyclists fellow passengers tend to be over 65 and like wearing name tags for those who do not relish playing bingo or dressing up for floozie parades day-time activities consist of reading the daily steamboatin times and flying kites which usually end up tangled in the wheel nights in the bar are spent listening to the quavery crooning of the ever-smiling charlotte champagne or dancing in the orleans room where tireless bob schad is a whizz on the banjo but even the most energetic soon settle into the slow rhythm on-board punctuated by occasional sightseeing stops and frequent large meals of local delicacies such as alligator and catfish the main pastime is river-watching from one of the rocking chairs on deck ts eliot called the mississippi a great brown god and it captivates quickly on waking in the mornings we could see it at its most mysterious swathed in a low mist from which the tops of submerged trees poked through at night under the silvery glow of a full harvest moon it was almost beautiful but it was at its most soulful during the day the delta queen nosing through thick chocolate-brown water which even the us army corps of engineers cannot control as flush with spring rains it changes course and bursts banks to show that it is not to be messed with known as big muddy the mississippi is the longest river in the us draining all or part of 31 states on its winding 2,500 mile journey from the hills of minnesota to the gulf of mexico it is also america's hardest-working waterway carrying 500 m tons of cargo each year in enormous snaking lines of connected barges these as long as five football fields tend to take up the whole river as they round bends there is so much traffic that the delta queen's jovial captain john davitt compares the river to driving on an interstate highway but while motorway drivers may go faster than 7 mph they do not have sandbanks and floating logs to contend with avoiding these obstacles and the barges requires great skill from the river pilots who drive the steamboats and becoming a pilot is not easy the licence is granted in 20-mile segments and those applying have to draw from memory every turn of the river sandbar bridge and buoy in that stretch the delta queen's stops are orchestrated to shield passengers from contact with the 1990 s although it is hard to avoid the tin-roofed slums and proliferation of riverboat casinos to which many of the crew slip off on our first morning we moored at oak alley a greek revival-style antebellum plantation house painted candy pink and reached through a grass alley of 300-year-old oaks so gnarled that the branches touch the floor and meet overhead to make an archway inside the drawing room a painted wooden screen stands in front of the fire it used to prevent beeswax make-up layered on to cover smallpox scars melting into the ladies laps our next stops were st francisville a pretty town under a veil of spanish moss and natchez home to more than half the country's millionaires in the 1850 s louisiana was the centre of the plantation economy and the lower mississippi area is dotted with large colonnaded houses built mostly between the late 18 th century and the civil war to show off the wealth generated by cotton indigo rice and sugar every year during march many of these private mansions are opened to the public to show off opulent and often tasteless interiors plus gardens resplendent with magnolia and dog rose blossoms their lavish settings and names like rosedown or nottoway inspire romantic images of crinolined belles and dashing beaux with waxed moustaches finally we came to vicksburg which is positioned on a steep bluff overlooking the river during the civil war it was a confederate stronghold defending the whole of the lower mississippi in may 1863, general grant's army marched on the town when the confederates refused to surrender he ordered his army to starve them out the bloody siege lasted 47 days now in the immaculately-kept battleground park the old cannons still point at each other while red and blue markers show where the yankee and rebel troops fought each stop we made was marked by a huge puff of steam and a frenzy of calliope-playing locals or camera-toting tourists gathered on shore to wave us off recalling the steamboat a comin days of last century when paddle-wheelers like this used to rule the river the delta queen was built in a glasgow shipyard in the 1920 s for the californian transportation co its owners poured dollars 875,000 into creating a four-tiered balustraded beauty used initially as an overnight dinner cruiser between sacramento and san francisco the depression forced its withdrawal from service until pearl harbour then it was requisitioned by the navy painted grey and used as a troop transporter since then the delta queen has passed through various owners and overhauls it even survived congressional legislation passed to prevent the operation of wooden boats after a tragic fire on a cruise-liner the most spectacular part of the boat is the engine room passengers are welcome to see the pistons driving a 40ft-long pitman arm connected to a crankshaft which turns the 44-ton paddle wheel every so often on steamboats pressure from the boilers gets so high that it has to be relieved through a safety valve the origin of the expression letting off steam after a week being pampered on the delta queen i can think of no better place to do that christina lamb travelled with the delta queen steamboat co of 30
