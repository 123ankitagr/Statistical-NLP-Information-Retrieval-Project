Last Tuesday novelist Chris Moore was waiting tables in a Cambria restaurant . Then word reached him that Disney 's Hollywood Pictures won a bidding war and purchased film rights to Moore 's unpublished novel , `` Practical Demon Keeping , '' a black comedy about a man and his monster , for producer Laurence Marks . A Disney source confirmed that the package , which includes producer Jennifer Levine , went for more than $ 1 million . From Kirk Honeycutt
