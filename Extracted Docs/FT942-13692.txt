Mr Peter Bolliger , managing director of Harrods department store in London's Knightsbridge for two and a half years , has resigned after its owners the Fayeds tried to persuade him to move to head the Kurt Geiger shoe chain . Harrods said Mr Bolliger , 49 , resigned earlier this week 'for personal reasons ' . It confirmed he had been offered the position of managing director of the shoe chain with branches in Harrods , Bond Street and House of Fraser stores . He had turned this down and was now thought to be preparing to return to his native Switzerland . The company would not say why he had been asked to move to Kurt Geiger , other than that his previous experience with Bally , the Swiss shoe company , made him well-suited for the position . There was speculation that the Fayeds , who recently floated off the House of Fraser chain for Pounds 413m , were considering floating Kurt Geiger and asked Mr Bolliger to prepare the company for this . But analysts suggested that a move from running one of the world 's most prestigious department stores to running the shoe chain was effectively a demotion . Mr Bolliger was not available for comment .
