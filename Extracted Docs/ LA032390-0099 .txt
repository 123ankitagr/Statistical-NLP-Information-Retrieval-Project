Sega Wins Joe Montana Endorsement : Video game maker Sega of America signed quarterback Joe Montana -- a self-proclaimed `` video nut '' -- to his largest endorsement deal yet , outbidding industry giant Nintendo with a multimillion-dollar offer . The five-year contract gives Sega the exclusive rights to make and sell home video games , arcade games and computer software using the Super Bowl champion 's likeness . The exact size of the contract was not disclosed , but Montana said it was bigger than any other deal he has signed to date , including his contract with shoemakers L.A. Gear , which was estimated at $ 3 million to $ 5 million , although Montana said those estimates were high . Montana will help Sega , based in South San Francisco , develop football video games in which he will star .
