economic reforms may have brought spectacular material rewards to millions of chinese but growing affluence is also taking its toll on the country's roads china reported 60,000 fatalities last year an increase of 10 per cent on the year before but the actual toll could be much higher perhaps as many as 100,000 road deaths an official of the traffic control department of the ministry of public security said the official figure of 60,000 fatalities had a lot of water in it a chinese expression indicating that the official statistic under-estimated the gravity of the situation the real figure can't be published because it's just too shocking he said the internal estimate was 100,000 last year china's economic boom the economy grew by a staggering 12 per cent in 1992 has brought with it a flood of new vehicles on to the country's already congested roads traffic jams are now the rule rather than the exception in many of china's cities beijing's traffic has become particularly heavy in the past year due in part to a surge of new joint ventures involving foreign participation according to a recent new china news agency despatch china with a population of 1.1 bn had 6 m cars buses and trucks using its roads but this official figure almost certainly understates vehicle numbers china's approach to road safety seems haphazard and limited resources appear to have been devoted to publicity campaigns that may be about to change as the cost to the community of road trauma dawns on the authorities one indication of growing official concern is that two decades after most western countries introduced seat belt regulations china is to follow suit by july new vehicles will be required to fit belts as standard equipment vehicles already on the road will be required to conform or be deemed unroadworthy fines for non-use of seat belts will be five yuan about 60 pence a fairly derisory amount if the chinese are indeed serious about improving road safety according to the spokesman for the public security ministry's traffic department some 70 per cent of road accidents occurred in country areas where ignorance of road safety and traffic rules tended to be greater the official blamed bad driving for most of the accidents the driving standards of chinese motorists are very poor he said they don't care about traffic rules once they get on the road they drive like crazy mr yang jinyao deputy principal of the beijing driver's training school said that in the capital drivers were subjected to a rigorous training schedule but with the rapid increase of numbers of cars on the road it was inevitable the toll would rise he said chinese drivers were certainly not as safety conscious as westerners drink-driving was also a main problem he estimated that about one third of serious accidents involved a drunk driver as more and more chinese take to the roads in motor vehicles forsaking the push-bike that had transported them with relative safety for so many years they are beginning to take out accident insurance but numbers availing themselves of this protection are still small according to a representative of the people's insurance company of china third party insurance is compulsory
