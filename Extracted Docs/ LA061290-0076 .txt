News of Alberto Fujimori 's victory in Peru 's presidential election brought people into the streets to celebrate half a world away in Kawachi , the small Japanese town where his father was born . Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu also welcomed the news . But a Japanese government spokesman ruled out any special economic aid for the hugely indebted South American country just because its new leader is of Japanese descent . `` Our government does not take special measures on the grounds that a Japanese descendant has won ( an election ) , '' Nobuo Ishihara told reporters . There was no such reserve in Kawachi , in the Kumamoto region of southern Japan . `` Hundreds of townspeople gathered at the town hall early in the morning to celebrate Mr. Fujimori 's victory , '' said Shunji Shimazu , mayor of the town that Fujimori 's father , Naoichi , a tailor , left in 1934 to seek his fortune in faraway Peru . `` They broke open a sake barrel and toasted the new president to cries of 'Banzai ! ' The whole township is now obsessed by the news of Fujimori , '' the mayor said . Shimazu said he immediately sent Fujimori a congratulatory message and put up banners at the town hall reading , `` Congratulations , President Alberto Fujimori . '' A Peruvian flag and Japan 's rising sun flew together outside , he added . A street is to be renamed Fujimori Avenue .
