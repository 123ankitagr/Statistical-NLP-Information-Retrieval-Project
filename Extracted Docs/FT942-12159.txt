white is the universal symbol of purity hope new beginnings and in some cultures denotes the spirituality of mourning in spite of its innocent appeal white is wickedly difficult to wear much harder for example than black just a touch of it adds charm or drama the collar of a white shirt for example or chanel's white camellia on a black velvet bow one of this summer's main colours is white the most pure and extreme result of fashion's swing from over-ornate power dressing and heavy black layers shops are already awash with white clothes so we are going to have to make the best of it let us start with the bad points white is a killer for any but the most positive or tanned complexions draining the face of life this is fine for wan catwalk waifs not so good if you want to look normal white summer fabrics inevitably look flimsy even unintentionally transparent the corollary of this is that unless carefully styled white can look cheap and white high-heeled shoes cheaper than anything in spite of karl lagerfeld's efforts to promote them and most important of all white is impractical because it is always in the laundry but white has good points which make it irresistible for summer especially in the airily-layered forms of fashion the spirit which inspired pale colonial linens and still to some extent governs sports clothes makes white the obvious choice on mirage-shimmering bee-humming summer days it seemed natural in our photographic location the south african vineyard of klein constantia at harvest-time where it complemented the white cape dutch buildings and contrasted with the lush dark green trees and vines but try to think further than the now-hackneyed long white colonial dress issey miyake said it all when he put on the catwalk a bunch of gently-whirling dancers showing to best advantage the lightest of crushed silk layers in loose simple shapes the trick is to create the illusion of light passing through gauzy fabric without attracting the ghastly description see-through' you do this by building layers of extremely fine material two layers of even the flimsiest chiffon are a lot more opaque than one the top layer be it a linen gauze shirt or a cobwebby knit is left loose enough to play the trick of the light but you need to build on an unobtrusive base nothing cheapens white so much as the cut line of a bra or slip instead choose a plain flat-strapped crop-top white or flesh-coloured by jockey or knickerbox or a plain sports bra berlei does one that looks like a crop-top with built-in cups which has matching high-cut briefs in white or flesh this shows through like a singlet rather than underwear alternatively marks and spencer's new body shapers range of flat-strapped bras and briefs has four skin tones and is well-nigh invisible as is gossard's glossies bra fabric is another area in which miyake shows the way avoid tailored white choose fabrics that go from washing to wearing in one easy movement this summer's crinkled finishes inspired by miyake's geometrically crushed silk and man-made pleats please range are ideal for packing and ease of care weighty drapy viscose also hangs out well especially as knit these fabrics are also soft enough to flow around the body counteracting white's weight-adding properties and to beat its complexion-deadening ability choose its kinder sister ivory either looks good with a light tan and minimal make-up paler faces need colouring carefully to add life but not overwhelm the fragility of near-white clothes dior's couleurs du temps range gets it right with its desert landscape five-colour palette of warm earth-toned eyeshadows or the pearly rose slate and honey shades of sands and sandstone these are warmed with a slightly pink-toned blusher rose atlas and a pearly natural pink desert pearls or pale pink-beige gobi moon lipstick nina ricci les orchidees two-tone blusher has a slightly tanned sunkissed tone that ties in with their les sepias number 13 lipstick the same subtlety should be applied to accessories new white style needs minimal jewellery perhaps just a smidgeon of silver though tiny pieces in matt gold go better with warmer ivory metallic shoes give a lift to all-over white provided they are plain flat sandals otherwise choose cream or beige suede or fabric shoes or tan sandals for an informal look white had a bad name in the 1980 s for being the natural partner to a mahogany tan bright red lips and jangly gilt jewellery think of a style that is the diametric opposite and you will find white is also right for the 1990 s
