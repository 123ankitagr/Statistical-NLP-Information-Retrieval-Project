Hagerson returns : Lee B. Hagerson returned as head of an Orange County savings and loan when regulators recently approved , as expected , the acquisition of Universal Savings Bank in Orange by Taiwanese businessman J.S . Chang . `` It 's nice to be back in Orange County , '' Hagerson said after his first two weeks on the job . `` I have a lot of good friends , and it 's just a nice place to be . '' Hagerson , who has 30 years of experience in commercial banking and thrift industries , had been an industry consultant in Orange County and was president of Westmark Savings Bank in Newport Beach when it was sold three years ago and moved to Sherman Oaks . Hagerson does n't have a lot to say yet about the direction Universal will take . `` I 've got a lot to do . I 've got a mountain to climb , '' he said . `` The big thing is getting a handle on things , then we 'll decide what we 're going to do . '' He knows , though , that new owner J.S . Chang , a Taiwanese shoe tycoon , has sufficient funds to help the S & L grow . Universal , a healthy thrift with eight branches , was sold to Chang for more than $ 13 million by Unity Corp. Ltd. of Sydney , which is run by Australian magnate Garry Carter . He has been peddling the thrift ever since regulators seized his institution three years ago , alleging that it was about to ship $ 10 million in loans to him illegally . A state court threw the regulators out and returned the thrift to Unity .
