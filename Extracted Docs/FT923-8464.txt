a state retirement age of 65 for both men and women could be twice as expensive for the government as harmonising the age at 60, according to the trades union congress in a response to last week's recommendation by the social security advisory committee of a pension age of 65, the tuc also says that equalising the age at 60 is the most socially progressive option and takes account of social trends and people's wishes the advisory committee had agreed with the government that raising the retirement age of women from 60 to 65, the same as for men would save roughly pounds 3 bn a year in additional expenditure however in a letter to mr peter lilley social security secretary the tuc says that independent calculations produced for it show that the choice of 65 might cost pounds 1.4 bn the cost of equalising the age at 60 might be pounds 700 m to arrive at the pounds 700 m cost the tuc has assumed that economic activity rates for men aged between 60 and 65 will eventually fall to 30 per cent from the present 53 per cent in arriving at the pounds 1.4 bn figure the tuc assumes the proportion of women retiring after 60 would increase to about the same as for men it also assumes that about half of the jobs filled by women who postpone retirement would have been available to job seekers mr norman willis tuc general secretary said on this basis an increase in the state pension age for women actually increases the net cost to the economy as a whole letters page 13
