tourism assets and attractions for some years as with other old manufacturing cities like glasgow it has realised tourism can become an important services sector a good revenueearner and a large employer manchester is well endowed with restaurants the city claims it is possible to eat in a restaurant offering different national cuisine every evening for a month every taste and style is catered for mexican indonesian armenian korean japanese turkish nepalese persian indian chinese greek french and italian chinese cooking is dominant because manchester has an extensive chinatown which is colourful and bustles at night the area has 60 restaurants as an indicator of quality the city has 14 restaurants listed on the good food guide a leading uk restaurant monitor there are victorian public houses numerous wine bars and some famous breweries for entertainment manchester has more theatres than any other regional centre and more than any uk city outside london there are five

commercially successful theatres outside london are principal destinations for touring opera ballet and theatre companies for 1994 manchester has been designated the uks city of drama which will mean

incunabula and rare first editions in sport greater manchester has eight football league clubs one of which manchester united recently won the premier league rugby league is also popular in the region with salford and wigan among the most successful clubs old trafford is the home of the lancashire cricket club to these attractions manchester has added in recent years two specific tourism products visitors to granada studios tours enjoy guided tours of film and tv sets and walk along the coronation street set opposite the studios is granadas victoria and albert hotel a television themed hotel around 750000 people visit the studios annually the museum of science and industry is like granadas studios in castlefield an old part of manchester which went into decline but is now being restored in all greater manchester attracts 35m staying visitors a year of which more than 40 per cent are overseas visitors these visitors spend around pounds 238m a year there are 6m day visitors who spend pounds 41m on the main attractions in greater manchester there are more than 200000 hotel beds in more than 300 hotels greater manchester is well placed for first class hotels there are 20 hotels of international standard in the city including the midland one of holiday inns crowne plaza brand the portland thistle and the ramada renaissance hotel there is a another group around the airport including a hilton forte crest and a four seasons the key question is how would a successful olympics bid affect the tourism infrastructure could it cope are there enough hotel rooms for the influx of visitors an impact study undertaken by kpmg management consulting estimates that over the 17 days of the olympics there could be 565m visits the total spend generated by the olympics would be about pounds 250m the point to be made here is that it is not just manchester that is bidding for the games but the northwest region as a whole some of the events will be taking place in liverpool others in north wales ms elizabeth jeffries chief executive of the greater manchester visitor and convention bureau says there would be no problem at all with hotel rooms manchester is surrounded by country house hotels and there is liverpool and blackpool not to mention leeds these places are all on the rail network the fact that it is a regional bid within a national bid should enhance its prospects mr john glester a member of the bid committee and chief executive of the central manchester development corporation says that while manchester itself might be unglamourous britain as a whole is not some of the most attractive parts of the country are in the northwest the peak national park the yorkshire dales the lake district are all within two hours drive of manchester on good roads ms jeffries is hoping that win or lose the publicity surrounding the bid will help increase the number of tourists she says we have a target to uplift business visitors by 5 per cent a year for the next three years and to increase staying visitors to the region by 10 per cent a year we have done well but we still have a number of hidden assets that we should use
