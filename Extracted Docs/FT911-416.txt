Sir , Mr Douglas Dale ( Letters , May 8 ) suggests short term penal capital gains tax will encourage long term investment . Many companies have found the best long term shareholders are private individuals . May I suggest a better answer would be to encourage the private investor by equalising the tax treatment on direct and indirect investment . If capitalism is to work we must have a tax system that penalises us if we delegate our responsibilities to institutions not prepared to accept them .
