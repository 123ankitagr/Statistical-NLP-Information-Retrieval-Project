use of the internet an global network of computer networks is expanding rapidly as individual personal computer users and companies recognise its value for communications research and marketing the internet is the most expansive network of computer networks in the world linking an estimated 2.2 m computers and over 25 m users in 137 countries use of the internet is growing at a rate of about ten per cent per month the net as it is commonly called is an outgrowth of a us government funded research program that began in the late 1960 s to electronically link researchers at us universities and government laboratories throughout the 1980 s the internet grew in popularity among computer hobbyists it provides cheap electronic mail conferencing and network searching capabilities for personal computer junkies virtual communities with common interests are linked on the internet exchanging messages from all over the world one of the internet's attractions is that it allows users to explore computer data bases all over the world it is possible for example to pour through the catalogue of the library of congress access information about nasa space shots or log on to computers in australia all for the cost of a local phone call plus whatever connect charges are imposed by the access provider the growing popularity of the internet has spawned dozens of these access providers companies and organisations that provide individual and corporate computer users with dial up links to the internet some such as the web in northern california encourage social interaction on-line and off among their users this gives them a distinct net culture reflecting the views and interests of their subscribers others act simply as a connection service much like a phone company provides links to its voice network until very recently however use of the internet has been limited to those with a relatively high level of computer expertise most computers on the internet run the unix operating system which is unfamiliar to the majority of pc users the internet therefore lacked the user friendly features such as graphical user interfaces that have made pcs increasingly easy to use now several interface programs are making the net more accessible to computer novices in particular a program called mosaic developed by the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa at the university of illinois at urbana-champaign is gaining popularity as an easy to use point and click interface for searching portions of the internet millions of new internet users are also beginning to gain access to the worldwide network via commercial on-line information services such as compuserve and america online business use of the internet is also on the rise with thousands of companies hooking their internal networks on to the net in the us the number of business host computers directly linked to the internet increased 63 per cent to 567,686 over the 12 months ending in january almost equaling the number of internet links to us colleges and universities each host computer can support numerous individual personal computer users use of the internet in the uk jumped 94 per cent over the same period with 113,930 host computers hooked up by the end of january much of the uk growth is also believed to come from the commercial sector companies are rushing to take advantage of the internet as a low-cost route for international electronic mail digital equipment the us computer company is one of the heaviest users of the internet with over 31,000 computers linked to the system the company exchanges an average of 1.7 m e-mail messages with people outside the company per month the open nature of the internet with its millions of users and the lack of any central control has however created security problems corporate users of the internet therefore typically try to isolate their internal computer networks from the internet to avoid intrusions from curious or malevolent computer hackers security has become a barrier to the commercial growth of the internet many clients want to connect but won't do it because of the security problems says jim hogan vice president of global communication and information processing services at digital equipment the company has at least one or two computer break-in attempts per week he acknowledges over the past ten years we've developed methods of securing our own network that as far as we know have never been penetrated digital recently announced an internet security service based on the technology and expertise that it has developed to protect its own networks digital's system incorporates two gateways one that is linked to the internet and a second that is hidden from the outside world in effect the system builds firewalls around internal networks protecting them from unwanted intruders encryption and user authentication systems could bring greater security to the internet experts say however the introduction of such systems is not welcomed by many internet enthusiasts who fear that they will detract from the open communications that have long been a central facet of net culture o'reilly and associates a us publishing group has created the global network navigator a free internet-based information center that includes news an online magazine an interactive catalogue and a global marketplace containing advertiser-sponsored information on a wide range of products and services in california's silicon valley a consortium of companies and organisations is establishing commercenet an electronic marketplace for high technology companies mecklermedia a us technology publishing group recently launched mecklerweb an electronic communications and marketing system aimed at companies that want to have a corporate presence on the internet such business uses of the internet will secure its future as a critical part of the information superhighway drawing resources to the development of new software for use on the internet and encouraging its expansion the internet of the future is however likely to be very different from the research oriented network that its creators originally envisaged and from the computer hobbyists playground that the internet has been for the past decade
