A Los Angeles federal judge rejected electronic monitoring of John Anthony Jackson on Friday and once again denied bail for the former Drug Enforcement Administration agent . `` I 'm just not of a mind to experiment with this monitoring , '' said U.S. District Judge Terry J. Hatter Jr. `` You ( Jackson ) will remain detained . '' Jackson 's lawyer , John Robertson , proposed that his 39-year-old client wear a monitoring bracelet , which would broadcast 24 hours a day . If the signal was interrupted , Robertson said , a private monitoring service would notify authorities . Hatter refused to release Jackson last week , declaring that he was not satisfied that Jackson could buy an expensive home and several businesses on the $ 30,000 or $ 40,000 yearly salary of a DEA agent . Jackson and two other former drug agency agents , Darnell Garcia , 41 , and Wayne Countryman , 45 , were indicted by a federal grand jury in December on charges of conspiring to evade Internal Revenue Services taxes by laundering more than $ 600,000 through foreign banks . Garcia is still a fugitive . Countryman was freed on $ 120,000 bail .
