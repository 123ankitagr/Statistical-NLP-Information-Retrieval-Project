GENERAL Augusto Pinochet , commander-in-chief of the Chilean army , was expected to depart on a tour today to visit arms makers in Europe , Israel and South Africa . Defence Minister Patricio Rojas said Gen Pinochet had been granted leave of absence until June 5 'to visit foreign defence companies that supply the Chilean army ' , but he did not disclose details of the general 's itinerary . Unofficially , it is believed Chile 's former dictator will visit France , Switzerland and possibly Britain , as well as Israel and South Africa . The Chilean government is trying to keep the controversial tour as low-key as possible . Gen Pinochet 's last European visit was in 1975 , to attend Gen Franco 's funeral in Spain . Most democratic governments then regarded him as a pariah ; he received only a handful of invitations from fellow Latin American strongmen during his 16-year rule , which ended in March 1990 . Gen Pinochet , accustomed to blaming his vile reputation abroad on 'Communist propaganda ' , has been taken aback by the hostility which greeted his announced visit to the UK .
