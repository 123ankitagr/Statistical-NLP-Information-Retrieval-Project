The United Artists movie studio , maker of Oscar-winning `` Rain Man , '' will be sold to an Australian entertainment company for $ 1 billion under an agreement announced late Friday . The deal would give Qintex Group , one of the makers of the recent CBS miniseries `` Lonesome Dove , '' most of the assets of MGM-UA Communications Co. , including rights to `` Rain Man . '' Also included would be a library of 4,000 movies , among them the `` James Bond '' and `` Pink Panther '' series , the video library and movie and television production and distribution facilities . MGM-UA 's majority shareholder , Kirk Kerkorian , would retain control of the MGM name and TV and movie studios , as well as 34 MGM movies , including `` Moonstruck '' and `` A Fish Called Wanda . '' The agreement between Qintex and Kirk Kerkorian is subject to unspecified government , shareholder and `` third-party '' approvals , according to a joint announcement by the two companies . MGM-UA officials refused to elaborate on a news release , which said the deal was expected to be complete in late summer . How Deal Would Work It is the second time this year Kerkorian has agreed to sell part of the company he assembled out of the former United Artists and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios . In addition to a collapsed deal to sell an interest in the MGM name to fellow Hollywood investor Burt Sugarman in July , Kerkorian has been publicly shopping all or part of MGM-UA for months . Kerkorian , who owns 82 % of MGM-UA through his Tracinda Corp. , pumped $ 180 million of his own funds into the money-losing company in January . MGM-UA lost $ 39.5 million in the first quarter of 1989 and $ 48.7 million in 1988 . Under the complicated agreement with Qintex , Kerkorian will hang onto rights to the MGM name and roaring lion logo as well as movie and TV production units . Also remaining with MGM are 34 movies made since June 1986 , including `` Moonstruck , '' `` A Fish Called Wanda , '' and `` Willow ; '' 1,750 hours of TV programming including the ongoing shows `` thirtysomething '' and `` In the Heat of the Night ; '' and the MGM headquarters building here . The deal is to work this way : Kerkorian sells 100 % of MGM-UA to Qintex for $ 20 a share , or about $ 1 billion . Then the company is split , and Kerkorian buys back what will be the new MGM -- the MGM movie and TV studios plus the 34 movies in the MGM film and video libraries -- for $ 250 million . Further intertwining the now independent MGM and UA , Kerkorian is to invest $ 75 million in Qintex , and the companies sign various distribution agreements .
