investors are likely to return from today's public holiday to be confronted with the figures for german m3 money supply growth in april due early this week the data could unsettle the market expectations had been that the annualised seasonally adjusted rate of growth would sink to 13 per cent in april after 15.4 per cent in the previous month but an article in last friday's frankfurter allgemeine newspaper suggested that the figure may prove to be above the march outcome if this proves to be the case the bundesbank's chances of hitting its 4 to 6 per cent target for monetary growth for the year as a whole will recede still further and the bundesbank's new policy introduced this month with the half percentage point cut in the discount and lombard rates of using interest rate cuts to reduce m3 growth will look more of a gamble than ever although of course these cuts were too late to influence the april data if the m3 data dampens investors enthusiasm for bunds this may be revived by a good inflation figure for may due to be announced at the end of the week the figure could be down to an annual rate of below 3 per cent at last coupled with a strong d-mark this could revive hopes of further rate cuts
