Suzie Azar became the first woman mayor in El Paso history with a landslide victory over fellow City Council member Ed Elsey in a runoff election . `` One hundred seventeen years is a long time for El Paso to wait , and I 'm glad they waited for me , '' Azar said . The final but unofficial totals showed she had captured 65 % of the votes , or 29,961 , to 35 % , or 16,218 , for Elsey . The successor to Mayor Jonathan Rogers , who by law had to step down after four consecutive two-year terms , will face problems posed by widespread poverty and rapid growth . El Paso 's elections are nonpartisan .
