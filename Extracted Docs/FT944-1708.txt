Sir , Would you buy an advertising campaign for your company from an advertising company which did not understand the value of a company name ( 'Saatchi chairman forced to quit by US shareholders ' , December 17 ) ? In 20 years Saatchi has built an enviable worldwide profile attractive to both clients and investors . Anonymity would seem a rather perverse corporate move , but very attractive to the competition .
