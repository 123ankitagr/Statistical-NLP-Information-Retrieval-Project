or western europe at any rate coming to in the good old days when the jobs column first started printing international pay comparisons one thing could be counted on in any ranking of nations east of the atlantic swiss executives would strut yodelling on the summit these days nothing can be found in its proper place any more as witness the table to the right published as on previous occasions thanks to the wyatt consultancy group it shows europe's top 12 executive-paying countries taken alone the fact that the swiss have had the skids put under them wouldn't be upsetting after all they were knocked off the top the whole of two years ago but now the nation that displaced them the spanish have also been sent tumbling by the germans indeed the changes are such that i've subjected them to some extra-curricular reckoning but before turning to that i'll tell what the table does as it stands the figures in it as distinct from the ranking itself come from the surveys made by wyatt's data services arm in brussels the latest study covers 1,569 companies of assorted sizes and types in 17 countries and gives a wealth of data far beyond the few bits printed here any reader who wants the full report can obtain it at a price through don mcclune at wyatt's london office 21 tothill st london sw1h 9 ll telephone 0 71-222 8033, fax 0 71-222 9182 my extracts relate only to three sorts of managers chief executives together with directors in charge of finance and administration and of personnel the figures cover holders of those posts across all companies surveyed in each land making no adjustment for size or kind of business the other currencies have been converted into sterling at the london closing exchange rates of may 7 in each category the table gives basic salary total money rewards including bonuses and a rough gauge of buying power the three columns headed lower quartile refer to the executive who'd be a quarter of the way up from the foot of a ranking of all in the same job and country the median trio to the executive ranked mid-way and the upper quartile set to the one a quarter way down from the top finally come the standard averages each country's place in the table being determined by the chief executives average buying power computed from wyatt's indices of living-cost variances the trouble is that all such indices not only differ from one another but are anyway no more than a loosely approximate guide for instance none that i know of includes housing costs in the basket of goods and services on which it is based so to give another slant on the issue i've reworked the chiefs average buying-power using a different set of indices compiled by p-e international here's the alternative ranking that results country wyatt p-e b power index index p-e
