to drug enforcement officers they are known as swallowers or mules and in recent years nigerians who ingest condoms and balloons filled with heroin and cocaine have emerged as the worlds leading drug traffickers british officials say more nigerians were arrested in the last three years trying to smuggle narcotics into the uk than any other nationals and in the us customs agents estimate that sophisticated nigerian drug rings account for more than 40 per cent of heroin seizures at us ports of entry the multimillion dollar illicit trade in drugs is tightly controlled by nigerians who use lagos as a transit station and exploit the countrys loose banking system porous borders and a police and customs force notorious for corruption hundreds of kilogrammes of asian heroin mostly from india thailand and the golden triangle and cocaine from south america pass through lagos for storage and repackaging before onward shipment to the us and europe nigeria has also become the second largest world supplier of cannabis after ghana exporting 5940lb last year last year us customs agents seized 526lb of white heroin with a street value of dollars 239m from nigerian controlled smuggling operations in the first five months of 1992 seizures had increased to 361lb officials say it is impossible to know what percentage of drugs smuggled into europe and the us are seized but estimates vary from 5 to 40 per cent for customs officers the difficulty with the nigerian drug rings stem from the large quantity of swallowers that are used and the increasing sophistication of the cartels the greatest problem according to one drug enforcement officer is that western prison sentences offer no deterrent to potential smugglers five years in a western prison with three meals a day television the chance to get an education and earn some pocket money is no deterrent to a nigerian making dollars 30 a month who is suddenly offered dollars 5000 to make a drug run the official said the nigerian connection in the international drugs trade first surfaced around 198485 and has grown as the economy of the once rich oil producer has plummeted nigerians have seen one of the fastest declines in living standards with gross domestic product per capita falling from dollars 1000 in 1980 to dollars 370 in 1986 nigerian drug barons have also flourished in a country where it is easy to launder drug money through the freewheeling banking sector and where the recently established national drug law enforcement agency is inadequately funded western drug officials also say that widespread corruption in the police force customs service and even in the judiciary and the absence of tough conspiracy laws has protected nigerians from being arrested and brought to trial earlier this year mr frank odita nigerias police commissioner said that 13 judges and a policeman had been implicated in the illegal release of 120 suspects awaiting trial on trafficking charges many were freed using forged bail bonds and release orders the ndlea itself has also faced accusations that some of its agents are being paid off by the drug rings last year the agencys arrest rate fell sharply and so far it has yet to achieve a big conviction mr adeogba admits that not everybody in the agency is a saint but says that the critical problem facing the agency has been insufficient support for training funding and sharing of nigerian controlled drug assets seized overseas he says last year 72 per cent of the dollars 1bn of drug related assets seized by the us drug enforcement agency were controlled by nigerians and that some of these funds should be given to nigeria to help fight the drug war western donors however say that until the agency cleans up its record and spends the money it does receive more efficiently it is difficult to justify further funding
