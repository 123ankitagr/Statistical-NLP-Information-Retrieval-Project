UC San Diego researchers report that they can alleviate the symptoms of Parkinson 's disease in rats by grafting genetically engineered skin cells into the animals ' brains . Their technique may drastically reduce some of the ethical difficulties associated with a controversial new therapy for the disease that involves grafting brain cells from aborted fetuses into the brains of Parkinson 's victims . Parkinson 's is caused by the death of brain cells that secrete the neurotransmitter dopamine , which plays a key role in the control of muscle movements . In an effort to replace the lost dopamine , surgeons have grafted both tissue from the adrenal glands , which also secrete dopamine , and brain tissue from aborted fetuses into the brains of about 300 Parkinson 's victims . But grafting adrenal tissue requires two operations -- one to remove the tissue from its normal location over the kidney and one to implant it -- and the use of fetal tissue has become inextricably entwined with the debate over abortion . Federal rules now prevent the use of fetal tissue in government-funded research or therapy . Neuroscientist Fred H. Gage and his colleagues at UCSD have circumvented these problems by genetically altering rat skin cells so that they secrete dopamine , then implanting the cells into the brains of rats in which dopamine-secreting brain cells had been destroyed . Because the cells were destroyed on only one side of the brain , the rats ' muscle control was impaired on one side of their body and they walked in circles . Gage and his colleagues reported in the latest Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that the genetically engineered cells reduced the Parkinson-like symptoms by 40 % . The altered cells are `` nowhere near as effective as fetal cells , '' Gage said , but he believes that their efficacy can be greatly improved . Most important , he added , the approach offers a `` viable alternative '' to the use of fetal cells .
