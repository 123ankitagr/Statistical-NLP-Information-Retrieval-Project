once again there is a scandal brewing in mayor bradley's neighborhood what will the good mayor do this time will there be another person who has to resign his position because he was unduly influenced by the good mayor and should have known better will there be another new ethics law introduced for the city by the good mayor will he show us that politics is really a sleazy profession and ask for the public's understanding the truth is that bradley can ask for anything but my vote that is one thing that he will never get again harvey j glass sherman oaks
