Tiny amounts of cocaine , smaller than those commonly given by doctors for anesthesia , can trigger a significant reduction in the flow of blood to the heart , a study shows . Young , seemingly healthy cocaine abusers sometimes suffer chest pain or heart attacks , even though their heart arteries appear normal . Doctors have speculated that the drug causes spasms in blood vessels and temporarily chokes off the flow of blood to heart muscles . `` The importance of our findings was showing that this indeed happens , '' said Dr. L. David Hillis . The study , conducted by Hillis and his colleagues at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas , was published in last week 's New England Journal of Medicine . In their experiment on 45 people , doctors tested cocaine 's effects on the heart when volunteers received doses that were about two-thirds the amount used for anesthesia . By contrast , people who abuse cocaine typically take six times this much . `` Even that small dose caused coronary blood flow to fall by about 15 to 20 % , '' Hillis said . Hillis said that despite the finding , the medical use of cocaine as a anesthetic is safe . The volunteers showed no sign in their hearts of ischemia , or oxygen starvation .
