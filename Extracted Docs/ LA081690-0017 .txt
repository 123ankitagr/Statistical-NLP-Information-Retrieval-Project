fourteen years after the breakup of return to forever guitarist al dimeola still misses being a member of the seminal electric jazz band led by chick corea dimeola in fact still harbors hopes of a reunion with former band mates corea the piano and keyboard player drummer lenny white and bassist stanley clarke it was the most ridiculous thing for chick to ever break up the group said dimeola who plays the bacchanal at 830 monday i have expressed this to chick and i know stanley and lenny feel strongly too ive met with chick and stanleys met with him weve tried to talk sense into him but i think we have a scientology problem to deal with possibly due to stanley leaving scientology that doesnt sit very well with chick corea is an acknowledged devotee of the selfimprovement movement founded by the late l ron hubbard when clarke gave up scientology corea broke up the group after the romantic warrior album we had signed a multimilliondollar deal with cbs but chick decided to go in a different direction dimeola said his disappointment is understandable he hasnt recorded on his own since the 1987 album tirami su its very strange ive talked to labels like grp and i havent gotten a response at all which is bizarre all i can tell you is that the majority of what ive heard coming from that label is extremely boring i have a demo worth of material which is as strong or stronger than anything ive ever done and ive sold close to 5 million records im right up there with some of the bestselling jazz artists around worldwide dimeola is playing san diego with his world sinfonia a quartet also including classical guitarist chris carrington and percussionists arto tuncboyaci and gumbi ortiz i heard chris 10 years ago at a club in dallas and i always had it in mind to do something with him the magic in this particular group is the spontaneity we leave lots of room for improvisation and we have a real good rapport especially with the percussionists the songs are mostly dimeolas but the group also tackles dimeolas arrangements of other pieces in november dimeola plans to hit the road with a new electric band the group will hone material for an album he hopes to record by years end the flip side of dimeola is guitarist larry carlton who has a sevenalbum deal with grp carltons career spans more than 20 years of solo projects and prodigious studio work with quincy jones michael jackson john lennon jerry garcia neil diamond dolly parton and linda ronstadt mostly during the early 70s and of course there was his tenure with the crusaders the funky jazz band from 1971 to 1977 carltons album collection released this year is a compilation of 20 years of his music including such signature tunes as nite crawler and minute by minute he said he plans to play many of his lightjazz radio hits in san diego next wednesday night during shows at 6 and 830 guitar virtuoso stanley jordan whose patented tapping technique wows listeners will share the bill by tapping the strings with the fingers of both hands an effect which almost makes the guitar a keyboard instrument jordan gets a symphonic sound which seems impossible from a single human being the concert will be a homecoming for san diego saxophonist hollis gentry who left his local band neon to join carltons band last year flutists have seldom made it big as leaders but dave valentin seems a rare exception to the rule if you look back historically at flute players youll find eric dolphy james moody yusef lateef hubert laws and herbie mann not necessarily in that order many like moody and dolphy doubled on saxophones but i think herbie mann was able to make the flute a legitimate lead instrument naturally im an aggressive player but i would like to show the public that the flute has a whole texture of colors and sounds valentin and his group stop at elarios monday and tuesday nights for shows at 830 and 1030 as part of a west coast tour after all this talk about grp its worth noting that valentin was the first artist signed to the label 11 years ago last week marked the start of the us grant hotels push to become a hot social spot for downtowners the effort includes
