the polished brass and studio lighting of finer shoe stores instead patrons are greeted by the smell of cement glue and the sound of workers hammering away on leather soles cardboard boxes scraps of leather and unfinished shoes fill every corner of the store yet people from as far away as hollywood and san diego make pilgrimages to the no-frills shoe store because here they can order custom shoes in any size or style when people from hollywood make a movie and need a 16th-century-style shoe i design it says john tran owner of gia shoe design if someone wants a blue suede shoe in size triple e

with a fashion flair up until a few years ago women with wide feet had to wear old lady shoes wide shoes were very conservative-looking says hugh salomon of pasadena owner of the store salomon used to operate a family shoe store which his own wife couldn't shop at because the store didn't stock wider shoes when he opened his first shoe store in pasadena six years ago he had to persuade shoe manufacturers to make their current styles in wider sizes apparently no one went to the manufacturers and told them of the need he says now he has 25 to 30 manufacturers supplying him with wide shoes

gia shoe design from a shelf above his desk tran pulls down what looks like an ordinary shoe box lifts the lid and reveals its strange contents inside there's an impression of two feet in a styrofoam mold with one foot slightly larger and wider than the other tran will use the impression to design a pair of shoes according to the feet's dimensions this way the shoe fits exactly the way the customer wants it to he says some shoes have cork inserts built inside or one heel that's higher than the other for customers with foot problems i also make shoes for very tiny feet these are a size 2, tran says holding up a small pair of women's pumps customers can bring in a picture of a shoe from a magazine and tran will draw up a pattern for it some bring a swatch of material and order shoes cut from red velvet or pink brocade if they have a fancy dress we can build a shoe to match says tran as he cuts out a shoe pattern from a piece of caramel-colored leather his ankle boots with their pointed toes and crocodile trim have proved popular with teen-agers and rock singers one singer had tran design a pair of lace-up black patent leather boots he charges about 100 to 300 for a pair of custom shoes and about 300 to 400 for corrective shoes tran keeps patterns and sketches of shoes he has designed in an overstuffed binder in a back room workers sew together pieces of leather that have been cut from tran's pattern the so-called leather upper is then stretched over a mold shaped like a shoe one worker glues the heel to the sole then the sole is attached to the leather upper
