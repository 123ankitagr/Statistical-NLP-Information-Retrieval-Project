THE FIRST formal Taiwanese delegation to visit the Chinese mainland in four decades has arrived in Peking following Taiwan 's National Assembly vote on April 22 to end 43 years of emergency rule and abrogate wartime provisions enacted in 1948 to deal with the 'suppression of the communist rebellion ' . The 14-member Taiwanese delegation , representing the recently formed Taipei Straits Exchange Foundation , yesterday met officials from the Office of Taiwan Affairs under China 's State Council . China has responded to the vote by Taiwanese MPs by ending propaganda broadcasts by the People 's Liberation Army to Taiwanese troops stationed on the islands lying between Taiwan and China 's Fujian province . The way is now open for talks between Taiwan and China on direct trade and , perhaps , on reunification . Bilateral trade has expanded rapidly but until now it is officially supposed to have been routed through Hong Kong . Tang Shubei , deputy director of China 's Taiwan Affairs Office , told the visitors that China adhered to the one-China principle that Taiwan was an inalienable part of China 's territory .
