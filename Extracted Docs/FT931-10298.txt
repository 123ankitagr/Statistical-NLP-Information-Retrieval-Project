so you think buying a railway ticket will get more complicated after british rail's privatisation you should try buying one today from london to gatwick airport as things stand you can choose between two types of train for the journey intercity's non-stop gatwick express taking 30 minutes or a network southeast suburban train taking four minutes longer british rail charges exactly the same fare whichever train you choose pounds 8.60 for the one-way journey so everyone takes the gatwick express but wait pounds 8.60 is much more than you would normally expect to pay for a 27-mile trip on network southeast and indeed on examining the fare table you find that the fare from london to three bridges the next station down the line is only pounds 6.70 in other words british rail is artificially bumping up the network southeast fare to gatwick to protect its intercity revenues the thrifty solution would clearly be to take a pounds 6.70 ride on the network southeast train to three bridges and get off a station early thus saving pounds 1.90 br says this is unlawful so you would get into trouble if a ticket inspector caught you however the determined cheapskate can legitimately save 70 p by taking a pounds 6.70 trip to three bridges and booking another ticket there for the pounds 1.20 trip back up the line to gatwick all this of course will change with privatisation in all probability the network southeast service and gatwick express will be operated by competing franchisees so this nonsense about fixing the fares will cease and budget-conscious travellers will swarm to the cheaper service a pity really considering the gatwick express is just about br's only profitable passenger service clearly a case of caveat emptor
