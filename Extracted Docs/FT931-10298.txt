so you think buying a railway ticket will get more complicated after british rails privatisation you should try buying one today from london to gatwick airport as things stand you can choose between two types of train for the journey intercitys nonstop gatwick express taking 30 minutes or a network southeast suburban train taking four minutes longer british rail charges exactly the same fare whichever train you choose pounds 860 for the oneway journey so everyone takes the gatwick express but wait pounds 860 is much more than you would normally expect to pay for a 27mile trip on network southeast and indeed on examining the fare table you find that the fare from london to three bridges the next station down the line is only pounds 670 in other words british rail is artificially bumping up the network southeast fare to gatwick to protect its intercity revenues the thrifty solution would clearly be to take a pounds 670 ride on the network southeast train to three bridges and get off a station early thus saving pounds 190 br says this is unlawful so you would get into trouble if a ticket inspector caught you however the determined cheapskate can legitimately save 70p by taking a pounds 670 trip to three bridges and booking another ticket there for the pounds 120 trip back up the line to gatwick all this of course will change with privatisation in all probability the network southeast service and gatwick express will be operated by competing franchisees so this nonsense about fixing the fares will cease and budgetconscious travellers will swarm to the cheaper service a pity really considering the gatwick express is just about brs only profitable passenger service clearly a case of caveat emptor
