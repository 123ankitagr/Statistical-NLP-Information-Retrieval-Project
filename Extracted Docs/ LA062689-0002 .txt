says incidents investigation navy officials left many questions unanswered two recent accidents southern california coast involving houston fastattack submarine but evidence emerged least one incidents occurred houston blind spot similar one described submarine experts interviewed last week strange may seem civilians submarine experts say highly sophisticated navy submarines sometimes travel oceans world nearly blind around in fact maneuvers submarine captain operates blind spot unlike driver changing lanes freeway under navy policy submarines rarely use sensitive active sonar systems board order must emit signals could reveal location instead rely passive sonar means carefully listening sound engines clanking chains auditory clues no noise no detection but vessel making noise little chance submariners detect its quite extraordinary said angus peetz research aide george foulkes member british parliament pressed fullscale investigation similar sub incidents british isles they hit targets 2000 miles away cant spot fishing boat while issue sub collisions something relatively new california mariners growing controversy britain ireland members british irish parliaments demanding know role submarines may played mysterious disappearances sinkings snaggings several dozen fishing boats irish sea resulting loss 100 lives since 1980 officials us british navies said submarines involved fatal incidents area however officials navies confirmed details collisions several snaggings involving submarines civilian vessels the collisions naval experts say illustrate point remains true today surfacing deep maneuver challenges even experienced skippers highesttech gadgets board most vulnerable time its time submarine vulnerable said hannifin commander us nato submarines mediterranean 1971 1973 went become director joint chiefs staff hes really blind the problem submarine completely submerged cant see anything it hear cant see it hear fishing boat example fishing boat running engines what cant hear fishing nets barges towed barges dont make noise in order minimize chances running another vessel submarines generally travel well surface when time ascend move swiftly periscope depth there period truly uncertainty go transition deep submerged state shallow submerged state carefully search around said capt thomas c maloney retired commanding officer nuclearpowered submarine class houston you maneuver ship see theres target behind maloney said quickly try bring ship look periscope maloney described transition period tensionfilled time compared automobile freeway once get ready change lanes sudden find theres somebody blind spot maloney said even though thought youve done pretty careful search masked sounds such events occur rarely maloney said explanations vary sometimes another loud ship distance masks sound closer ship said or sometimes simply sailboat making detectable noise still active sonar capable detecting silent objects rarely used using passive sonar submarine crew member simply listens noises active sonar operator send sound waves bounce back submarine ping strikes object the active system works best detecting totally submerged objects maloney said less reliable aimed surface depth water conditions surface waves variables generate sonar clutter cuts reliability said the overriding reason active sonar rarely used however security when use active sonar give position away said james bush retired navy captain former submarine commander works washingtonbased center defense information active sonar generally reserved battle situations bush said youre going shoot torpedo anyway make sure know exactly in case bush others said highly unlikely sonar system would detect fishing net navy officials confirm
