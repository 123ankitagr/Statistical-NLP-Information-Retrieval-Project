carefully deliberately and by the book the crewmen maneuvered the us navy submarine up from the depths of the mediterranean sea they listened to the sonar for telltale noises nothing the order was given to climb as the periscope poked above the surface the looming image of a 100000ton tanker came into focus dead ahead he was so big that even headon bowon we couldnt hear his screws propellers through his hull so we didnt know he was there recalled retired vice admiral patrick j hannifin we came up and went down in a hurry hannifins submarine escaped harms way during the nearcollision which occurred more than a decade ago in the mediterranean sea two weeks ago off the coast of los angeles the crew of the submarine houston was not so fortunate the crew of the tugboat barcona was less fortunate still the nuclearpowered houston on standby for filming of the motion picture the hunt for red october a fictional saga of a soviet submarine skippers defection to the united states snagged the barconas steel tow cable and yanked the tugboat backward and under in less than a minute one crew member drowned and two others survived a navy spokeswoman at the houstons home port in san diego called the incident freakish but the submarine only two days later operating in roughly the same waters sliced through a trawlers fishing net the navy says both incidents are under investigation navy officials have left many questions unanswered in the two recent accidents off the southern california coast involving the houston a fastattack submarine but evidence has emerged that at least one of the incidents occurred while the houston was in a blind spot similar to the one described by submarine experts interviewed last week strange as it may seem to civilians submarine experts say that highly sophisticated navy submarines sometimes travel through the oceans of the world nearly blind to what is around them in fact during some maneuvers the submarine captain operates with a blind spot not unlike a driver changing lanes on a freeway under navy policy submarines rarely use the sensitive active sonar systems on board because in order to do so they must emit signals that could reveal their location instead they rely on passive sonar which means carefully listening for the sound of engines clanking chains or any other auditory clues no noise no detection but if a vessel is not making any noise there is little chance that the submariners will detect it its quite extraordinary said angus peetz a research aide to george foulkes a member of the british parliament who has pressed for a fullscale investigation of similar sub incidents off the british isles they can hit targets 2000 miles away but they cant spot a fishing boat above them while the issue of sub collisions is something relatively new to california mariners it has been a growing controversy in britain and ireland members of both the british and irish parliaments are demanding to know what role submarines may have played in the mysterious disappearances sinkings and snaggings of several dozen fishing boats in the irish sea resulting in the loss of more than 100 lives since 1980 officials with the us and british navies have said that their submarines have not been involved in fatal incidents in the area however officials in both navies have confirmed details of collisions and several snaggings involving submarines and civilian vessels the collisions naval experts say illustrate a point that remains true today surfacing from the deep is a maneuver that challenges even the most experienced skippers with the highesttech gadgets on board most vulnerable time its that time when the submarine is most vulnerable said hannifin who was commander of all us and nato submarines in the mediterranean from 1971 to 1973 then went on to become the director of the joint chiefs of staff hes really blind the problem is that a submarine completely submerged cant see anything it can hear but it cant see it can hear a fishing boat for example if the fishing boat is running its engines what it cant hear are fishing nets or barges being towed because barges dont make any noise in order to minimize the chances of running into another vessel submarines generally travel well below the surface when it is time to ascend they move swiftly to periscope depth there is a period truly of uncertainty as you go through this transition from the deep submerged state to a shallow submerged state and so you very carefully search around said capt thomas c maloney retired commanding officer of a nuclearpowered submarine of the same class as the houston you maneuver the ship to see if theres some target behind you maloney said and then you very quickly try to bring the ship up so you can look out through the periscope maloney described the transition period as a tensionfilled time and compared it to an automobile on a freeway once in a while you get ready to change lanes and all of a sudden you find theres somebody in your blind spot maloney said even though you thought youve done a pretty careful search masked sounds such events occur rarely maloney said and explanations vary sometimes another loud ship in the distance masks the sound of the closer ship he said or sometimes its simply a sailboat that was making no detectable noise still active sonar which is capable of detecting silent objects is rarely used using passive sonar a submarine crew member simply listens for noises but with active sonar the operator can send out sound waves that will bounce back to the submarine with a ping if it strikes an object the active system works best in detecting totally submerged objects maloney said but is less reliable when aimed at the surface depth water conditions surface waves and other variables all can generate sonar clutter that cuts down on reliability he said the overriding reason that active sonar is rarely used however is security when you use active sonar you give your position away said james bush a retired navy captain and former submarine commander who now works with the washingtonbased center for defense information active sonar is generally reserved for battle situations bush said youre going to shoot a torpedo at him anyway so why not make sure you know exactly where he is in any case bush and others said it is highly unlikely that any sonar system would detect a fishing net navy officials confirm that fishermen from around the world have been reimbursed for nets and catches lost when submarines accidentally sliced through them but precise figures were not made available last week bernard moffat general secretary of the celtic league an organization that fosters cooperation among the celtic areas of the british isles has been monitoring military activity in the narrow relatively shallow and heavily fished strip of sea between ireland and mainland britain known to submarine crew members as rats run 100 civilian deaths since 1980 he said there have been 21 disappearances of civilian vessels and more than 100 civilian deaths the incidents have occurred in calmtomoderate sea conditions and moffat claims that at least some of them probably are linked to submarines in 1982 the british navy paid damages after the submarine hms porpoise sank a fishing boat all crew members were rescued but us submarine involvement in other accidents is less certain moffat acknowledges that we cant say theyre definitely linked to submarines but he insists that in almost all cases the incidents occurred in what are listed on admiralty charts as designated submarine exercise areas us navy officials confirm only a handful of close encounters in the irish sea in april a british trawler named laurel was apparently snagged by an american sub off the isle of man the us navy released a report saying only that the crew had no indication of the snagging but minor paint scrapes found on the sub were assumed to be the result of the snagging an investigation is continuing the navy said three months earlier us officials say a surface collision occurred between a us submarine and the fishing vessel new dawn authorities are awaiting a resolution with the insurance company representing the boat owner netsnagging incidents in 1987 prompted the us navy to pay out more than 28000 british pounds in damages to the owners of the british fishing vessels heroine and summer morn
