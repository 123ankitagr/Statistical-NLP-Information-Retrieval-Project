George Whitmore , an author and playwright who wrote about the effect of AIDS on society and on his friends , then finally about his own expected death from complications of the disease , died Wednesday at New York Medical Center at age 43 . Whitmore wrote three plays -- `` The Caseworker , '' `` Flight -- The Legacy '' and `` The Rights '' -- and two novels : `` The Confessions of Danny Slocum , '' published in 1980 by St. Martin 's Press , and `` Nebraska , '' published in 1987 by Grove Press . He began by writing about gays facing the traditional mores of American culture . As the menace of acquired immune deficiency syndrome evolved , he turned to the struggle for acceptance among his friends and finally to his own dilemma . Whitmore also wrote `` Reaching Out to Someone With AIDS '' for The New York Times Magazine and later wrote a cover story for the magazine about his experience as an AIDS patient . In 1988 New American Library published his `` Someone Was Here : Profiles in the AIDS Epidemic , '' an outgrowth of his magazine articles . He also became known for suing a Greenwich Village dental clinic that refused to treat him because he had AIDS . Northern Dispensary was fined $ 47,000 by the city 's Human Rights Commission ; last month , officials announced that , because of financial pressures , the clinic would close and reopen as a nursing home for AIDS patients under the auspices of the Roman Catholic Diocese of New York . Born in Denver , Whitmore attended Bennington College and was a conscientious objector , choosing to work at Planned Parenthood of New York City in lieu of military service in the Vietnam War .
