Forest managers plan to spray bacteria on up to 105,000 acres of Plumas and Lassen national forests to combat the largest infestation of tussock moths in Northern California history . In June , airplanes will release droplets of Bacillus thuringiensis , a naturally occurring bacterium known as Bt , on the forests where the moths threaten to destroy 300 million board-feet of timber . Lawrence Crabtree , a U.S. Forest Service silviculturist who is coordinating the project , said the spraying will cost about $ 1.5 million . The moth , native to forests west of the Mississippi , typically experiences a population explosion every 10 to 12 years , Crabtree said . Tussock moths already have turned more than 50,000 acres of forest into a ghostly gray by nibbling the needles of white fir trees . Crabtree said larvae from millions of eggs laid last fall could spread the damage . Environmental groups said they may appeal , contending Bt also will kill other insects .
