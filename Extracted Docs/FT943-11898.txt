north korea has already developed five nuclear bombs and plans to build more a senior north korean defector claimed yesterday but the us later disputed this suggesting the figure was too high the defector mr kang myong-do a son-in-law of the north korean prime minister said the north's nuclear policy was to make about 10 nuclear bombs before revealing their existence he said the nuclear weapons programme was meant to protect the north against the us and south korea by possessing nuclear weapons north korea thinks it can be relieved from security worries and will be able to divert resources from the arms industry to agriculture and light industry he said this could help rescue the north's shrinking economy mr kang arrived in seoul from china in may but his defection was not disclosed until yesterday he appeared at a news conference with mr cho myong-chol the son of a former construction minister who defected last week they are the two most senior north korean officials to have fled to south korea their press conference appears to be part of a renewed propaganda war between seoul and pyongyang following the death of north korea's president kim's il-sung it was evidently meant to embarrass the north as it celebrated victory day marking the end of the korean war in 1953 north korea which routinely claims defectors have been kidnapped by seoul is likely to react strongly increased tension between the two koreas are reducing chances of a summit between their leaders after it was postponed on mr kim's death some analysts and us officials are sceptical of mr kang's claims doubting the north's technical capability to assemble nuclear devices as well as the number of bombs claimed by kang mr william perry us defence secretary said he stood behind a us intelligence estimate that north korea probably had reprocessed enough plutonium to build one or two nuclear bombs us state department spokesman mike mccurry conceded there was debate within intelligence ranks about the exact parameters of the north korean nuclear programme but the information provided by this defector falls well beyond and well outside of those parameters he said mr kang's claim that the north has developed five nuclear bombs was based on a discussion he had with a senior security official at the yongbyon nuclear complex the two defectors voiced opposition to mr kim jong-il's assumption of power after the death of his father president kim il-sung they said mr kim was in firm control having exercised extensive administrative powers since 1985 but food shortages and other economic problems threatened his rule while the military was divided in its loyalty to him mr kang said mr kim was trying his utmost to postpone international nuclear inspections until the north made as many nuclear warheads as it needed the north saw them as a card in negotiations with the us about diplomatic recognition and economic aid analysts are interested in the effect of mr kang's defection on the future of prime minister kang song-san third-ranking official in the north
