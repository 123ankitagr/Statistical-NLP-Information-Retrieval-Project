rewind the basketball vcr back to a time when a kid named earvin not yet magic wore out the sidewalks of lansing mich with his incessant dribbling the game revolved around centers wilt posted up wilt got the ball wilt dunked russell swatted away shot after shot sky hook entered the vernacular now fast-forward to 1990 earvin has long since become magic joined by friends known as isiah k j and stockton they do not play center but now the game revolves around them with all necessary apologies to patrick ewing akeem olajuwon and david robinson centers just aren't enough anymore basketball has grown stretched quickened point guards are hip got a great point guard you're in the hunt got an ordinary one forget it just ask akeem it's harder to find a great point guard than a player at any other position utah jazz president frank layden says it requires more skills and the biggest is to be a decision-maker the importance of great point men intensifies the search the jazz dipped into spokane wash in 1984, plucking unheralded john stockton from unheralded gonzaga university projected as rickey green's backup stockton instead became a star as utah knows that does not automatically mean a championship ring it's simply a key piece to the puzzle each of the last two nba finals have matched magic johnson and isiah thomas good buddies and top-flight point guards glen rice may have scored bushels of points but rumeal robinson was equally important to michigan's ncaa title team last spring pete newell who coached cal to the national championship in 1959 and now scouts for the cleveland cavaliers sees this as no coincidence you'll have a hard time winning a championship without a great point guard newell says and today great point guard has wider meaning than in the past point guards once did not worry about scoring dribble organize pass keep teammates happy maurice cheeks now with san antonio epitomizes that kind of point guard as he climbed the basketball ladder his job description seemed clear be a playmaker that's it cheeks says just pass nothing else it was never in my makeup to score 20-25 points a game now these guys are more able to score it's a time for younger guys who can score and penetrate they're more versatile they score they penetrate they pass they lead stockton and kevin johnson widely considered the leading point guards for the 90 s have firmly put an end to the old style johnson last season became only the fifth player in nba history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists joining magic thomas nate archibald and oscar robertson stockton averaged 17.1 points and a league-high 13.6 assists they are the wave of the future for several reasons as defenses expand more double-teaming more traps and thinly veiled zones coaches want swift point guards who can rush the ball upcourt create fast breaks or at least start the offense quickly and since the point guard most often has the ball he must be a threat to shoot the jump shot or drive to the basket forget about poor-shooting 10-points-per game stuff that's out magic says grimacing and shaking his head all these guys can score you've got to be a 17-12 man or 17-11 that 10 points just doesn't get it the defense will let you have the shot since this is a story about point guards we'll let johnson have the first shot he has earned it the magic man most conventional concepts of the point guard took a beating in the late 1970 s a tall guy with a wide smile emerged from everett high school in lansing then moved on to nearby michigan state they called him magic they said he played the point jerry reynolds the kings director of player personnel remembers his reaction when i first heard about him in college as a 6-9 point guard i said oh b s you're saying he's a point guard but he really isn't reynolds recalls then i saw him and he really was a point guard it was like seeing the pyramids for the first time earvin johnson handled the basketball as if he were 5-foot-9 he loved to push the ball upcourt where he could creatively pass off to teammates he had a funky ugly set shot which he made just 46 percent of the time in college but then point guards did not need a great shot neither did most 6-9 players johnson just never fit the traditional role of a big man comfortable only within an arm's reach of the basket i was tall but i could always dribble he says everywhere i went as a kid to the store wherever i dribbled i became a point guard because i dribbled so much and passing always gave me just as much satisfaction as shooting to make a good pass was like a rush a high and it still is johnson grew up admiring nate archibald taking ideas for passes from kevin porter and pete maravich porter played for johnson's home state detroit pistons and he still holds the nba single-game record of 29 assists that mark and not much else has eluded johnson his magical act which took michigan state to the 79 ncaa title became an instant nba hit in johnson's very first season 1979-80 he and skyhook inventor kareem abdul-jabbar led the los angeles lakers to the league championship in kareem's first four seasons in los angeles the lakers never won a title when a great point guard arrived they immediately did johnson has since added four more rings to his collection in becoming the player most synonymous with winning since bill russell he sparked a fashionable trend in high schools and on playgrounds across america suddenly tall kids wanted to handle the ball their coaches may not have trashed the idea as quickly as they once did well if magic can do it but no replica showed up in the 80 s we get carried away with magics says lee rose formerly a successful college coach and now the milwaukee bucks director of player personnel we think everybody's going to be a magic hell there's only one magic his ability to find those open men isn't necessarily because he's 6-9 a lot of people that height cannot do what he does if anything point guards have shrunk since johnson's entrance his chief rivals in the league today thomas stockton kevin johnson all must stretch to exceed six feet many respected basketball people hesitate to drop magic johnson into this group jerry west a decent player in his day harkens back to earlier times when speaking of johnson when guards were guards magic's a guard because he can do everything says west now the lakers general manager if you watch him magic is a pretty simple player he just has charisma when magic was born they sprinkled a little extra gold dust on him so how exactly do we measure johnson's impact on the position he clearly brought focus and attention to point men he helped accelerate the game into the open court where guards have more impact than centers and passing became a bit more chic i'd say i've made people aware of being a passer magic says players now are conscious of doing that since that's happened i feel good about it the evolution for all his wondrous achievements johnson did not hang around the peach basket with james naismith it only seems as if magic were there offering suggestions about how to position players in this new game actually the key moments in the evolution of the point guard are easily distinguishable the first sign of life occurred when big men stopped jumping so often before the war guards were great big plodding guys because there was a center-jump after every basket newell says the fast break started back then with the elimination of the center jump then in 1954, a major rule change forever changed the role of point guards dismayed by slowdown strategy and low-scoring games syracuse nationals owner danny biasone introduced the 24-second clock suddenly point guards such as bob cousy slater martin and dick mcguire spent less time dribbling around protecting leads and shooting free throws the clock made teams play and made point guards do more than handle the ball twenty-five years later another new rule completed the shape of today's game when the league adopted the three-point shot in 1979, defenses had even more to worry about
