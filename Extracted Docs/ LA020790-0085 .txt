rewind the basketball vcr back to a time when a kid named earvin not yet magic wore out the sidewalks of lansing mich with his incessant dribbling the game revolved around centers wilt posted up wilt got the ball wilt dunked russell swatted away shot after shot sky hook entered the vernacular now fastforward to 1990 earvin has long since become magic joined by friends known as isiah kj and stockton they do not play center but now the game revolves around them with all necessary apologies to patrick ewing akeem olajuwon and david robinson centers just arent enough anymore basketball has grown stretched quickened point guards are hip got a great point guard youre in the hunt got an ordinary one forget it just ask akeem its harder to find a great point guard than a player at any other position utah jazz president frank layden says it requires more skills and the biggest is to be a decisionmaker the importance of great point men intensifies the search the jazz dipped into spokane wash in 1984 plucking unheralded john stockton from unheralded gonzaga university projected as rickey greens backup stockton instead became a star as utah knows that does not automatically mean a championship ring its simply a key piece to the puzzle each of the last two nba finals have matched magic johnson and isiah thomas good buddies and topflight point guards glen rice may have scored bushels of points but rumeal robinson was equally important to michigans ncaa title team last spring pete newell who coached cal to the national championship in 1959 and now scouts for the cleveland cavaliers sees this as no coincidence youll have a hard time winning a championship without a great point guard newell says and today great point guard has wider meaning than in the past point guards once did not worry about scoring dribble organize pass keep teammates happy maurice cheeks now with san antonio epitomizes that kind of point guard as he climbed the basketball ladder his job description seemed clear be a playmaker thats it cheeks says just pass nothing else it was never in my makeup to score 2025 points a game now these guys are more able to score its a time for younger guys who can score and penetrate theyre more versatile they score they penetrate they pass they lead stockton and kevin johnson widely considered the leading point guards for the 90s have firmly put an end to the old style johnson last season became only the fifth player in nba history to average at least 20 points and 10 assists joining magic thomas nate archibald and oscar robertson stockton averaged 171 points and a leaguehigh 136 assists they are the wave of the future for several reasons as defenses expand more doubleteaming more traps and thinly veiled zones coaches want swift point guards who can rush the ball upcourt create fast breaks or at least start the offense quickly and since the point guard most often has the ball he must be a threat to shoot the jump shot or drive to the basket forget about poorshooting 10pointspergame stuff thats out magic says grimacing and shaking his head all these guys can score youve got to be a 1712 man or 1711 that 10 points just doesnt get it the defense will let you have the shot since this is a story about point guards well let johnson have the first shot he has earned it the magic man most conventional concepts of the point guard took a beating in the late 1970s a tall guy with a wide smile emerged from everett high school in lansing then moved on to nearby michigan state they called him magic they said he played the point jerry reynolds the kings director of player personnel remembers his reaction when i first heard about him in college as a 69 point guard i said oh bs youre saying hes a point guard but he really isnt reynolds recalls then i saw him and he really was a point guard it was like seeing the pyramids for the first time earvin johnson handled the basketball as if he were 5foot9 he loved to push the ball upcourt where he could creatively pass off to teammates he had a funky ugly set shot which he made just 46 percent of the time in college but then point guards did not need a great shot neither did most 69 players johnson just never fit the traditional role of a big man comfortable only within an arms reach of the basket i was tall but i could always dribble he says everywhere i went as a kid to the store wherever i dribbled i became a point guard because i dribbled so much and passing always gave me just as much satisfaction as shooting to make a good pass was like a rush a high and it still is johnson grew up admiring nate archibald taking ideas for passes from kevin porter and pete maravich porter played for johnsons home state detroit pistons and he still holds the nba singlegame record of 29 assists that mark and not much else has eluded johnson his magical act which took michigan state to the 79 ncaa title became an instant nba hit in johnsons very first season 197980 he and skyhook inventor kareem abduljabbar led the los angeles lakers to the league championship in kareems first four seasons in los angeles the lakers never won a title when a great point guard arrived they immediately did johnson has since added four more rings to his collection in becoming the player most synonymous with winning since bill russell he sparked a fashionable trend in high schools and on playgrounds across america suddenly tall kids wanted to handle the ball their coaches may not have trashed the idea as quickly as they once did well if magic can do it but no replica showed up in the 80s we get carried away with magics says lee rose formerly a successful college coach and now the milwaukee bucks director of player personnel we think everybodys going to be a magic hell theres only one magic his ability to find those open men isnt necessarily because hes 69 a lot of people that height can not do what he does if anything point guards have shrunk since johnsons entrance his chief rivals in the league today thomas stockton kevin johnson all must stretch to exceed six feet many respected basketball people hesitate to drop magic johnson into this group jerry west a decent player in his day harkens back to earlier times when speaking of johnson when guards were guards magics a guard because he can do everything says west now the lakers general manager if you watch him magic is a pretty simple player he just has charisma when magic was born they sprinkled a little extra gold dust on him so how exactly do we measure johnsons impact on the position he clearly brought focus and attention to point men he helped accelerate the game into the open court where guards have more impact than centers and passing became a bit more chic id say ive made people aware of being a passer magic says players now are conscious of doing that since thats happened i feel good about it the evolution for all his wondrous achievements johnson did not hang around the peach basket with james naismith it only seems as if magic were there offering suggestions about how to position players in this new game actually the key moments in the evolution of the point guard are easily distinguishable the first sign of life occurred when big men stopped jumping so often before the war guards were great big plodding guys because there was a centerjump after every basket newell says the fast break started back then with the elimination of the center jump then in 1954 a major rule change forever changed the role of point guards dismayed by slowdown strategy and lowscoring games syracuse nationals owner danny biasone introduced the 24second clock suddenly point guards such as bob cousy slater martin and dick mcguire spent less time dribbling around protecting leads and shooting free throws the clock made teams play and made point guards do more than handle the ball twentyfive years later another new rule completed the shape of todays game when the league adopted the threepoint shot in 1979 defenses had even more to worry about
