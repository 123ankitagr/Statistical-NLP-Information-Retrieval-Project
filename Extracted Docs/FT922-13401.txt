my life in politics by willy brandt hamish hamilton pounds 20 498 pages willy brandt is one of the three great statesmen of postwar europe the others are konrad adenauer and charles de gaulle to whom brandt pays tribute although more to the frenchman than his fellow german all three saw the francogerman relationship as crucial to european peace where brandt differed is that he came of working class origins and belonged to the democratic left almost from the start no one should underestimate the tribulations of adenauer and de gaulle but brandt probably had a harder life as full of downs as ups and sometimes vilified by his own people he survived to develop the fruits of their labours and to make decisive contributions of his own it is typical of the man that he has produced a somewhat rambling political life he notes that it is simpler to write a book alone than with dozen other people that is what he seems to have done my life in politics is brandt writing personally rather than another brandt report the book jumps all over the place starting with the crises in postwar berlin reverting to childhood moving to his role in government then covering his remarkably long political afterlife following his resignation as federal chancellor in 1974 yet the theme of a peaceful germany in harmony with its neighbours is never far away brandts aim was no less than that and probably no more german unification would never have come about so quickly without the emergence of gorbachev but brandts policy of small steps helped clear the way as did the policies of adenauer and de gaulle before him in these memoirs it is impossible not to detect a perceived continuity adenauer saw his task as the first federal chancellor in cementing relations with the west and making germany respectable he told brandt that the soviet union would not be able to stand up to pressures from both china and the west indefinitely therefore changes in eastern europe might come eventually de gaulle pondered movement east of the elbe before most germans seriously began to contemplate it brandt salutes him he had ventured to think utopian thoughts of a permanently peaceful europe in his perceptions he came closer to a whole europe than any of those who wanted to adapt too fast and too permanently to the postwar landscape what most people outside failed to understand was how firm relations between bonn and paris had become that was particularly true of the british brandt tells how george brown as foreign secretary said willy you must get us into europe so we can take the lead he admits that in common with leading british politicians he did not see britain as an essential part of europe except in times of war it was france that mattered so did poland while adenauer thought that europe stopped at the elbe and drew the curtains at magdeburg so he did not have to see the steppes of asia brandt believed that the same historical rank had to be given to reconciliation between germans and poles as between germans and french that was one of his great achievements as chancellor brandt attaches special importance to place he thinks that adenauer was governed by being a rhinelander and considered himself more a west german than simply a german coming from lubeck and spending his formative years in voluntary exile in scandinavia brandt was subject to different influences that affected both his view of germany and social democracy he regrets that he has not been given enough credit for his role as a reforming chancellor in domestic policy following the swedish model we should not take the geographical influence too far helmut schmidt came from nearby hamburg and did not have the same views on social democracy brandt says that the difference there was one of temperament both brandt and schmidt at times must have both been prickly to work with there is a bitter chapter on brandts resignation as chancellor after the discovery of an east german spy on his personal staff he writes now that he should never have gone that does not accord with his mood of the time when he seemed exhausted it is also odd that he should poke fun at ludwig erhard for having asked as economics minister how much it would cost to buy east germany from the russians after all that is nearly what happened in the end
