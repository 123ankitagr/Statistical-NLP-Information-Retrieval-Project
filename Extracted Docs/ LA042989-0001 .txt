in their first public appearance since the march 10 bombing of their van on a la jolla street navy capt will rogers iii and his wife sharon said friday that she will not return to her fourthgrade teaching position at la jolla country day school the rogerses speaking at a news conference sharply denounced the exclusive private school for bowing to what apparently was an act of terrorism under a severance agreement sharon rogers who taught 12 years at the school will receive a lump sum of $ 135000 plus $ 5000 for her legal fees and will not return to the campus where school officials believe her presence would pose a risk to students and faculty the fbi has been investigating the bombing as a possible reprisal for capt rogers order to shoot down an iranian passenger jet that neared his ship the guided missile cruiser vincennes in the persian gulf last summer all 290 people aboard the plane were killed simply just disappointed over the past weeks i have felt many different emotions but today i am simply just disappointed said sharon rogers fighting back tears more disappointed than i can possibly express i will miss my relationship with the school but most of all i will miss my students and their courageous and thoughtful parents both capt rogers and his wife said they believe the van bombing was an act of terrorism mrs rogers added that the school by barring her from campus was sending out a message that it was bowing to terrorism i feel very sad for our country she said bernie fipp president of the schools board of trustees said in a letter friday to the schools parents and staffers that safety was the prime reason for the schools decision that mrs rogers not return to teach her fourthgraders the school believed and continues to believe that sharons presence on campus would pose an unreasonable risk to the children at the school fipp said the school believes that the presence of the 24hour federal protection now being offered to sharon is evidence of the risks involved school action criticized the school with 700 students and 67 teachers has been the subject of intense criticism both in san diego and across the country including a pointed comment from the white house in the weeks since the attack one of the toughest questions facing the school administration was why it moved so quickly to remove sharon rogers from the faculty without waiting to see whether the fbi determines that the bombing was indeed a terrorist act agents of the federal bureau of investigation other than confirming that the explosive device was a pipe bomb have declined to reveal the status of their continuing probe sharon rogers was not injured in the van blast feeling a jolt and thinking that her van had been hit from behind she had jumped from the van moments before it was engulfed in flames but she described that incident as a lifealtering event highlighted by the ensuing battle over whether she would be allowed to return to her job sharon rogers and her husband were escorted to the press conference at a mission valley hotel by a large contingent of security officials from the naval investigative service she wore a red dress and he wore a blue blazer and red slacks when they sat down before the microphones the security officers posted themselves at both entrances to the room and in the parking lot as well sharon rogers maintained that the school would be secure with her there because of the added nis protection i think they would be very safe with the nis agents there she said timothy m burns the schools headmaster who came under sharp criticism from some parents and teachers over his handling of the rogers affair could not be reached for comment friday richard roth a pasadena public relations specialist hired by the school said the 18member boards vote friday morning was not unanimous but overwhelmingly in favor of approval of the decision to sever ties with sharon rogers he said that the headmaster normally approves or rejects teaching contracts without board action but this was not a contract issue roth said this was a legal issue and its appropriate for the board to take up matters of legal consideration asked why the board agreed to pay her $ 135000 when her current contract is for $ 32400 annually roth said we want to avoid a legal action instead of paying legal fees from a lawsuit we believe it is more appropriate to provide sharon with this compensation after the bombing the school told mrs rogers not to return to the campus for the rest of this school year faced with criticism for making her a victim a second time the school offered her two contract options for the school year beginning in september both were contingent on being assured that safety concerns could be met sharon rogers submitted a counterproposal asking for $ 200000 over five years if she were prevented from returning to school because of safety concerns capt rogers said he is disappointed in the way the school treated his wife but he said he is proud of the way she held up after suffering the horror of having a terrorist light a fireball under her van shes a lady of iron he said placing his arm around her shoulders whenever she choked back tears theres a lot of grit here both sharon rogers and her husband said they are convinced that the bombing was a terrorist strike i think that someone in the dead of night put a bomb on the undercarriage of my van and whoever that person was is a terrorist sharon rogers said her husband added i think they will run aground and they will be brought to justice whether its a statesponsored act or an individual act or a disgruntled sailor whatever it will be it will all come to light even if its a high school kid experimenting with a pvc bomb or the revolutionary guard the problem is there its terrorism no matter how you cut it but he said he had fully expected the school to welcome her back he also said he sympathizes with his wife for the intense media and community scrutiny she has faced i had the misfortune of being at the center of my 15 minutes of fame earlier he said referring to his decision to shoot down the iranian plane but time does heal a lot of things and you take a step at a time so i was very disappointed when the reaction on the part of the school occurred although mrs rogers said recent events have dramatically changed her life she said she plans to begin seeking work at another school in the san diego area im going to start pounding the pavement next week she said im going to update my resume and hit the bricks on monday
