when glenn silber was told in december that the small private school his preschooler had been attending for six months was in danger of going under his first thought was to pull his son out then silber and other parents like him thought again instead of walking away from los feliz hills school a nonprofit school that had been without a director for months they decided to try to save it silbers wife claudia took over the business office another parent mary louise grady became the receptionist last week glenn silber joined the schools board of directors and four more parents have applied if they are accepted the board will expand to 11 members and parents have spent the last few sundays refurbishing school buildings the parents say the school of 181 children ages 2 to 18 is worth saving the classes are small the teachers are bright and committed and the campus whose futuristic buildings were designed by los angeles architect john lautner in 1960 is an oasis of greenery on 64 acres in the midst of the urban landscape the parents say but as the parents sift through piles of poorly organized bank statements and enrollment statistics they are encountering obstacles that might give even experienced administrators pause there are enormous debts to be paid and basic classroom equipment to be bought they say and while the school is staffed with experienced teachers the absence of a director for a short but crucial fourmonth period left it lacking direction there has been no center no lightning rod for the school in recent years said christopher geissmann who took over as director of the school a few weeks ago teachers had a vague idea that they wanted a caring friendly atmosphere with a minimum of rules no uniforms that sort of thing but what was missing was a sense of clarity of how all this related to some larger goal the los feliz hills school has had four names and five directors since its founding in 1960 it has been variously an alternative school that taught the children of liberalminded celebrities a shortlived cooperative a school closely affiliated with the nearby church of scientology and most recently a school with a dynamic director who built a strong teaching staff but ignored the schools worsening financial problems today the school owes more than $ 117000 in mortgage payments and is running a deficit of $ 14000 to $ 20000 a month enrollment once at 335 has dropped 40 students lower than what is needed to break even the heating does not work some of the buildings are in disrepair and the school on a bluff at the end of russell avenue is so lowprofile that most people do not know it is there still parents of children at the school for the most part young couples successful enough to afford tuition payments ranging from $ 2600 to $ 4410 a year say there is something special about the place this is a community and theres this love that people have for the school and for one another that makes us want to keep the school going said christie davis who heads the schools newly formed parents advisory council chance to survive because they believe in the school parents say they are working hard to give it a chance to survive in december they raised more than $ 70000 among themselves in the schools firstever fund drive last month they formed a committee to recruit students and a group of parents met with some of the creditors who have been demanding for months to be paid they worked out a plan with the creditors to gain more time to pay off the schools loans a parent who works as a graphic artist is designing a new logo for the school another is writing a new brochure next week the school will hold an open house its a disaster but were going to survive silber said i feel that with all the energy i would expend trying to find an adequate preschool i might as well expend it making sure this one is running correctly i mean what the hell im not the type to roll over and where else is my kid going to go the school is one of the few in the country catering to such a wide age range geissmann said its campus consists of 14 buildings and several playing fields framed by los felizs graceful shakespeare bridge it has about 52 students in its preschool classes 72 in its elementary school and 57 in grades nine through 12 every student in last years graduating class went on to college geissmann said some to stanford university cornell university occidental college and uc santa cruz the place is refreshingly reminiscent of a mission because there is a sense of missionary zeal and fervor among the teachers and the students said thomas c hudnut headmaster of the prestigious harvard school in north hollywood people were really excited about working together i think that although there are things that require attention the future is generally bright for los feliz hills experiential education in its various incarnations the school has had a reputation for practicing what is called experiential education the philosophy that children of all ages learn best by doing experiential classes are less structured than traditional class settings with children learning geometry for example by measuring buildings and working out theorems from what they have observed founded in the 1960s as the midtown school the nonprofit school was a small but thriving alternative institution known as a place where hollywood celebrities sent their children jane fonda sent her children there so did mama cass of the mamas and the papas bonnie bishop took over the school in 1974 and under her tenure it became affiliated with the church of scientology the association afforded bishop a ready pool of students the children of people affiliated with scientology founder l ron hubbards movement but when bishop and the church parted company 10 years later enrollment sank from 335 students to 74 as scientologists pulled their children out bishop a scientologist had changed the schools name to the apple school hired teachers who were also scientologists and used educational principles developed by hubbard and codified in a manual he wrote called the basic study manual in an interview with two times reporters several years ago bishop said she paid the church for the use of hubbards teaching methods eventually handing over 15 of the schools revenues to the church of scientology bishop told the times that she began in 1979 to believe that the fees she was paying to the church were exorbitant she stopped paying the fees but continued to use hubbards techniques in 1983 according to bishop and to an internal church memorandum church officials began to demand money from the school again threatening to charge bishop with copyright infringement stigma noted in 1985 bishop left the school and the teachers she hired left with her parents and teachers say the school has been stigmatized with the scientology image ever since the unfairness is that if we had stayed a scientology school we wouldnt be having all these troubles said teacher stevie gere we ran off the scientologists we stood up to them and still people think were closet scientologists or something it makes my blood boil in 1987 with enrollment down to 132 students the schools board of directors hired as headmaster mike dornellas a veteran educator who had worked as a teacher and administrator at schools and colleges throughout southern california dornellas said in a recent interview that he was tired of the public school bureaucracy and excited about the chance to make his mark at a small private school working 12hour days dornellas began to turn the place around he fired 18 of the schools 19 teachers and hired a staff of 26 new ones to attract quality educators he raised salaries and added full medical benefits he hired an educational consultant to revamp the curriculum ridding it of its last vestiges of scientology teachings he worked nights and weekends gaining the trust and affection of students and parents alike early last year dornellas won for the school a measure of legitimacy that it never had before accreditation from the western assn of schools and colleges one of six regional accrediting bodies in the nation recognized by the us department of education dornellas efforts seemed to be paying off the schools teacherstudent ratio dropped from one teacher for every 13 students to one for every eight enrollment climbed to 220 students on the right track mikes presence seemed to verify that everything was on the right track said bill taylor president of the schools board of directors he was very popular with the staff and he was able to develop confidence among the students his strong personality calmed the troubled waters that we had among our parents but the new school dornellas was creating cost money and debts mounted fast last spring dornellas was diagnosed with bladder cancer and began slowing down and taking time off i manage more by personality than by policy and as long as i was there we had a positive program dornellas said when i wasnt there the things that needed to be done didnt get done i feel like i failed there like i bailed out on the school in october when dornellas cancer spread to his lymphatic system he took a leave of absence the board of directors was left to sort through its financial obligations were not professional educators or professional businessmen we just got involved because we wanted to taylor said we knew that we had to go out and hire professional consultants or something but none of us knew how to do that because were mostly just concerned parents the school operated without a director from october through the end of january with the board confronting administrative problems it had always left to the director to cut costs the board trimmed faculty and limited school supplies board members also interviewed applicants to take dornellas place at the end of last month geissmann took over a graduate of harvard and yale phillips academy and the trinity school in new york geissmann is in the habit of quoting nietzsche and socrates in the same sentence and prefers the title headmaster to that of director he said he wants to make the school more intellectually rigorous a place where children can read and discuss books together in a tranquil unpressured environment critical thinking i want to see the children here develop a kind of critical thinking in the sense of questioning so theyre not thrown by controversy or conflict geissmann said for that i think you have to be intellectually exciting and intense but at the same time create a sense of tradition were still in the embryonic stage now geissmann however is an educator not a businessman and it is unclear who will take fulltime responsibility to get the school out of financial jeopardy but parents say they are not ready to give up theres a certain element of dream involved theres a dream that the school can survive can become healthy can become known for a very strong academic program that can serve this community taylor said its a chance to build something so you seize it and you just refuse to let go
