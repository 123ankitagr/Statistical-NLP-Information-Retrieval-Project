your editorial a mayor or a marshmallow oct 11 leads me to the conclusion you're out of touch with the citizens of irvine the voters spoke by a 52 48 vote to not reelect larry agran you do a disservice to the city voters when you fail to recognize what in most elections would be considered a landslide you're right when you said we failed to reelect an international diplomat in agran i question your description however we defeated a man who put his own political ambitions ahead of the interests of irvine every city with an elected mayor is governed by machine politics mayor bradley is out raising 750,000 to cover legal fees for his conflict-of-interest lawsuit is sacramento better now that we have paid career politicians controlled by lobbyists instead of our former citizen politicians i am a very independent voter and i'm not a supporter of sally anne sheridan but to call her a pothole-fixing mayor is demeaning you should look at one of the cleanest political cities in the united states cincinnati the mayor elected by fellow councilmen no political machine just honest government serving the people we've got a lot of wounds to bind in this city your editorial contributes nothing to it it just illustrates that the media like congress are out of touch leslie j racey irvine
