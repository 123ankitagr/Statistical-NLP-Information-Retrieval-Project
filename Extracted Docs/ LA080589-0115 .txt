if this week's indictments of 46 chicago commodities traders have you scared about futures markets you're not alone even without the scandal it is risky territory at least four of five individual investors who dabble in futures lose money and that's assuming their trades are handled properly as is the case most of the time since most brokers are honest this week's developments show that even some of the most sophisticated professionals don't know when they are being cheated by illicit trades victims of some of the indicted broker-traders actually thought they were getting good fills or prices at which their trades were executed instead however they may have been victims of front running in which a broker-trader illegally trades for his personal account first profiting from the price movement that will result from the customer order in other cases brokers were alleged to have skimmed customer funds kept more profitable trades for themselves or committed other transgressions but if you still want to include futures as part of your investment strategy knowing that you can earn far more than in stocks bonds or real estate if you make the right moves the chicago probe provides some insights into how to reduce your chances of getting taken know with whom you are dealing although it is no guarantee that you won't get hurt deal with reputable firms make sure that your broker is registered with the commodity futures trading commission and is a member of the national futures assn an industry watchdog group to do that contact the nfa at 800 621-3570 or 200 w madison st suite 1600, chicago ill 60606 soon the nfa might also have records on whether your broker has ever been disciplined by any of the exchanges keep vigilant monitor your trades like a hawk keep good notes review your confirmation statements carefully don't lose touch with your money says robert k wilmouth president of the nfa complain vigorously if you suspect bad trades call your broker immediately and gripe loudly don't expect anyone else to be vigilant for you i wonder how much the big brokerage firms watch every trade says robert n gordon president of twenty-first securities a new york trading house that uses futures if your complaint is serious and corrective action hasn't been taken consider complaining to the exchanges or to the nfa they offer arbitration procedures for investors the commodity futures trading commission also handles complaints the nfa acts as a clearing house for information on grievances to complain or find out more about arbitration contact the nfa be wary of market orders some longtime investors avoid making so-called market orders the type that require the floor broker to execute at the best possible price at the time the order hits the trading pits those orders are most vulnerable to abuse to see that your market orders are satisfactorily executed you must monitor a computer showing the exact price movements at the time of your order says almer orr iii president of a o management corp a pittsburgh firm that manages commodity investments otherwise you may never know whether you've been shortchanged he says once you're leaving your destiny in someone else's hand you're open for the type of fraud that goes on orr says similarly orr says be wary about placing orders to be executed at the open or close of trading those also are vulnerable to abuses such as front running or prearranged trading between collaborating brokers accordingly orr suggests stick largely to limit orders in which you specify the exact price you want for your trade there are drawbacks to these orders too however if the market moves too fast and thus away from the price you specified your order may not be executed unless you specify a new limit order consider professional management if you can't monitor the markets constantly then you probably have no business trading futures on your own instead consider hiring a professional commodity manager or invest in a private or public commodity pool or fund they are like mutual funds in that they invest in futures and are professionally managed their professional managers are in a better position to make sure you don't get cheated public commodity funds are run as limited partnerships and require initial investments of as little as 3,000, says leon rose publisher of managed account reports a columbia md newsletter that tracks these funds privately run commodity pools also qualify as limited partners but require a bit more as an initial investment say 5,000 to 10,000, he says having your own manager may require at least 50,000 some public funds have performed quite well with some gaining more than 100 annually in recent years on average they have posted gains in four of the past five years rose says but individual funds can lose big amounts they key is finding a fund manager with a good long-term record in both good and bad markets several firms monitor commodity pools and funds one of the best known is managed account reports write them at 5513 twin knolls road columbia md 21045, for a free sample bill sing welcomes readers comments and suggestions for columns but regrets that he
