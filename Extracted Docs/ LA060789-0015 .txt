CBS Records is changing the title of country music star George Jones ' latest song , `` Ya Ba Da Ba Do ( So Are You ) , '' to avoid infringing on trademark rights held by cartoon caveman Fred Flintstone 's owner , Hanna-Barbera Productions . Starting today , the title of the single , No . 26 and climbing on the country charts , will be `` The King Is Gone ( So Are You ) , '' CBS Records said . Stickers with the new title are on the way to record stores to be pasted on all cassettes , compact discs , albums and singles and CBS is asking radio stations to refer to the song by its new title . In a statement , CBS Records said , `` CBS and Hanna-Barbera have agreed that the general public be notified that the song , 'Ya Ba Da Ba Do ( So Are You ) ' is not endorsed by Hanna-Barbera Productions Inc. or is in any way connected with 'The Flintstones . '' ' The song , written by Nashville 's Roger Ferris , is a humorous look at a man drowning his sorrows with a `` Jim Beam decanter that looks like Elvis '' being poured into a Flintstones ' jelly jar . `` Yabba-dabba-doo , the King is gone and so are you , '' the refrain goes .
