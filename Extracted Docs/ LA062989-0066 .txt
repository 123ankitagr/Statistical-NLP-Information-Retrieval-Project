Ventura Mayor Jim Monahan says it may be a long time before the city ever again lets a film company take over City Hall . Monahan voiced his disillusionment with the ways of Hollywood this week after a production company filming `` The Two Jakes , '' Jack Nicholson 's sequel to `` Chinatown , '' finally pulled up stakes . For two weeks , during debate over Ventura 's critical growth plan for the next two decades , Monahan and other City Council members became virtual political nomads . Abandoning the City Council chambers to Nicholson 's film crew for a court scene , the council met first in makeshift surroundings at Buena High School , then in some borrowed county conference space . When the filming ended , Monahan said , the city had a lot of dirty City Hall carpets to worry about and a complaint from movie producer Harold Schneider of Ojai that the city had overcharged him for use of its facilities . `` The whole thing was too disruptive of business at City Hall , '' Monahan said . `` More than I anticipated . My experience is that we should think long and hard before we do something like this again . '' Adding insult to the entire experience , according to Monahan , was his treatment when he tried to present Nicholson with a key to the city of Ventura . While Monahan eventually delivered the key to Nicholson via a secretary , the mayor said Schneider initially told him , `` We do n't accept that kind of crap . ''
