as the japanese authorities prepare to issue a gold coin to mark the forthcoming wedding of crown prince naruhito there was a reminder yesterday of the embarrassing fiasco that followed the hirohito coin issue in 1986 lawyers for mr paul davies a uk coin dealer were back in court in tokyo claiming compensation of y320m usdollars 27m plus interest from the japanese government and the tokyo metropolitan government for 3200 hirohito coins which he claims were illegally confiscated by tokyo police in february 1990 at that time the police claimed the coins were forgeries and said they had uncovered japans largest known counterfeiting case they alleged that the coins were part of a consignment of 107000 then worth usdollars 70m suspected of being counterfeits and imported to japan from the middle east through european intermediaries mr davies a 41yearold barrister who set up a coin dealing business in ilkley west yorkshire 20 years ago has always protested his coins were genuine no charges have ever been brought against him even though he has frequently been back to japan to fight his case he suggests the tokyo police effectively abandoned their investigations in the summer of 1990 since he began his civil action a year ago there have been six court hearings at which written evidence has been presented at yesterdays hearing evidence presented by mr ernest newman former chief metallurgist at the uk royal mint was critical of a report previously submitted by the finance ministrys osaka mint once again mr newman insisted that the confiscated coins were genuine the finance ministry made a huge profit on the hirohito coins because they were priced at y100000 each pounds 580 at the present exchange rate twice the value then of the 30 grams of gold they contained however as the coins were legal tender and the bank of japan was obliged to buy them back at y100000 each there were obvious risks that forgers might try to cash in on the premium between the gold content and the legaltender price uncertainties about the hirohito coins caused the japanese authorities to delay by several months the launch of gold coins to commemorate emperor akihitos accession to the throne more gold was put into the coins and the number issued was substantially reduced to 2m compared with 10m hirohitos the finance ministry says 2m gold coins will also be issued to mark the crown princes wedding but so far have given no other details meanwhile mr davies expects it will take many more months before the court rules on his action
