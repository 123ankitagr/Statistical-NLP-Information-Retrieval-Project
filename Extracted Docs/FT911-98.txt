AUSTRALIA yesterday rejected EC claims that it would be forced to tone down its campaign in Gatt 's Uruguay Round for free trade in agricultural products , Kevin Brown reports from Sydney . Mr Ray MacSharry , EC agriculture commissioner , had suggested Australia would be forced to soften its stance under pressure for subsidies from farmers hit by recession and falling world prices . Mr Neal Blewett , trade negotiations minister , said Mr MacSharry 's remarks were 'discouraging and inaccurate ' , and claimed Australia was resisting pressure for subsidies . The EC should emulate Australia 's 'political courage ' by moving away from export subsidies to farmers , he told parliament . Australia chairs the Cairns Group of farm exporting nations , which has pushed strongly for extending trade liberalisation to food products . Australia 's refusal to aid wheat growers , partly from fear of weakening its Gatt negotiating stance , has been attacked by its farming groups , which say planting for next year 's crop could be cut 35 per cent . But Canberra has approved a ADollars 100m ( Pounds 45m ) rise in the Grains Council of Australia 's borrowing limit , to allow advance payments to growers , and has expanded its Rural Adjustment Scheme , to help farmers cope .
