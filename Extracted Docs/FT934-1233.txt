mercury the main competitor to british telecommunications is taking the industry's watchdog to court in the first legal action to be pursued against a regulator of the former state utilities mercury claims that oftel the telecoms regulator has not offered it reasonable terms for the carriage of its traffic by bt through a consistent misinterpretation of bt's licence the legal challenge reflects mercury's mounting frustration at the impact of the current inter-connection regime on its ability to compete against bt mercury a long-distance carrier with about 10 per cent of the uk telecom market uses bt's network to deliver most of its calls to their final destination it pays bt on a per-minute basis using bt's charge bands mercury wants oftel to introduce a radically different structure based on network capacity which it claims would enable it to break free of bt's tariff structure mr mike harris mercury's chief executive said we are determined to use every means possible to break bt's dominance on this occasion it means using the courts earlier this month oftel settled a long-running dispute between bt and mercury on interconnection terms reducing the amount paid by mercury oftel refused to shift the basis of payment to capacity-based charging it is examining the future of the interconnection regime separately and has invited mercury to submit detailed proposals it claims mercury has yet to do so mercury is not attempting to challenge oftel's recent settlement instead it is seeking a declaratory judgment from the high court which if successful will form the basis for its next inter-connection agreement with bt negotiations for which are expected to start next year mr don cruickshank oftel director-general told an ft conference earlier this month that he wanted to move towards a pricing regime for interconnection which left competitors unconstrained by bt's own tariff structure mercury said yesterday it was not prepared to wait the few years it would take him to implement changes
