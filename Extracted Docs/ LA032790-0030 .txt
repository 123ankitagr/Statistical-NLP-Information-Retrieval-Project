State agriculture officials announced Monday the discovery of a single Mexican fruit fly in East Los Angeles , triggering a round of intensive trapping in the area . The fly , which was found Friday in an orange tree , threatens many of the same fruits as the Mediterranean fruit fly . Officials said there are no plans now to conduct aerial malathion sprayings because only a single fly was found . The Medfly infestation in Los Angeles and Orange counties now covers about 500 square miles and is the largest in Southern California 's history .
