The Telegraph 's first-quarter results provide strong evidence that the UK advertising recovery is gathering pace . Advertising revenue was up 18 per cent on the same period last year and is now near the peak it reached in 1989 . Moreover , the Telegraph expects advertising to continue rising as the general economic recovery becomes more established . There is clearly scope for growth in display and recruitment advertising which are still a long way below the 1989 level . Other evidence confirms the Telegraph story of an insipid recovery in 1993 being followed by a much stronger 1994 . United Newspapers painted a similar picture at its annual general meeting this week , while News Corporation last week said revenues at its UK newspapers had risen 11 per cent . The pattern of the advertising recovery has similarities with recoveries from previous recessions . But there is one important difference this time round ; during the latest recession , newspapers added to their pagination . The result was that advertising rates fell faster than revenues . The Telegraph 's financial advertising rates in its first quarter increased only in line with inflation , though revenues grew strongly . This suggests the capacity to carry advertising built up during the recession will continue to moderate increases in rates for some time even though volumes may boom .
