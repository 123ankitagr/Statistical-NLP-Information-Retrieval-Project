Neighbors armed with garden hoses battled to keep one house fire from spreading to another on their Newport Beach street Thursday night until firefighters could arrive . `` They really kept the flames from hitting my house , '' said Olive Kirkpatrick , 60 , referring to her neighbors , who helped to save her house in the 200 block of Orange Avenue . Kirkpatrick said the fire began in a house next to hers about 8:30 p.m. while she and her husband were reading newspapers . `` We heard a constant popping , '' she said . `` When we ran outside , the upstairs of the neighbor 's house was on fire . '' Kirkpatrick and her neighbors used four garden hoses to wet the side of her house before 29 firefighters from Newport Beach , Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach arrived . The firefighters took about 10 minutes to contain the blaze in neighbor Richard Sullivan 's house , which was burning too much for the garden hoses to make an impact . Fire Department spokeswoman Bonny Hanson said the fire caused $ 30,000 damage to Sullivan 's house . Sullivan was not home when the blaze started . Hanson said the cause of the fire , which started in an upstairs office , is still being investigated . The Kirkpatricks ' house , which is about six feet from the Sullivan residence , suffered burned eaves and broken windows . `` We 're really lucky , '' said Kirkpatrick , adding that the roof of her house was destroyed three years ago in another fire . `` I kept wondering whether it would happen again . The firemen said if they got there a minute later , our house would have caught fire . ''
