After squandering a 16-point second half lead and losing to Cal , 66-63 , on Wednesday , the Cardinal was n't about to give in again . `` We were really ready to compete , '' Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said . `` That was the best 40 minutes of basketball we 've played all year . It 's hard to believe that we won by 20 here at Cal . '' In the second half , Smith and Hendrick were saddled on the bench with foul trouble and Cal 's offense was never the same . `` Obviously , Stanford played a very fine game , but the foul trouble really hurt us , '' Cal Coach Lou Campanelli said `` We were tentative in the second half and we were n't able to do the things we needed to do to win .
