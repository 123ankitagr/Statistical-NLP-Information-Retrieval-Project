a strange thing happened earlier this month airlines announced their january fare wars a month early cruise lines began offering hundreds of substantial last-minute discounts even upscale resorts and hotels in some of the more desirable vacation destinations began to discount suddenly the winter of the travel industry's discontent has created a buyer's market for holiday deals on dec 12, delta airlines announced to members of its frequent-flier program that it would give a free ticket for passengers flying as few as two round trips the move was significant in that delta is an airline that had previously refused to start any kind of fare war or fare discounting actually it all started in late november when continental then on the verge of bankruptcy announced a two-for-one deal anyone who purchased a round-trip maxsaver fare ticket to selected destinations before nov 30 could take along a companion for free within hours a number of airlines matched the deal two weeks later came the delta bombshell traffic has been soft admits delta spokesman vince durocher and we looked at our advance bookings which were also down so we did it to stimulate our passenger loads among those who fly us already we wanted to spur business travel predictably the delta offer good until march has sparked a frequent-flier air-fare war among rival airlines within hours of delta's announcement american united northwest twa and continental had announced their own programs american's offer fly three round trips or eight separate flights get one free round-trip ticket or fly five round trips or 14 separate flights and get two free round trips and you get three round trips for flying seven round trips or 20 separate flights the northwest program is similar fly three round trips or eight separate flights between now and march 25, 1991, and get a free coach-class ticket fly five round trips and northwest gives you a free ticket to europe fly seven round trips and get hawaii united goes one step further fly seven round trips between now and march 15 and the airline will give you a free coach ticket anywhere united flies worldwide one small catch on these deals to qualify for the free tickets each flight must cost a minimum of 50 surprised the 50 minimum is in response to a fare war between los angeles and the bay area that has dropped prices to as low as 29 then came the mileage deals alaska airlines reintroduced triple mileage from now through march 15, travelers will earn triple mileage on every alaska flight and twa announced that members of its frequent-flier program will now earn triple miles for any flight taken between jan 7 and feb 7 in an environment of shrinking market share i think this was an attempt to hold market share rather than gain it says charles demoney president and chief executive of mgm grand air earlier this year mgm announced its own two-for-one deal between dec 17 and jan 31, every full-fare passenger flying the upscale airline is entitled to bring along a companion at no cost even the air france concorde is offering deals indirectly air france has announced that between jan 1 and march 31, american express card holders using the card to purchase a round-trip first-class ticket on any air france flight between new york city and paris can reserve a free round-trip seat on the concorde the discounting has also extended to the cruise industry which finds itself awash in empty berths world wide cruises a fort lauderdale-based cruise agency and consolidator is offering very attractive deals on unfilled cabin space for example there's a seven-day caribbean cruise on the meridian for 799, including air fare stopping in antigua st thomas and nassau regular price 1,095 or a seven-day mexican riviera cruise on the dawn princess from los angeles including air fare for 895 regular fare is 1,475 while many resorts and destinations do not officially acknowledge a drop-off in visitors many are beginning to behave in an uncharistic manner they're offering deals most of the deals and discounts aren't being widely advertised but they are there for the asking for example the lodge at vail is offering discount packages although they are not advertised as such one package which offers six days of unlimited skiing hotel accommodations for seven nights and buffet breakfasts daily costs 1,125 945 for nonskiers in london the savoy group of hotels has announced that each room reserved for two nights or more by travelers originating from the united states or canada will include savoy group gift vouchers amounting to nearly 250 the vouchers can be used at any of the group's restaurants or to pay for such incidental charges as telephone and fax bills cocktails tea or even future room nights if you're interested in visiting hawaii florida or the colorado ski slopes don't just ask what the room rates are ask what special packages they might be offering chances are you'll get a more attractive quote hong kong has also become a buyer's market with many upscale hotels beginning to offer discounts but don't look for ads announcing these deals officially most hotels and resorts are advertising their regular prices but the fact is many have occupancy rates significantly below the same period last year thus you may be able to make them an offer they just might not refuse but are these deals really worth it each comes complete with a set of restrictions and disclaimers and for once at least one airline northwest has officially acknowledged in plain english how restricted their program can be within the advertising small print can be found the following statement seats for free travel awards are limited and may not be available when you call popular flights may already be sold out still it gets down to a definition of terms yes each airline limits the number of seats available for free or award travel but there's nothing that says they can't raise the limits if you call to redeem one of your awards and you're told that no seats are available for the awards you should ask if there are seats available for sale if so ask to speak to a supervisor immediately kindly explain that you received this free ticket as a reward for your loyalty and that if you then can't redeem your ticket your loyalty could easily go elsewhere ask the supervisor gently to look once again to see if any seats are available
