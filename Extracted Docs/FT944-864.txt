lo the star which they had seen in the east went before them till it came and stood over where the young child was st matthew chapter 2, verse 9 comet supernova conjunction of planets myth or miracle those broadly speaking are the five favourite explanations for the star of bethlehem an apparition whose identity has attracted much speculation from astronomers amateur and professional over the years of course the atheist who regards the bible as superstitious nonsense can dismiss the star as a figment of the imagination of whoever wrote matthew's gospel at the other extreme the fundamentalist who regards the bible as literal truth can claim the star simply as a miracle if so there is no point in trying to relate a divine sign to known astronomical events however there are many christians who would be prepared to believe that god made use of natural events to give a sign of his son's coming and there are many non-christians who accept that there could be historical though not supernatural explanations for some stories in the bible so what natural phenomena could account for the star of bethlehem anyone who has seen the planet venus shining bright in the western sky on a crisp winter evening may feel that no further explanation is needed but venus could not really be the answer nor could any other regular feature of our night sky surely only a really remarkable portent would have drawn the wise men or magi several hundred miles west to palestine from their presumed homes in persia if we are looking for a special astronomical event we need to know its date as accurately as possible our current system of numbering years supposedly starting from christ's birth was not fixed until the 6 th century ad when the historical record was far from clear modern bible scholars believe that the date of the nativity was somewhere between 8 bc when the emperor augustus ordered his great tax census and 4 bc when king herod died they have no clues about the time of year three or four centuries later people began to celebrate christmas just after the winter solstice to take advantage of existing pagan festivals although no reliable astronomical chronicles survive from the roman empire we do have such records from ancient china they provide no clear evidence that a brilliant new star appeared in the sky between 8 and 4 bc this seems to rule out the most obvious explanation for the star of bethlehem a supernova or gigantic cosmic explosion elsewhere in our galaxy however chinese observers did describe a bright comet which appeared in the spring of 5 bc and remained visible well into the summer a comet with a vertical tail might fit matthew's description of a star that stood over bethlehem although some historians have rejected this theory on the grounds that a comet was usually regarded as an ill omen others maintain that a comet could equally well portend good news in the ancient world a different line of argument moves away from the christmas card image of the star as something spectacularly bright and beautiful after all st matthew tells us that herod his chief priests and scribes failed to notice it until the wise men appeared in jerusalem perhaps the magi saw a more subtle astrological sign this would not have been obvious to the contemporary jewish court which paid little attention to astrology but could have been a powerful portent for the wise men who were probably zoroastrian priests from persia the most likely event of this sort occurred in 7 bc a triple conjunction of the planets jupiter and saturn in the constellation pisces the planets appeared close together in the sky on three occasions during the year most dramatically on september 15 when they rose simultaneously above the horizon at sunset david hughes an astronomer at sheffield university believes that the wise men took this as the moment of christ's birth jupiter was king of the gods saturn represented justice and pisces was the sign of the jews giving the event an astrological potency that is hard to imagine today whatever happened the star is a romantic addition to the christmas story not an essential part of its message but for some astronomers it is the most fascinating mystery in the bible all the better because there is little prospect of anyone ever coming up with a definitive solution
