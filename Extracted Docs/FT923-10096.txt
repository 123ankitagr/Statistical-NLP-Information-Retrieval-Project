ROAD EXPERTS working for the Transport Department are to investigate the claim that building new roads creates traffic growth that would not otherwise take place : the so-called M25 effect . The idea gained credence when traffic growth on the M25 London orbital motorway , completed six years ago , far exceeded forecast levels . Opponents of the roadbuilding programme say the history of the M25 is evidence that government forecasts of road traffic growth are a self-fulfilling prophecy because the Transport Department uses them to justify building new roads . The investigation is being carried out by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment ( Sactra ) , an independent advisory committee . The department said yesterday the committee would study drivers ' responses to road construction or improvement schemes .
