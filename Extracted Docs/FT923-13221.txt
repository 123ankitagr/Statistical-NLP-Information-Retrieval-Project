hypertension is one of the most common causes of heart attacks and strokes it is more serious than high blood pressure it is a silent killer those at risk may be quite unaware of it all adults should know their blood pressure those with chronically high blood pressure have five times the chance of developing heart disease as those with normal blood pressure the ideal pressure is between 9060 and 13080 but what do these numbers mean as it pumps the heart contracts then rests contracts then rests during the contraction phase the pressure generated by the heart is transmitted through the arteries to all organs this pressure wave measured by the first number should be no more than 130 above that level the pressure may be damaging the arteries causing them to lose their elasticity and harden rupture or blockage could result during the relaxation phase the pumping chambers fill with blood for the next volley the second number measures how well the heart is relaxing a reading of more than 80 could mean it is not working properly during this phase although blood pressure tends to creep up with age other things can also raise it overweight leads to high blood pressure as fat is a vascular tissue through which the heart must pump much harder stress also contributes through the release of too much adrenalin while heavy drinking and lack of exercise can make matters worse the good news is that high blood pressure can be controlled with no side effects the first step is proper diagnosis and evaluation the second is treatment through changes in both lifestyle and medication do not decide that you have high blood pressure on the basis of one reading whitecoat hypertension in which the high blood pressure is actually caused by the doctor or nurse is not uncommon for instance you may be active nonsmoking a light drinker lithe and handle stress well but at your annual company check up your blood pressure is 165100 as your lifestyle is already blameless should you be on medication the answer is that any high blood pressure reading should be confirmed by at least two further readings or better still by 24 hour monitoring make sure the measurement is taken after at least five minutes of rest and that you have neither smoked nor drunk alcohol or coffee for at least two hours if your blood pressure is still high an average of at least 14090 buy a wellcalibrated blood pressure machine from the chemist and take your pressure at home under less stressful conditions once you have confirmed beyond question that you really do have high blood pressure ask yourself the following questions do you consume large amounts of salt fat or alcohol have you put on a lot of weight in the last year have you been particularly stressed or sedentary recently is there diabetes in the family if the answer to any of these questions is yes there may be a good reason for the high reading and a change in lifestyle could bring it down many executives are initially annoyed to find their blood pressure is up and later relieved to discover that they were unwittingly placing themselves at risk by getting too fat or drinking too much recent studies have shown that lifestyle changes weight reduction salt restriction and cutting down on alcohol lower blood pressure and make medication more effective if none of these apply other measures to consider include stress management exercise giving up smoking and getting professional advice on your diet the author is the medical director of the insead business health course
