got better she believed people still felt lot better werent looking time reads anecdote relayed recent medical conference reflects challenge facing alzheimers disease researchers physicians for focusing science alone searching cause diagnostic methods treatments isnt enough they must also create commonsense solutions help ease often nightmarish lives patients care and must alert care givers

degenerating nerve cell ends tangles masses twisted filaments accumulate previously healthy nerve cells and yet definitive treatment disorder marked memory loss personality changes communication difficulties time disorientation still number research avenues may ultimately help unlock puzzle while researchers focus origin disease others investigating better diagnostic methods and others zeroing psychosocial aspects research presented recent conference along investigations alzheimers disease research center usc one 10 nia research centers nationwide shed light number areas the longterm debate cause alzheimers disease continues scientists suggesting genetic viral environmental origins combination activation genetic factor probably responsible dr leslie p weiner usc chair neurology professor microbiology told conference participants theres hard evidence viral theory weiner claims fewer researchers today espouse viral theory past read believes the idea viral infection causes brain cell death remains theoretical possibility little experimental evidence said in addition researchers believe different forms disease in study 100 alzheimers patients david freed psychologist staff usc alzheimers disease research center identified three subgroups one subgroup loss nerve cells containing acetylcholine type messenger brain chemical called neurotransmitter basal forebrain another group loss nerve cells norepinephrine another neurotransmitter brain stem may also lack acetylcholine in another subgroup freed found movement changes including tremor rigidity speculates may loss nerve cells containing dopamine this form disease thought result longterm exposure workplace toxins metals solvents freed said another usc researcher dr helena chui associate professor neurology studying plaques form developed two hypotheses something may go awry nerve cells plaque may originate blood vessels the capillaries alzheimers disease patients irregular said in studies autopsied brains found capillary parts plaque another researcher dr carol miller usc associate professor pathology chief neuropathology using molecular probes determine exactly nerve cells affected disease track pattern progression among questions shes investigating does disease identical progression one patient another and healthy nerve cells differ molecular level affected ones meanwhile researchers trying find better diagnostic methods definitive diagnosis alzheimers disease possible experts say biopsy procedure rarely done disease autopsy but several less invasive techniques yielding diagnostic clues well an imaging technique called spect single photon emission computerized tomography best noninvasive procedure making diagnosis alzheimers disease claims dr ismael mena director division nuclear medicine harborucla medical center torrance ucla professor radiological sciences when memory loss presenting symptom mena said spect help determine whether due stroke depression alzheimers in procedure radioactive isotope injected vein hour later image taken brain from computerized brain picture clinician study perfusion blood brains temporal parietal lobes reduced blood flow temporal parietal lobes fingerprint alzheimers disease mena said depression stroke since early 1988 mena used spect 100 alzheimers patients predicts use increase dramatically partly due recent availability new better imaging agents also study diagnostic method computerized electroencephalogram tracing brains electrical activity in healthy people brain waves alpha range predominate wave frequencies dont change much age explained dr cyrus k mody clinical instructor neurology dr hugh mcintrye professor neurology harborucla medical center but alzheimers patients alpha waves decrease replaced slower delta theta waves the computerized eeg technique correctly diagnosed one 50 patients recent study harborucla according researchers the method also evaluate severity say
