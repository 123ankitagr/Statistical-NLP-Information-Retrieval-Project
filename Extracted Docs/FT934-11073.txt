commodity swaps have been with us for nearly 20 years but until three years ago few raw material consumers or producers were actively using swaps to hedge their exposure to changes in commodity prices today the interest in commodity swaps is rapidly gaining momentum but there is still some way to go before this interest is turned into widespread use the total value of deals done is still small the international swaps and derivatives association isda in its first analysis of commodity swaps reckons they were worth at the end of 1992 in notional principal terms of those outstanding dollars 18 bn and of those only dollars 3 bn were non-energy swaps but the market for total interest-rate swaps in the same period was far larger valued at dollars 3,850 bn with currency swaps worth dollars 860 bn still having come from nothing a few years ago the growth in use of commodity swaps is significant they are a useful cost-effective and tailor-made vehicle for users and producers of raw materials to manage their exposure to price risk of an individual commodity in the swap the commodity consumer normally pays fixed and the producer floating protecting the latter from any drop in the commodity's price usually only payment streams are exchanged rather than physical delivery taking place and as the swap is tailored to the particular commodities being used produced the basis risk of using an imperfect substitute say for jet fuel when hedging in the futures market is eliminated but this still does not answer the main reason why the rise in the total value of the commodity swap market has happened now price factor base metal prices have hit six-year lows in recent months this has put a limit on downside risk the cash price for copper currently trades at around dollars 1,675 a tonne near its six-year low when it touched dollars 1,571 and nickel is also at levels not seen since june 1987, when it traded at dollars 4,451 a tonne currently nickel is trading around dollars 4,675 a tonne with base metal prices so depressed there is a fair chance that their next move will be up if i were a consumer i would fix prices now as prices are so low but if something happens these prices would go higher quicker than you know it that's why we're seeing such a lot of activity says robert miller vice-president of commodity risk management at chase manhattan bank in london and since commodity prices have a habit of being highly volatile acutely felt during the gulf war it is good time for raw material consumers who want to capture contango to lock in at current price levels understanding corporate treasurers are becoming increasingly familiar with the use of derivatives to manage their interest rate and currency exposures a survey by greenwich associates a boston-based business strategy consultancy found that 52 per cent of european and middle eastern institutions in early 1993 were hedging their currency exposure by using forwards of less than one year and that 39 per cent used non-dollar interest rate futures or exchange-traded options and says mr per sekse vice-president responsible for commodity derivatives marketing in europe for chemical bank london corporate treasurers seem increasingly willing to deal over-the-counter with the investment banks rather than run their own hedging operations the banks can also offer a wide range of tailor-made services and structures says keith murphy vice-president and head of commodity derivatives at j p morgan london they are looking at very customised products such as indices or baskets of commodities of the very specific exposures that they have the more exotic commodity swaps have tended to be used by heavy energy users to hedge their fuel costs ed speal head of commodity transactions at banque paribas in new york says he has done swaps on specific pipelines for natural gas and different grades of fuel oil also by embedding options into the swap he has been able make an even more attractive and flexible product but for widespread use of the complex vehicles for all raw materials a senior us investment banker says the derivatives industry will get there embedding four or five different risks into the one vehicle within the next year or two you will see the multi-risk swap but the derivatives boffins have never been short on innovation for most corporates however the plain vanilla structures remain the rule of thumb and the majority of commodity swap vehicles tend to be settled against the monthly average price of the raw material these asian or average-rate products are particularly well suited to commodities if an airline is buying jet fuel every day for a year it is not worried by the specific price of the fuel on a specific day but is more concerned by its average price explains mr miller but in the currency markets as i know when apayment is coming in on a particular day i am worried by the exchange rate on that particular day average priced swaps account for virtually all the energy swaps mr miller does and around 75 per cent of metal swaps depth and maturity as the number of banks involved and the amounts of swaps outstanding increase liquidity in commodity swaps has risen and generally spreads have narrowed and with higher liquidity in the market longer-dated vehicles are now being seen commodity hedges on the exchanges a couple of years ago were only going out three to six months forward now in the otc market hedges are extending one two and three years forward and beyond which has had a fundamental impact on the forward curve says mr murphy at j p morgan a strong and active domestic futures market is also important for the banks to lay off their own counterparty risk a liquid futures market is not essential to structure a commodity hedge but if we move away from products that don't have a good underlying futures market then we get into basis risk and our prices have to reflect this says mr sekse at chemical bank and if there are options on the future he she can buy and sell volatility and do his her own delta hedging without fear of getting squeezed but even though commodity swaps can provide a relatively cost-effective and flexible method to hedge raw material prices some corporates are still wary for example mr sekse advised photographic film manufacturers on the benefits of hedging the silver price when prices were low but as soon as prices picked up they quickly saw the new levels as unsustainable and backed-off the hedge expecting the next move in prices to be down mr sekse had more success with frozen orange juice swaps used by fruit juice processing companies the juice processors locked in at a rate of just under dollars 1.00 a lb earlier this year against a price now of around dollars 1.30 a lb but some of the manufacturers wanted to take profits despite having hedged for 1994, believing again the higher price wouldn't be sustained
