THE OUTLOOK for wood pulp was being made worse by the rising value of the New Zealand dollar , Mr Selwyn Cushing , chairman of Carter Holt Harvey , New Zealand 's biggest forestry company , told yesterday 's annual meeting . Low international pulp prices were of concern , but there was more optimism about returns from radiata logs and the group was cutting costs . He said a downward correction in the high prices of radiata pine sawlogs on export markets was inevitable . Radiata pine is the main plantation tree grown in Carter Holt Harvey 's forests in New Zealand and Chile . Prices had risen because of stronger demand from Japan and Korea . Mr Cushing said the company , managed by International Paper of New York , was 'uniquely well positioned to move forward with confidence . ''
