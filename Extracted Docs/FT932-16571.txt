THE first in a series of reforms designed to dismantle the barriers between Japanese banks and securities houses on April 1 fed through to the Eurobond market on Friday , when the London-based securities arms of five Japanese banks launched a spate of deals for Japanese companies . Previously , the banks had not been allowed to lead-manage Japanese corporate or bank issues , except for their parent bank . Among deals totalling Y70bn on Friday , the largest offering was a Y30bn five-year issue for Mitsui & Co , arranged by Sakura Finance International , the London arm of Sakura Bank . Sakura has several corporate deals on the cards for next week . Typically , most Japanese corporate paper in the Euroyen market is , in fact , placed in Japan , and is not actively traded . Japanese companies often prefer to tap the Eurobond market because of the lower fees charged , but the market has nevertheless proved lucrative for underwriters . The move is expected to increase the level of competition in the Euroyen market .
