'' The War of the Roses , '' one of the Christmas season 's first big film releases , had its premiere Monday night at 20th Century Fox studios . The movie , directed by and starring Danny DeVito , with co-stars Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner , screened in two theaters and was followed by a party on the lot . Guests filed through a facade and mock-up of the house featured in the movie , where most of the nasty divorce `` war '' takes place . But only good moods prevailed this night , as well-wishers greeted DeVito and congratulated him on a job well done . The elegant cocktail party atmosphere was carried out with a string quartet playing classical music and food that included champagne and caviar , pasta and desserts . Among the 1,000 people at the party were Michael Douglas and father Kirk ; Turner ; `` War '' producer Jim Brooks ; Chevy Chase ; Marlee Matlin ; Albert Brooks ; Timothy Busfield ; Christian Slater ; Jane Seymour ; Olivia Newton-John ; Courteney Cox ; Arnold Schwarzenegger ; Shirley MacLaine ; Jennifer Tilly ; Lakers coach Pat Riley and DeVito 's wife Rhea Perlman .
