Red Star , British Rail 's express parcels company , was put up for sale for a second time yesterday after a reorganisation intended to make it more attractive to bidders . The company was first offered for sale almost a year ago , but no satisfactory buyer was found and it was taken off the market in December . It has since shed 350 staff , all by voluntary redundancy , and is dropping two of its slower services . Red Star failed to find a buyer because of its large losses - Pounds 9m on turnover of Pounds 43m in 1993 . The streamlining of its operations will not entirely eliminate the loss , it said yesterday . 'The objective is to show a business capable of being developed , ' Red Star said . 'Now we know where we are going . The non-premium services were a millstone around Red Star 's neck . ' Red Star is the only UK parcels carrier to use the British Rail network and has more than 200 outlets , mostly located in or near railway stations . Final bids must be made by July 31 , with the aim of completing a sale by the end of September . Red Star is to concentrate on its same-day service and its 9am and 10.30am next day-services . It will drop from today its noon and 5.30pm next-day services . Red Star is trying to retain its small-volume customers by increasing from Pounds 5 to Pounds 10 the discount for bringing a parcel to the depot . This will apply over the summer . Large-volume customers negotiate individual contracts .
