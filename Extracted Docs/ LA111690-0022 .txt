The Mira Costa mystique claimed another victim Thursday night . Rallying from a game down , the Mustangs recorded their second consecutive upset in the CIF-Southern Section 5-A girls ' volleyball playoffs by defeating second-seeded El Toro , 16-14 , 13-15 , 10-15 , 15-8 , 15-6 , in the semifinals at El Camino College . Even Coach Dae Lea Aldrich appeared startled by the victory . `` I 'm just in shock , '' she said , holding her hand to her forehead . `` It 's not that I do n't believe in them , but they 're just so young . '' Aldrich was referring to her players , who have overcome inexperience and youth to send Mira Costa into the CIF final for the third consecutive season and the seventh time in nine years under Aldrich . The Mustangs ( 20-1 ) will face top-seeded Corona del Mar ( 23-1 ) at 8:15 p.m. Saturday at Cerritos College seeking their second consecutive 5-A title . `` I 'm sitting in awe , '' Aldrich said . `` It was so exciting . '' Outside hitter Cindy DeGarceau led Mira Costa with 22 kills , followed by sophomore middle blocker Tate Medley with 11 and junior hitter Shannon Parke with five . Setter Robin Ortgiesen had 38 assists and sophomore hitter Ann Windes contributed five blocks . El Toro ( 18-4 ) had taken control of the match by winning the third game , but the Chargers appeared to run out of gas late in the match as Mira Costa gained momentum . Aldrich said a turning point occurred late in the fourth game when Michelle Mauney , El Toro 's standout 6-foot-3 middle blocker , appeared to tire . Mauney sat out a good portion of the deciding fifth game . `` ( Mauney ) started tipping instead of hitting in the fourth game , '' Aldrich said . `` I told my team that was our chance because she was getting tired . '' After El Toro took a 6-5 lead in the fifth game , Mira Costa closed out the match with 10 unanswered points . DeGarceau , Medley and Parke each scored two points during the run .
