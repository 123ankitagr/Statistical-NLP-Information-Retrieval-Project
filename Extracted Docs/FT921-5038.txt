THE FILM INDUSTRY is optimistic that Mr Norman Lamont , the chancellor , will announce a tax concession in the Budget on Tuesday to help film production . Mr Lamont said in last year 's Budget that he had studied proposals for tax concessions but could not accept them . He held the door slightly ajar , however , suggesting he would be prepared to consider further proposals . Since then there have been detailed discussions between representatives of the film industry and the Inland Revenue on possible changes to the rules on writing off spending on films . The industry wants accelerated write-offs so that money invested in a film can be written off when the expenditure actually occurs . There are often cashflow difficulties in film production because money is usually spent long before the film is released and starts to repay its investment . The industry is pinning its hopes on changes to the rules on accelerated write-offs because that is the main potential concession for which implications have been explored in detail . Lord Reay , the Department of Trade and Industry minister responsible for the film industry , yesterday praised the skills and talent of British film makers wherever they worked . He said the UK film industry had shown in the past 18 months that it was 'not nearly as dead as it is claimed to be ' . The minister said he could not comment on specific issues so close to the Budget , but he appeared to rule out subsidies which would , he said , merely distort the market . Earlier this week the Labour Party unveiled a series of proposals for the film industry , including the launching of a film initiative to increase investment in British films and the creation of a film investment scheme . That would provide a framework of fiscal measures to encourage and promote private investment .
