THE HEAD of finance and control at Sweden 's Nobel Industries , Mr Jan Kihlberg , resigned from his position yesterday , effectively taking responsibility for the SKr750m ( Dollars 95.5m ) foreign exchange losses which more than halved the group 's 1992 profit to SKr200m . When announced its result earlier this week , Nobel stressed there was no question of unauthorised behaviour , but said human error was partly to blame for the high foreign exchange losses .
