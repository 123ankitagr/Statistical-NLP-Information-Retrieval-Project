President Bush 's approval rating soared to 76 % in the latest Time magazine survey released Sunday . It is the highest popularity rating accorded any President since John F. Kennedy in his first year , Time said . The public rating was a result of what the magazine called `` Peace , Prosperity and Panama . '' However , only 35 % praised his work on the environment and 28 % approved of his actions related to the budget deficit , the poll said . The Time/CNN poll of 500 adult Americans was conducted last week and has a sampling error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
