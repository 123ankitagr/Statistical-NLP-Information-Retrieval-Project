it is lunchtime in hanover square in central london and house of hanover is crowded with tourists filling their shopping carts with walkers shortbread wedgwood china and twinings tea a saleswoman rushes over to a man who has wandered toward a rack of burberrys raincoats excuse me sir those coats are for women she says steering him to the men's side of the department we have many stylish items she exclaims they're very cheap actually she said something more like suimasen sochira wa josei na mono desu kakkoii mono arismasu yo yasui desu yo for house of hanover is not just a run-of-the mill souvenir shop along with several other such stores in london many with familiar japanese department store names it caters almost exclusively for japanese tourists many of the staff in these shops are japanese as are 70 to 99 per cent of their customers the shops carry largely the same range of typical british products but the ethos in the stores is imported from home at igirisu-ya for example formal announcements over the shop sound system thank the shoppers for their patronage in formal japanese and bowing clerks murmuring irasshaimase welcome to our store can be seen in every department shopping is an essential component of a japanese trip abroad and according to the british tourist authority japanese people regularly list good shopping as a reason for coming to london japanese custom dictates that travellers must bring back omiage souvenirs for everyone the japanese are among the most generous spenders to visit england according to british tourist authority figures the japanese spend 16 per cent less time in britain than all other foreign visitors but part with 37 per cent more money although figures have not been compiled for 1993, the bta estimates 580,000 visitors travelled to britain from japan spending around pounds 312 m up 8 per cent from 1992 the number of visitors has grown steadily since 1978 three main tour companies japan travel bureau nippon travel and miki travel serve about 155,000 tourists a year between them they deliver clients to the japanese shops at the end of half-day bus tours sometimes for just 20 frenzied minutes for those whose visits are brief and a two-day stop is common shopping must be squeezed in between sightseeing theatre-going and restaurant hopping the special japanese shops make things easy there are no language barriers they provide vat refund services sogo in piccadilly automatically calculates the refund on the sales receipt and the back of the receipt is a customs form and they accept yen for payment many of the goods in the shops although available in japan are as much as 70 per cent cheaper here but according to noriko mogami assistant manager at takashimaya a lot of japanese have a business-orientated mind and they know a lot about how much things cost as soon as they come into the shop they bring out their calculators and if they think an item is not much cheaper than it is in japan they won't buy it while she spoke a japanese mother and daughter huddled over a pile of ballantyne sweaters punching the prices into their calculators so pounds 40 means y7 000 is that cheaper do you think they murmured at house of hanover manager koichi nagashima said customers were now more choosy he said shodo-gai impulse buying was rare they used to buy things just because they were there now they are careful to buy what they want in recent years japanese tourists have become less content to jump on a bus and be led to house of hanover or takashimaya mogami said that although japanese tourists used the speciality shops almost exclusively 10 to 20 years ago they are now more aware of other more native shopping attractions she said many people were repeat travellers who know where to go and and do not go to japanese shops any more they now go to sloane square kings road covent garden and the markets now we are asked many times how to get to camden or portobello so we are becoming a tourist information centre as more travellers break away from the traditional package tour shoppers will branch out in their shopping habits mami tanaka a university student was travelling for nine days in london with two friends although they went on one bus tour they had been scouting through harrods marks and spencer selfridge's laura ashley and liberty staff at many high street shops frequented by japanese tourists say they considered them good customers they are very polite said miss olga gasson a sales clerk on the ladies rainwear floor at the burberrys regent street store some 42 per cent of burberrys sales come from japanese tourists and the company makes special small sizes for japanese bodies liberty gives out extra bags to japanese customers to use as gift wrap
