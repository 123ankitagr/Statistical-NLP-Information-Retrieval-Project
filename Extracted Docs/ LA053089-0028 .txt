Super star Michael Jackson was one of the few winners present at the Black Radio Exclusive awards show Sunday at the Universal Amphitheater . Jackson accepted an award for outstanding achievement in pop , rock and soul , and his appearance turned out to be the high point of the evening . The big disappointment to the packed house was that hot young star Bobby Brown did n't show up . In fact , the Brown-oriented crowd booed when Karyn White 's `` Superwoman '' was named best song over Brown 's `` My Prerogative . '' Brown was named best male artist , and another no-show , Anita Baker , was picked as best female artist . Two teen favorites -- New Edition ( best group ) and Guy ( best new group ) -- did show up for their awards . Claudia Puig
