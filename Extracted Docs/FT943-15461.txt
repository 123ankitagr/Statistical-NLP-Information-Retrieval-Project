South Korea yesterday agreed to open its market wider to car imports from the EU under the same conditions granted last month to the US . The measures include cutting the tariff on cars to 8 per cent from 10 per cent and replacing a 15 per cent sales tax on cars costing won70m ( Pounds 56,000 ) or more with a 2 per cent tax on all models . Distributors of European cars will also be allowed access to television advertising and more and larger showrooms . The measures are likely to benefit the EU more than the US since most European cars sold in Korea are in the luxury range . The EU exported fewer than 400 cars to Korea last year , while Korea shipped almost 100,000 cars to the EU .
