south korea yesterday agreed to open its market wider to car imports from the eu under the same conditions granted last month to the us the measures include cutting the tariff on cars to 8 per cent from 10 per cent and replacing a 15 per cent sales tax on cars costing won70m pounds 56000 or more with a 2 per cent tax on all models distributors of european cars will also be allowed access to television advertising and more and larger showrooms the measures are likely to benefit the eu more than the us since most european cars sold in korea are in the luxury range the eu exported fewer than 400 cars to korea last year while korea shipped almost 100000 cars to the eu
