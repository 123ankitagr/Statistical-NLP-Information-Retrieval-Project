X-rays on inside linebacker Frank Stams ' injured right knee revealed some ligament damage , and he will miss the rest of the season . But Stams , who hurt the knee in the first half of Monday night 's loss to the San Francisco 49ers , appears to have escaped serious injury , Coach John Robinson said Tuesday . Robinson said Bruce Klostermann will play at Stams ' spot . Tight end Damone Johnson , who reinjured his hamstring , and guard Tom Newberry , who sprained his left ankle . Robinson said both look doubtful for Sunday 's game at Atlanta . Robinson said that he plans to play both Gaston Green and Cleveland Gary at tailback in the remaining two games of 1990 , but that he was n't sure who would be the starter . Robinson also said that No . 1 pick Bern Brostek , who played left guard after Newberry went down , did an adequate job . TIM KAWAKAMI
