simon crane spends his days looking out for abandoned babies shooting stars flags pennants crows and candlesticks mr crane is a chart analyst one of the much-maligned but now indispensable technical observers of foreign exchange movements the flags babies and stars are different ways of describing the lines he puts on paper yet mr crane is anxious to avoid colourful language it creates confusion over what chartists are about he says in mr crane's words forex chartists aim to show where the risk or profit on a particular currency lies within a given period and where the market is at that particular time the market is a big playing field he says everyone knows where the ball is and where the goalposts are what they do not know is where the pitch is or just where the boundaries are the key to drawing charts is past performance with a monotonous regularity the same picture occurs says mr crane using a measurement of performance the chartist aims to make a projection about what might happen in the future he says critics of charts who disparagingly refer to the discipline as the autopilot approach would hold that mr crane's job takes little account of the unquantifiable factors such as politics and sentiment affecting exchange rates mr crane argues no chartist would ignore such factors at the end of the day you are analysing the psychology and dynamics of the market he says there is no scientific method of interpreting charts however there is one golden rule and that is the market is always right such a rule applies as much to fundamentalists as to chartists he says and each faction would be wrong to ignore the other differences of opinion merely fuel mr crane's enthusiasm he maintains that among the 25 banks and corporations which his company crane investment analysis cia lists as clients there are a healthy number who disagree with what he says yet they still come back because most traders will not ignore the risk parameters as defined by detailed charts we define where the resistance is where the support is and make a judgment as to how much pace is behind the current move on a given day mr crane could work with hundreds of charts the aptly-named cia mr crane keeps his methods secret even from close friends deals also with the precious metals capital markets and equity markets however the bulk of his analysis deals with currencies and capital markets to the sceptics mr crane says charting is likely to become an increasingly important tool for foreign exchange trading technical analysis is essential he says in a market place where a large percentage of any given currency move occurs over increasingly shorter time frames and in a market worth some dollars 700 bn a day and growing according to his own calculations traders will find it more and more difficult to ignore any help they can get
