how much you are prepared to contribute maximising your pension is important but other commitments such as mortgages require a share of your income this leads to a central problem in pension planning the time when you could gain the most growth from an investment below the age of 50 is also when you are least able to save simon philip of chantrey financial services suggests it is best while you still have heavy commitments to set a small proportion of your income for avcs and stick to it as a form of selfdiscipline if you are not able to say goodbye to the money until you retire do not put it in an avc how great a pension are you aiming to achieve inflation makes this a hard question to answer and virtually any pension illustration can mislead in some way but some calculations help family assurance a friendly society has launched a pensions guidance service which provides quotations on the level of avcs you will need to deliver the pension you want it does this by assessing the pension rights you have accrued in your company scheme and converting this into a regular pension in todays money it then calculates the amount you would need to pay in avcs to make this figure up to the pension you are aiming for the service is free although family does take the opportunity to recommend its own fsavc contract which is called freestand this makes it easier to work out how much you should contribute remember illustrations must make assumptions about the rate of growth of your avc and about inflation also with luck your salary will rise before you retire how good is your inhouse scheme staying with your inhouse avc will give you a quieter life and should cost you less than an fsavc you therefore need to be unhappy with their arrangements before you opt for an fsavc according to simon philip there are two main advantages you could achieve with a freestanding avc diversification and improved investment performance he suggests that if you have amassed more than pounds 50000 in the company scheme taking out a separate avc might be good just for the diversification it would bring if the inhouse scheme offers a poor choice and some only offer one building society account then an fsavc looks better but some inhouse avcs offer a wide range of funds and allow free transfers between them what is your tax position brian symonds of sun life points out that toprate taxpayers have a stronger incentive to stay with an inhouse scheme claiming toprate tax relief is easier and quicker this way and can be done immediately while you have to claim relief via your annual tax return for an fsavc will you stay with your current company until you retire if not the portability of an fsavc grows more appealing you could treat an fsavc as a personal pension and continue making contributions even if you became selfemployed says symonds if you are considering early retirement but do not want your bosses to know this an fsavc could make sense sudden heavy donations into an inhouse avc might raise questions which you could avoid by using an fsavc which freestanding avc is the best for you valid performance statistics are not available as avcs are longterm investments and the longestlived policies have been going for less than five years the best you can do is choose a group whose unitlinked or withprofits performance in other funds is strong but you can find out what the charges are on unitlinked and unitised withprofits avcs a 5 per cent bidoffer spread and 1 per cent annual charges are typical keep your charges low also avoid avcs which restrict your ability to shop around for an annuity when you retire
