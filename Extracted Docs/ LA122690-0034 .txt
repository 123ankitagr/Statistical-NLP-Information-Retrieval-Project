British air commanders believe that if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf , a massive initial air strike against Iraqi positions would give allied forces air superiority and could even bring victory without involving ground troops . Under the right circumstances , the allied air forces could win a war without using the army for the first time in history , said Air Vice Marshal Bill Wratten , deputy commander of Britain 's gulf forces . Britain 's contribution to the allied air offensive plan is the Tornado warplane , equipped with JP 233 bombs . The JP 233 bomb , which blows craters in airfield runways and showers hundreds of `` bomblets '' to prevent ground crews from clearing the damage , is seen as crucial in keeping Iraqi warplanes out of the fighting . British air chiefs say an Iraqi air base could be closed for up to 36 hours after a JP 233 attack . The Tornadoes are expected to form part of mixed groups of allied aircraft sent into the attack . The pilots of the sand-colored Tornadoes based at Bahrain 's Muharraq air base hone their skills at practice ranges in the Saudi Arabian desert . They train to fly at 100 feet altitude and at a speed of 600 m.p.h . The Tornadoes and a squadron of Jaguars also based at Muharraq are training for day and night operations as the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15 approaches for Iraq to leave Kuwait . The base commander , Group Capt . David Henderson , said he believes that initial air superiority could be won within hours and full control of the skies secured in days .
