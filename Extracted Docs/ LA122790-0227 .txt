Officials in the town where Alice Walker was born want to build a trail honoring the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of `` The Color Purple . '' Walker , 46 , is honored in Eatonton only with a street named for her and with books on display at the Chamber of Commerce . Organizers of The Color Purple Educational Fund Foundation , which helps needy students , want to create a trail passing Walker 's birthplace , her mother 's home and the cemetery where her father and other relatives are buried . Plans also call for erecting a monument in the courthouse square . `` I wish we had a museum , '' said City Councilman Ulysses Rice . Other works by Walker include `` You Ca n't Keep a Good Woman Down , '' `` I Love Myself When I 'm Laughing '' and `` Meridian . ''
