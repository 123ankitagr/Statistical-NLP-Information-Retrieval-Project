Michael Hawker , who resigned as managing director of mail order company Freemans last July , is joining rival Empire Stores as managing director later this year . Hawker was with Freemans for 13 years but left after Sears group chief executive Liam Strong decided a shake-up of management was needed to boost profits growth . He will work with current managing director Jean-Baptiste Tefra as a part-time consultant before taking over later this year . Tefra is returning to parent group La Redoute , the French mail order group which acquired Empire in May 1991 , although Empire says he will retain active links with the company . Hawker faces the challenge of returning Empire , the UK 's fifth largest mail order company with a 6 per cent market share , to profits after four years of losses .
