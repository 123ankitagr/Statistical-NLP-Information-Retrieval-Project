british airways has announced two new programs for the mature traveler age 60 and over one is a comprehensive membership program with discounts and many other advantages the other a basic senior economyclass fare to london both are good and wellintended but the joint announcement has caused confusion that will take some weighing of options and restrictions as to which is best the airlines privileged traveler program offers free membership and provides 10 savings on all air fares between the united states and great britain from advance purchase economy to firstclass even for flights on the concorde there are other advantages and services more on those later the 10 discount is not applicable to the new low senior fare that is open to all mature travelers age 60 and over and does not require membership another major factor to consider is that the membership program includes a waiver on all penalties for pretrip cancellations or changes of reservations on any flights except the new senior fares savings and restrictions the complications come with the airlines new senior fares which provide up to 30 off the normal apex fare they provide bigger savings than the 10 discount but have some major restrictions to wit the regular 21day advance purchase economy roundtrip west coast fare to london is $ 698 privileged traveler members would get 10 off or $ 629 and no restrictions and a waiver on penalties bas new senior fare on the same route is a 14day advance purchase economy round trip of just $ 549 on the same route probably even the same plane that rate will be available only through march when it will still be discounted but less so the $ 549 fare has restrictions the biggest being a $ 75 charge if the ticket is canceled or changed during the 14day period this can be returned upon proof of illness from a doctor it is also limited to travel to london sunday through wednesday returning monday through thursday again the privileged traveler discounted $ 629 fare has no such restriction one other point both the new senior fare and the privileged traveler program allow the passenger to take along a companion 50 or older at the same price as long as they travel on the same itinerary this doubles the pleasure but also doubles the possibilities of penalties if one or the other has to cancel or change plans using the lower $ 549 fare your travel agent can explain finer points about taking out cancellation insurance and whether the saving from the lower fare could be wiped out by requiring an extra days hotel stay to join a tour in any case the mature traveler would be wise to sign up for the preferred traveler program anyway it is free before april 30 even then applications or membership renewals of $ 10 will be waived if the member flies on british airways during the life of the card listing advantages in addition to the 10 acrosstheboard savings on all ba air fares to great britain for the member and companion and the waiver on penalties for pretrip cancellations or changes other advantages include a 10 saving on hundreds of land arrangements offered in british airways 130page holidays london plus brochure including evening tours of london theater sightseeing and hotels plus two to fourday excursions through great britain and longer tours of europe similar 10 discounts on the venicesimplon orient express and selected sailings on cunard cruises aboard the vistafjord and qe 2 preferred travelers will be able to check in at the airlines club class windows rather than the longerwait economy class checkin get a membership card and be in bas computer files for meal preferences seats and medical assistance and have access to a special phone number for ba reservations and information preferred traveler brochures applications and more information can be obtained through travel agents or by calling british airways tollfree at 800 airways
