RECORD BREAKER : The murder trial of Thomas Maniscalco , which went to the jury six weeks ago , is setting longevity records in Orange County criminal courts . . . . At 16 months , the trial is already the longest criminal proceeding in county history -- so long that the judge had to suspend deliberations for two weeks to honor jurors ' prepaid vacations . If found guilty , the biker-lawyer faces a possible death sentence in connection with a 1980 triple murder in Westminster . The penalty phase of the trial could stretch into next year .
