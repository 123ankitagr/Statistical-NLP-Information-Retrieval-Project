as father christmas harnesses his reindeer on christmas eve retailers up and down the land will be counting their seasonal takings christmas is the vital trading period for most non-food retailers in the uk and some make as much as 90 per cent of their annual profits at this time christmas makes or breaks the bottom line for almost every retailer says mr john richards retail analyst at county natwest woodmac five years after retailers first began talking about recession this year's concern that some troubled retailers could fail if christmas is poor is likely to prove unfounded most large chains have already taken the necessary actions the likes of next burton and storehouse have seen their share prices soar this year a question mark does hang over ratners the jewellery group particularly after the recent sudden resignation of its chief executive small independent retailers are less likely to have built up the unwieldy cost structures that have caused headaches for the large chains stores in some sectors such as do-it-yourself are not heavily dependent on christmas trade this christmas will be scrutinised for signs of recovery in consumer spending yet however low the level of consumer confidence a build-up in sales in the weeks leading up to christmas is guaranteed as the chart of retail sales shows in bhs the storehouse chain store subsidiary sales in the peak christmas trading week are around three times those of the lowest week of the year and even a bad christmas would have a ratio close to that at argos the catalogue store retailer the five weeks before christmas provide about a quarter of the year's volume of sales mr bob stewart finance director says the difference between a good and bad christmas is only a few percentage points in volume terms mr richards says curiously there has not been a bad christmas in recent years last year there was a lot of discounting but there is never an enormous drop in volume the essential question for retailers is whether the high level of sales will translate into high profits argos's quarter of annual sales usually translates into about two-thirds of annual profits for ratners christmas has represented as much as 90 per cent of annual profits in past years and woolworths part of the kingfisher group makes its entire annual profit between october and january even a chain such as boots the chemist which sells everyday items bought all year round makes around half its year's profits in the christmas selling period with w h smith the newsagent and stationer making a third sales made at christmas are highly profitable because of the operational gearing effect of the high fixed overheads in retailing as the table shows the peak week's sales produce a much higher net profit margin on the same gross margin as fixed overheads are spread equally over the year although there are some extra costs in the christmas period such as staffing the net margin is much higher every extra transaction makes a higher net margin until as mr stanley kalms chairman of dixons the electrical retailer says by christmas eve the gross margin comes through to the net profits depend though on the gross margin being held mr robert shrager finance director of dixons says christmas is really a matter of expectations versus reality if you expect it to be bad and it is bad than that's not bad but if you expect it to be good and it's bad that's bad if retailers build stocks for christmas and find they are not selling they will sacrifice margins one way or another this year they appear to have been cautious about stock levels in recent christmases retailers have resorted to price cutting to shift stock that cuts into margins making the period less profitable than it should have been last year there was a general dip in sales in november and by the start of december the discounting was well under way including the now infamous ploy by ratners to cut prices by 25 per cent on saturdays this year discounting activity appears to be more selective most shops will open on the last three or four sundays before christmas this year although marks and spencer and john lewis have taken a principled stand against the trend marks and spencer shops are opening long hours on the other days though with some in shopping centres staying open until 10 pm
