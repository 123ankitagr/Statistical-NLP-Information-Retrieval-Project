ever since the blue letters spelling columbia studios appeared on the gates of the former mgm lot last month hollywood has been rife with speculation about sony corps supposedly grand plans for the property at least a few things are clear yes sonys columbia pictures unit envisions some fancy new buildings on the culver city movie lot that it acquired from time warner inc sooner or later no batman set designer anton furst doesnt have a secret plan to remake the lots famous thalberg building erected back when metrogoldwynmayer still owned the property but he says hes willing to come up with one as for rumors that columbias freewheeling cochairmen peter guber and jon peters plan to buy a former mortuary next to the studios front gate and turn it into a koi pond or to collect old columbia movie sets for a minitheme park somewhere a kind of sonyland in sunland as one intimate of the pair put it nobody as yet is willing to say were in the conceptualization stage said columbias filmed entertainment president alan levine who has remained tightlipped about precise plans for the culver city lot im faced with trying to temper my excitement about this when its all over were going to have the showcase of the west side as far as im concerned under an extraordinary settlement of guberpeters movie production contract with warner sonycolumbia received the culver city lot in exchange for columbias 35 of the burbank studios which the two companies had jointly inhabited since 1971 warner had acquired the mgm lot when it merged with lorimartelepictures in early 1989 lorimar in turn had bought the lot in 1986 from turner broadcasting system which purchased it that same year from mgmua entertainment co in a touch of theateroftheabsurd a successor company to mgmua simultaneously moved the studios giant leo the lion sign across the street where it now perches atop filmland corporate center columbia insiders estimate that about 1500 employees will move to culver city from burbank over the next few months even as hundreds of warner employees make the reverse trek to burbank levine said it is too early to know exactly how many employees will move or when for the foreseeable future he said at least some columbia units will remain in the studio plaza building an adjunct to the burbank lot that still belongs to cocacola which sold columbia to sony last year other columbia employees will be transferred to the west coast from new york although a skeleton staff will remain in the east eventually the studios operations are likely to be consolidated on the tightly built 44acre culver city site where levine foresees a lot of work and several new buildings none of which has yet been planned according to published reports the ebullient peters has tried to lure executives and producers to columbia with promises that their offices would be designed by furst whose gotham city sets for batman won him an academy award nomination last week reached in new york where hes been working on designs for columbias awakenings furst said peters has asked him to get in touch regarding some big schemes for the lot but the two have never had a detailed conversation about it i dont know what the scale of the job is furst said i think peters would like to make it somehow representative of the movie industry but ive never even seen the thalberg building however those plans develop major change isnt likely to be easy or cheap culver city already known for a somewhat restrictive attitude toward development is considering a pair of ballot propositions that would further control growth including one that would limit any new building in the city to a height of 56 feet meanwhile the lots massive rooftop sign which still reads lorimar studios is already a protected landmark under culver city law the wording can change but only within limits and other buildings on the 75yearold movie lot are being reviewed for possible historical preservation founded by movie industry pioneer thomas ince the studio housed the samuel goldwyn co before formation of metrogoldwynmayer under a requirement that dates to warners ownership moreover columbia is supposed to present the city with a detailed schedule for submitting a master plan for the lot by the end of march or interim improvements could be held up the issue of parking needs to be addressed said culver citys development director jody esser things need to be remodeled weve all been very concerned about the age and usefulness of some buildings it would be normal for culver city not to permit one small building or area to be addressed esser said we would want a master plan to show what will be the final result warners lorimar unit which filmed such tv shows as falcon crest and perfect strangers at culver city and will continue to rent some sound stages from columbia spent about $ 20 million to refurbish facilities and bring the aging thalberg office building into compliance with the citys health and safety codes the architecture firm of gensler associates is now helping prepare the graceful white office building for columbias arrival but hasnt undertaken major modifications one person familiar with the lot said it is generally in good shape despite cracked plaster and peeling paint on many of its drab beige structures but he added that its underground utilities may need extensive replacement at a cost of $ 20 million or more an issue that columbia hasnt investigated according to levine on the home front the pending move from burbank has already triggered grumbling at columbia where some employees who live in the san fernando valley arent charmed by their lengthening commute i think youll find that people from the junior executive level on down are unhappy said one columbia employee who declined to be identified the company has responded to complaints the way studios always respond this is the movie business there are a hundred people in line for your job still several union officials who represent columbia workers at burbank say they havent heard serious complaints from members we may hear more down the line said a spokesman for office and professional workers local 174 which represents over 400 columbia employees but right now there is no prevalent voice of complaint we have people living on both sides levine declined to comment on the sonyland talk or on any plans to acquire property outside the lot although it appears clear from other sources that columbia may have its hands full if it is really planning a japanesestyle pond for koi or carp at the studio gate oscar hardison a louisiana investor whose filmcorp properties i bought the former mortuary that adjoins the lots madison avenue entrance for $ 550000 in 1984 said he might be willing to sell though almost certainly for more than the $ 900000 offer he said he received for it two years ago but harvey seymour a selfdescribed innovator who leases the property and is working on a product that will affect both the entertainment and the produce industries said columbia officers had better think twice about trying to move him if jon peters said he wants the property hed better run like a turkey said seymour you just dont go around displacing people because youre a young genius
