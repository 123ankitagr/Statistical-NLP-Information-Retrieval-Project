Svensson will play Prpic in the first singles match today , and Wilander will complete the best-of-five series against Ivanisevic , a teen-ager who has jumped to 51st in the rankings this year . The Yugoslavs were playing only their fourth doubles match together . Ivanisevic , who played two other doubles with Prpic in the Kings Cup , a European team event , and one in the Nations ' Cup , was outstanding . `` It was a tough match because we have played so little together , '' Ivanisevic said . `` We played really good . It was impossible to beat us . Edberg , a finalist in both the French Open and Wimbledon , was replaced as singles player by Svensson because of an ankle injury . He had not played competitively since Wimbledon .
