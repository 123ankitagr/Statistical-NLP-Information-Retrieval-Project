With apologies to David Letterman and WGN-TV Chicago , here 's my sports list of things I do n't know : 10 . How Vin Scully , all by himself , can describe a game on the radio , and yet ABC needs three guys to explain a game we 're watching on TV . 9 . Why Harry Caray describes every fly ball as a `` high '' fly ball . 8 . Why all major leaguers , even rookies , wear gold chains on the field . 7 . Why Harry Caray describes every pop-up as a `` high '' pop-up . 6 . How Pee Wee Reese got into the Hall of Fame with 2,170 hits and a .269 batting average . 5 . Why Harry Caray , after 40 years in broadcasting , still ca n't pronounce Hispanic names . 4 . Why Vada Pinson , with 2,757 hits and a .286 average , is n't in the Hall of Fame . 3 . Why Harry Caray ca n't say Chris Sabo 's last name . 2 . Why the Atlanta Braves are in the Western Division and the Atlanta Hawks are in the Eastern Conference . 1 . Why the baseball commissioner lets managers dress up in players ' clothes . DAVID MACARAY , Rowland Heights
