In response to `` Katz Tries Going With L.A. River 's Flow , '' by Bella Stumbo , Part A , Oct. 15 : Assemblyman Richard Katz ( D-Sylmar ) should be commended for trying to be creative in thinking up solutions to Los Angeles freeway congestion . However , the last thing the people of Los Angeles need is to lose some of the little open space they have left for a freeway where there once was a river . There are still stretches of the Los Angeles River which act as a river should and provide a haven for birds , top soil for shrubs , and in times of heavy rainfall rapid waters . There are equestrian trails for horseback enthusiasts . People who live in neighborhoods which abut the Los Angeles River and who are already plagued by monstrous street traffic would be expected to endure an even greater traffic nightmare by having their surface roads overloaded back-to-back , acting as vehicular arteries to the Los Angeles River Freeway . Also , in view of the damage done in the recent Bay Area earthquake , the safety of a freeway constructed on a riverbed is problematic . Katz has worked on a number of good proposals to cure Los Angeles traffic problems ; the recent compromise legislation involving relaxation of the Gann spending limit as it relates to transportation needs is the latest example . I hope he concentrates on those efforts and puts to rest the Los Angeles River Freeway . DAVID ROBERTI President Pro Tempore California State Senate D-Los Angeles
