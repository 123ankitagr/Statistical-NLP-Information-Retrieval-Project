it's time time again you know what i'm sayin crowed morris day the breezy preening hipster who personifies the swagger and rollicking spirit of the time's funky r b music what he was really saying is that the time after an untimely split seven years ago has reunited day spent the good part of a late-afternoon interview boasting about the group's new album pandemonium which has gotten rave reviews arguably the best funk band of the 80 s the time is now the best funk band of the 90 s so far anyway with a recent top 20 album and a top 10 single jerk out not only that the time has four songs on graffiti bridge the sound-track album from prince's movie which is due for release in the fall the time is also featured in the film a sequel to 1984's purple rain a minneapolis-based band that prince boosted to prominence in the early 80 s the time also features keyboardist jimmy jam harris bassist terry lewis singer jerome benton keyboardist monte moir drummer jellybean johnson and guitarist jesse johnson when the time split up on the heels of the success of purple rain the band seemed on the verge of superstardom a major factor was jesse johnson's and day's succumbing to the lure of solo stardom ironically since the split harris and lewis who formed a producing songwriting team during their time tenure have been the most successful masterminding janet jackson's last two hit albums though jesse johnson did three albums on a m records he has never become a major star benton has been dabbling with mild success in music and films as a session musician jellybean johnson is a major cog in the harris-lewis production team moir's biggest credit is working as a producer writer with that team but after making such a vivid impression as the droll rogue in purple rain day seemed the most likely to become a big star as a singer or actor or maybe both but his two albums were just modest hits he has had featured roles in tv sitcoms that never made it big including new attitude which was made for abc his most recent movie role was in the adventures of ford fairlane a part that he downgrades as a minor part in a bad movie so it's obvious that day's reason for doing the time album was to boost his career right that's jive day said i did this project so i could work with my buddies again i have a lot of projects to work on i like working in the time but i don't need the time i'm not desperate neither he added are any of the other members especially harris and lewis for that pair part of the fun of the reunion is the chance to be musicians again for a change like day they also wanted a chance to re-establish the camaraderie they enjoyed in the old days also harris added in a separate interview the time represented unfinished business a sentiment echoed by day everybody had a feeling that the band ended prematurely that there were still some good years left in the band if we could ever put it back together day said a prelude to this reunion was a brief get-together in 1987 to play an awards show in minnesota it wasn't an official reunion because monte didn't play harris said but it felt good playing together again we all knew it was something we wanted to do when the time was right originally harris said the time had planned to make its own movie with a cameo appearance by prince but then prince came to us about doing a movie a prince movie with an appearance by the time harris recalled we wound up doing it his way he was persuasive on one important level the road to the reunion was smooth there were no hostilities between members harris said if some people hated each other we would have never even thought about a reunion we got along together and we stayed in touch
