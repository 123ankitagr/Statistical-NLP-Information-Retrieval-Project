'' It 's Time time again -- you know what I 'm sayin ' , '' crowed Morris Day , the breezy , preening hipster who personifies the swagger and rollicking spirit of the Time 's funky R & B music . What he was really saying is that the Time , after an untimely split seven years ago , has reunited . Day spent the good part of a late-afternoon interview boasting about the group 's new album `` Pandemonium , '' which has gotten rave reviews . Arguably the best funk band of the '80s , the Time is now the best funk band of the '90s -- so far anyway -- with a recent Top 20 album and a Top 10 single , `` Jerk Out . '' Not only that , the Time has four songs on `` Graffiti Bridge , '' the sound-track album from Prince 's movie , which is due for release in the fall . The Time is also featured in the film , a sequel to 1984 's `` Purple Rain . '' A Minneapolis-based band that Prince boosted to prominence in the early '80s , the Time also features keyboardist Jimmy ( Jam ) Harris , bassist Terry Lewis , singer Jerome Benton , keyboardist Monte Moir , drummer Jellybean Johnson and guitarist Jesse Johnson . When the Time split up -- on the heels of the success of `` Purple Rain '' -- the band seemed on the verge of superstardom . A major factor was Jesse Johnson 's and Day 's succumbing to the lure of solo stardom . Ironically , since the split , Harris and Lewis , who formed a producing/songwriting team during their Time tenure , have been the most successful , masterminding Janet Jackson 's last two hit albums . Though Jesse Johnson did three albums on A & M Records , he has never become a major star . Benton has been dabbling , with mild success , in music and films . As a session musician , Jellybean Johnson is a major cog in the Harris-Lewis production team . Moir 's biggest credit is working as a producer/writer with that team . But after making such a vivid impression as the droll rogue in `` Purple Rain , '' Day seemed the most likely to become a big star -- as a singer or actor , or maybe both . But his two albums were just modest hits . He has had featured roles in TV sitcoms that never made it big -- including `` New Attitude , '' which was made for ABC . His most recent movie role was in `` The Adventures of Ford Fairlane , '' a part that he downgrades as `` a minor part in a bad movie . '' So it 's obvious that Day 's reason for doing the Time album was to boost his career . Right ? `` That 's jive , '' Day said . `` I did this project so I could work with my buddies again . I have a lot of projects to work on . I like working in the Time but I do n't need the Time . I 'm not desperate . '' Neither , he added , are any of the other members -- especially Harris and Lewis . For that pair , part of the fun of the reunion is the chance to be musicians again for a change . Like Day , they also wanted a chance to re-establish the camaraderie they enjoyed in the old days . Also , Harris added in a separate interview , the Time represented unfinished business -- a sentiment echoed by Day . `` Everybody had a feeling that the band ended prematurely , that there were still some good years left in the band -- if we could ever put it back together , '' Day said . A prelude to this reunion was a brief get-together in 1987 to play an awards show in Minnesota . `` It was n't an official reunion because Monte did n't play , '' Harris said . `` But it felt good playing together again . We all knew it was something we wanted to do when the time was right . '' Originally , Harris said , the Time had planned to make its own movie , with a cameo appearance by Prince . `` But then Prince came to us about doing a movie -- a Prince movie with an appearance by the Time , '' Harris recalled . `` We wound up doing it his way . He was persuasive . '' On one important level , the road to the reunion was smooth . `` There were no hostilities between members , '' Harris said . `` If some people hated each other we would have never even thought about a reunion . We got along together and we stayed in touch . ''
