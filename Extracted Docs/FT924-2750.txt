France 's central bank yesterday announced a slight easing of its money supply target for next year , to take account of an expected small pick-up in economic growth , writes William Dawkins in Paris . The new range for growth of the M3 measure of broad money will be between 4 per cent and 6.5 per cent , said Mr Jacques de Larosiere , governor of the Banque de France . M3 is set to grow by 6 per cent , right at the top of its 4 per cent to 6 per cent target for 1992 , which Mr de Larosiere attributed to a rise in savings . He stressed that the central policy objectives would continue to be to defend the franc 's stability and to control inflation , but that enlargement of the M3 target was justified to give 'every chance ' for an economic recovery .
