Ryan McGuire of El Camino Real High , who helped lead an area team to the American Legion World Series title last summer , has orally committed to play baseball at UCLA . McGuire , a left-handed first baseman-pitcher , had narrowed his choices to Stanford and UCLA . McGuire said he will sign a letter of intent April 11 , the first day of the baseball signing period . McGuire , 6-foot-2 , 185 pounds , said he was offered a partial scholarship from Stanford and a full scholarship from UCLA . The Bruins ' 10-1 start made the decision easier . UCLA is ranked 15th by Baseball America . `` I felt all along that the program would be on the rise , '' said McGuire , whose father , Ken , works in the UCLA athletic department . `` The 10-1 start confirmed it . `` Another big issue was that Stanford has so many great athletes that I probably would n't be able to break into the lineup for a couple of years . At UCLA , I should be able to play at first base and pitch some , even in my first year . '' After batting .397 at El Camino Real two seasons ago , McGuire was selected Cal-Hi Sports ' sophomore Player of the Year . Last summer , McGuire played on the Woodland Hills West American Legion team , which became the first entry from Valley-based District 20 to win a World Series title . During the Legion regular season , district and area playoffs , McGuire batted .416 with five home runs and 30 runs batted in for West , which finished 38-7 . He was was selected the most valuable player in the state tournament in Yountville , Calif. , after hitting four home runs and driving in 12 runs .
