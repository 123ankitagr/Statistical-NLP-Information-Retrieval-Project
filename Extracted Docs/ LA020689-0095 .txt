chris jackson has never sought glory on the basketball court only success all he asks for is a winning season maybe a conference championship a playoff berth sure why not success drove jackson at mater dei high school and the lack of it drove him from uc santa barbara this desire for winning led jackson to uc riverside after playing one year at rancho santiago college where of course he had success i dont expect everything to turn our rosy all the time i just want to win jackson said its a terrible day when you lose jackson has found plenty of success since he came to riverside in the fall of 1987 the highlanders were 228 last season and are 172 this year the times have been good and so has jackson possibly jacksons greatest moment came on christmas day which he thought was going to be one of those terrible days riverside had to face iowa in the championship game of the chaminade christmas tournament in hawaii thats right iowa from the big time and big ten fourthranked iowa no one needed a caucus to predict the outcome of this one they were joking around smiling and laughing during warmups jackson said i dont think they were taking us seriously well the last laugh was on the hawkeyes riverside a division ii team from the california collegiate athletic assn upset the hawkeyes 11092 the highlanders set a national collegiate athletic assn record by making 21 of 36 threepoint shots jackson a 6foot4 senior contributed 12 points while being guarded by roy marble an allbig ten selection a year ago it wasnt exactly a scoring onslaught but jackson did hit some key baskets at one point in the second half the hawkeyes were making a run with the 45second shot clock winding down jackson got the ball behind the threepoint line the national basketball assn threepoint line and sank a shot to beat the clock marble looked at me and said that was luck jackson said the next time down i went into the corner and made another threepointer marble looked at me and shook his head that still gets me pumped up we were little riverside before now were big riverside big or little jackson is at riverside for just one reason success and he hasnt been disappointed because the highlanders are ranked no 1 in the ncaa division ii poll honestly i didnt think we had a chance at chris riverside coach john masi said i thought he was a little above our program there were so many division i schools interested in him the trek that landed jackson in riverside began at the long beach arena in march of 1980 jackson an eighthgrader was sitting in the rafters with his friend mike fielder they watched in awe as inglewood defeated long beach poly 5246 for the southern section major division championship we were watching inglewood celebrating jackson said mike and i decided right then that some day we were going to be the ones on the court celebrating but in his dream jackson wasnt wearing a mater dei jersey at that time the monarchs had yet to win a southern section title and were considered just another good basketball school when ray alvarado jacksons traveling team coach told him about mater dei it didnt really mean much he was already set on attending la quinta with his friends the matter might have died had not alvarado told john jackson chris father about the monarchs program my parents had always wanted to send their kids to a private high school said jackson the youngest of seven children but they never had the means to do it until it was my turn to go to high school my dad got it in his mind that mater dei was where i would go jackson wasnt so sure i had the vision that catholic schools were strict he said you had to go to church all the time and there were a bunch of nuns running around with rulers all through the summer jackson pleaded with his parents not to force him to attend mater dei finally the night before school was to start his parents relented and said he didnt have to if he didnt want to by then it was too late i already had my clothes and books jackson said i was going to mater dei the monarchs were moderately successful in jacksons sophomore season they qualified for the southern section 4a playoffs and reached the quarterfinals the next season gary mcknight replaced bill alexander as coach mater dei went on to win the first of its five southern section championships jackson wasnt the star but he was a key component a little scoring a little rebounding a little defense i never wanted to be a star i just wanted the team to win he said it did in 198283 the monarchs defeated long beach poly in the final 6244 at the long beach arena where jackson and mater dei teammate fielder had sat in the rafters three years before we were celebrating after the game and mike and i looked and at the same time we said remember jackson said the monarchs finished 293 in 198384 but lost in the championship game to long beach poly by this time college recruiters were making regular visits to mater dei as they coveted the likes of tom lewis 67 matt beeuwsaert 66 and mike mitchell 65 as well as jackson and fielder 64 all would receive scholarships to division i schools i think my senior year was the first time i really took basketball seriously jackson said i not only wanted a scholarship i wanted to go to a divisioni school jackson accepted an offer from jerry pimm the firstyear coach at uc santa barbara at first jackson was happy with his choice pimm was grooming jackson to be the teams point guard he even started a few games for the gauchos everything was just how jackson planned except one thing winning i think i was a little spoiled at mater dei jackson said i went from losing five games in two years to losing five games in two weeks by the end of the season jackson was at an alltime low he wasnt playing much the team wasnt winning and basketball stopped being fun pimm met with jackson over the summer and told him he was welcome to stay but not obligated i told him that in the end chris jackson was the only person he had to satisfy pimm said if he stuck it out he might have the success he was looking for but i told him he should make a decision with himself in mind jackson decided to leave and transferred to rancho santiago he sat out his first year and got as far away from the basketball court as he could when a kid takes a year off like that you never really know if hes going to come back rancho santiago coach dana pagett said chris just said he needed the time to himself we never had any meeting although i made it a point to bump into him once in a while the dons won the orange empire conference and reached the semifinals of the state playoffs once again recruiters came calling but this time jackson was ready he made visits to tcu boise state the university of san diego and the university of the pacific i was sitting in coach pagetts office one day talking about all the schools i had visited jackson said i didnt really want to go to any of them he asked what was wrong with those programs finally he said youre just been spoiled by winning i realized he was right and that ruled out all those schools division ii was the only other option jackson was the starting point guard for riverside last season averaging 98 points 49 rebounds and 38 assists per game the highlanders finished 228 and shared the ccaa title with cal state bakersfield this season his numbers have improved but not dramatically 10 points 5 rebounds and 5 assists per game but its enough that the highlanders are successful on the court anything else is just a bonus
