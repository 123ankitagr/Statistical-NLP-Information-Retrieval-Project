the best bit of living history in dubai is its creek where neither the shape of the wooden dhows nor their profitable trade have changed much since 800 settlers led by the the maktoum family deserted abu dhabi to set up shop on its shores more than 160 years ago only the contents of the galleon-hulled boats and the replacement of sails by diesel engines mark the tides of time stacked boxes of sony tvs zanussi fridges or plastic-wrapped japanese car tyres along the quay are recent additions to hand-written cargo manifests which still include the bags of rice and spices which have always found their way from dubai's port to iran pakistan india and beyond while locals are keen to point out that little arrives illicitly in dubai customs officials say illegal drug imports are minor and hotly pursued by the police it is still a thriving source of smuggling into iran india and pakistan we pay no taxes to work here says one indian shipper but we use the money we save to pay the iranian police the creek was also once among the world's biggest gold trading centres mostly supplying gold to india at its peak in the late 1960 s dubai was importing 280 tons of gold for re-export a figure down to just over 100 tons these days dubai's creek curls further inland than any other in the emirates and has traditionally been the coast's busiest and most cosmopolitan the earliest settlers lived on the western spit of shindaghah now essentially part of port rashid dubai's man-made port but by the late nineteenth century a large indian community had settled on the western dubai side of the creek with arabs and persians principally on the eastern deira shore by the late 1800 s dubai was already the busiest trading port among the trucial states named after their treaty agreement with colonial britain and among the busiest pearling centres a trade worth around pounds 1.5 m a year to the region at the turn of the century before the advent of the japanese cultured pearl killed the industry in the late 1920 s but trade notably dhow trade smuggling sugar tea cloth and gold into persian and indian ports flourished by 1951, gray mackenzie the british shippers built dubai's first port crane which still stands near the ruler's office where all cargo was unloaded the first road bridge over the creek the maktoum bridge which is soon to be replaced with a newer eight-lane cousin was opened in only 1963, before which passengers between dubai and deira had either to drive around the creek to the north or cross on the small wooden abra vessels water taxis which still dissect the dhows paths today by the mid 1960 s dubai's creek was full to bursting with dhows and steamers and the arrival of pioneering oil construction companies such as mcdermott to dubai so clogged the emirate's main artery that sheikh rashid the father of the present ruler sheikh maktoum bin rashid al maktoum decreed the building of port rashid adjacent to the creek and still dubai's busiest port with the later addition of jebel ali port in 1979, the creek's contribution to dubai's trade has diminished considerably to around half a per cent of the total tonnage landed yearly in dubai but it thrives about its own business as ever with dhows lining the length of the eastern shore moored three four or even seven or eight abreast congestion which a new marina to be built over the next year or so is designed to clear the quay is busiest at dusk as steel-shouldered crew load the wooden dhows bhoums and launches which old as they appear have for the most part been built recently with bundles boxes and in some cases and with the minimum of mechanical assistance small cars ready for the two-day journey to kish island or bandar abbas in iran or on to karachi in pakistan most of the boats are chartered by local shippers one typically was loaded with 700 sony tvs bound for kish island in iran a trip for which a local electronics distributor had paid dh7 000, having unloaded the sonys from port rashid for re-export most of the iranian indian pakistani or sri lankan crewmen live very simply on board their boats beneath the flat sunshade canopies at the rear housing a few basic mattresses and perhaps a small barbecue or the occasional hubble-bubble pipe today the creek where wilfred thesiger the great british arabist explorer of the 1940 s watched as naked children romped in the shallows and rowing boats patrolled the creek to pick up passengers from the mouths of alleys between high coral houses surmounted with square wind-turrets' is lined on the east by a motley collection of bold and modernistic high-rises and retains its romance only at quay side gone too is the british bank of the middle east's very special lavatory remembered by edward henderson the iraq petroleum company's representative in dubai in the late 1940 s this he recalls was really no more than a platform sticking out over the water with the essential slit in its middle tastefully boxed in and screened from view with palm branches but changed as it is the creek is in for a further facelift a grassy 18-hole golf course on the north-eastern side of the creek dubai's second is already almost complete and a further illuminated nine hole course and yacht club will follow on the west bank earth is already being moved to create what will become dubai's biggest and greenest park while at the end of the creek near where a shallow lagoon has become a temporary home to hundreds of flamingos the occasional osprey reef herons and countless plovers and shanks is planned a theme park the old creek is coming under a lot of developmental pressure remarks mr lawrence mills of the dubai commerce and tourism promotions board thesiger contemplating the creek more than 50 years ago reflected that here life moved in time with the past adding regretful of his distinguishing european garb that i myself felt that i was little better than a tourist how times have changed
