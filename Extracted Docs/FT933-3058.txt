correction published 20th september 1993 appended to this article international investors have been gripped by enthusiasm for the catastrophe reinsurance market in recent months a string of new ventures has brought more than dollars 3bn pounds 19bn in new capital to bermuda the atlantic island whose loosely regulated and taxfree offshore market has been the focus of much recent activity the current boom ought to be relatively long and very profitable with the departure of up to 200 reinsurance companies because of recent catastrophe losses rates have increased sharply however many in the industry are already warning that expansion has been too quick and that the rapid supply of capital into the market could lead to a resumption of rate competition mr angus runciman analyst with bzw says the speed with which the fresh capital has been sucked in is alarming it could end in tears rates for catastrophe reinsurance initially rose steeply in 1990 and 1991 after billion dollar losses sucked up to dollars 10bn in capital from the industry many leading players including the gooda walker and feltrim lloyds syndicates were eliminated reducing competition among the suppliers of highlevel covers and destroying the socalled spiral market where reinsurers offset their own exposures with each other two losses in particular a typhoon in japan in 1991 and hurricane andrew in the us last year have given impetus to the upswing strengthening the hand of underwriters and allowing them to force through price increases mr charles skey a veteran london underwriter now working with a new bermudian company midocean says that rates are the best i have ever seen in 28 years of underwriting weve never had rates at these high levels in four of the biggest markets japan australasia north america and the uk at the same time over the past four years catastrophe rates for japanese insurers have risen more than 700 per cent while buyers in other markets have seen rates at least double or triple andrew in particular which with losses of more than dollars 15bn is the uss costliest natural disaster has been a decisive factor prompting some reinsurance companies to leave the market andrew made people sit up and realise the size of the numbers we are potentially talking about says mr runciman mr michael butt the former head of eagle star who took over as midocean chief executive in april says the sudden shrinkage of capacity in london accelerated the pace of developments in bermuda marsh mclennan the worlds biggest insurance broker and jp morgan the merchant bank sponsored midoceans formation last november with capital of dollars 350m less than a year later the company has already been to the us capital markets to raise an extra dollars 325m has reported its first profits and is preparing to step up the scale of its activities since the summer us and overseas investors and insurance companies have been launching ventures at the rate of almost one a week in bermuda there have been initiatives by american international group the worlds biggest insurer and general re the uss biggest reinsurer last months decision by swiss re the worlds second biggest reinsurer to join forces with new york investor mr john head to raise up to dollars 850m for a new bermudian venture is seen as an important show of confidence for the bermuda market london too has benefited at least three new reinsurance companies have been formed this year and the lure of profits is encouraging institutional investors to look seriously at backing new corporate members at the lloyds market mr butt suggests that the scale of capital formation will be insufficient to reintroduce rate competition dismissing comparisons with the early to mid1980s when a wave of speculative capital flooded into london new bermudian companies are using their capital more cautiously than was typical in london in the 1970s and 1980s by underwriting a maximum of 50 cents of premium for each dollar of capital giving them solvency ratios at least twice as high as was common five years ago reinsurers are also now tending to underwrite what the market calls bigger net lines retaining more exposure on their own books mr butt expects the demand for catastrophe reinsurance could increase as a result of trends in the proportional reinsurance market where reinsurers accept a proportion of premium from a direct insurer in return for the same proportion of exposures less a ceding commission especially in europe big european reinsurers such as munich re and swiss re which dominate this market are placing limits on the amount of catastrophe exposure they are prepared to accept in proportional deals forcing many european insurers to buy more catastrophe cover and lending support to upward rating trends nevertheless many in the industry remain unconvinced that the new capacity will not affect rates there are already isolated reports that brokers are attempting to use the threat of competition to obtain better rates and although bermudian companies have so far tended to write following lines underwriting portions of risk but leaving lead underwriters in london to determine rates and conditions this could begin to change next year some of the new bermudian capital is out to make shortterm profits next year if some of these companies find they are writing insufficient premiums they may start to press rates down sugone analyst at the moment the new bermudian companies are swimming alongside the whales but how long will it be before they want to make waves of their own asks mr runciman reinsurance premiums soar attracting new capital new reinsurance ventures deals completed in 1993 lloyds bermuda total corporate and other capital dollars dollars dollars
