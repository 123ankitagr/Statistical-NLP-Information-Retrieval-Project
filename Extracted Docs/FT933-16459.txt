forgive the inhabitants of beverly hills this weekend if they indulge in bouts of self-admiration even greater than normal this week has brought evidence that the summer of 1993 could be shaping up as a good one for the us film industry despite early flops which had some critics writing it off as a summer of stinkers the biggest hit seems certain to be jurassic park directed by steven spielberg of jaws and et fame it has been breaking industry records since it opened as every human susceptible to the hollywood publicity machine must now know it is a tale of dinosaurs brought back from extinction which proceed to run amok in a tropical theme park the stars of the film are the extraordinarily life-like reptiles created by computer graphics which provide viewers with an entirely new dimension in cinematic terror but the past 10 days have also seen the release to big audiences but mixed reviews of two more movies with substantial hit potential sleepless in seattle a romantic comedy featuring tom hanks and meg ryan and the firm starring tom cruise a thriller about a crooked law firm based on the best-seller by john grisham the summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for the us movie industry which releases its most popular films now or at christmas when people tend to have more leisure the three and a half months of summer generate about 40 per cent of annual us box office revenues so far this summer us ticket sales are up 7 per cent on 1992, according to mr john krier president of exhibitor relations a film industry consultancy who reckons that a host of films only now being released will provide a second wave of momentum it's going to be a big summer he says probably a record breaker passing 1989 that summer was the industry's best with us box office receipts soaring well over dollars 2 bn thanks to such movies as batman lethal weapon 2, honey i shrunk the kids and when harry met sally if the predictions are right there will be a much-needed psychological boost to an industry which has seen the volume of us ticket sales edge down in each of the past three calendar years and is suffering from a decline in the numbers of 13 to 25-year-old americans traditionally the most avid movie-goers however the upturn will not necessarily put the industry in better financial health for the number of films being released this summer is unusually large about 60, up by a third from last year which far outstrips any likely improvement in revenues one of the biggest winners among the top hollywood studios appears to be universal part of the mca entertainment group which is in turn owned by the japanese electronics company matsushita universal is behind jurassic park which smashed through dollars 100 m in box office receipts just nine days after its release beating the record of 10 days set by batman in 1989 industry observers reckon the film could challenge spielberg's own record for the best-selling movie of all-time set by et which grossed dollars 399 m in the us between 1983 and 1985 however allowing for ticket price inflation jurassic park would need to top dollars 650 m genuinely to beat et and that seems unlikely jurassic park certainly needs to be a monster hit for universal reputedly invested well over dollars 100 m in making and then heavily marketing the movie with an estimated dollars 25 m spent on creating the dinosaurs alone columbia part of japan's sony group is thought to have poured about dollars 100 m into the early summer's other hugely promoted film last action hero starring arnold schwarzenegger the lantern-jawed muscle man who habitually terminates villains with extreme violence in blockbuster action movies schwarzenegger received an up-front free of dollars 15 m however the film has not been a great hit observers reckon it may gross only dollars 50 m to dollars 60 m in the us and will have to rely on overseas sales to recoup its costs unlike a traditional action movie last action hero aims for a degree of sophistication gets confused and falls between all sorts of stools it contains a complex film within the film and numerous gags about classic movies including a walk-on role for sir ian mckellen playing the figure of death from ingmar bergman's seventh seal let loose in present-day manhattan but sony matsushita's long-time rival has other potential winners in its hand and it needs them badly since its us entertainment industry profits are now playing a big role in offsetting the poor state of the japanese electronics market its tri-star studio is responsible for sleepless in seattle which was directed by nora ephron author of the 1989 hit when sally met harry and later this month columbia will release a new clint eastwood film in the line of fire which deals with an attempt to assassinate the us president perhaps more than any other big studio paramount needs a string of hits to bolster the lacklustre profits record of its parent paramount communications it had a strong performer earlier this year with indecent proposal featuring robert redford but then stumbled at the start of the summer with sliver starring sharon stone hollywood's latest sex symbol critics panned the film now however it may have a blockbuster on its hands with the firm which grossed dollars 7.2 m on its first night neither walt disney nor warner brothers part of the time warner media empire seems to have anything as strong though disney's what's love got to do with it a biography of rock star tina turner is playing well compensating for the company's flop with the comedy super mario brothers but while the summer is young dinosaurs seem set to rule the film world
