forgive the inhabitants of beverly hills this weekend if they indulge in bouts of selfadmiration even greater than normal this week has brought evidence that the summer of 1993 could be shaping up as a good one for the us film industry despite early flops which had some critics writing it off as a summer of stinkers the biggest hit seems certain to be jurassic park directed by steven spielberg of jaws and et fame it has been breaking industry records since it opened as every human susceptible to the hollywood publicity machine must now know it is a tale of dinosaurs brought back from extinction which proceed to run amok in a tropical theme park the stars of the film are the extraordinarily lifelike reptiles created by computer graphics which provide viewers with an entirely new dimension in cinematic terror but the past 10 days have also seen the release to big audiences but mixed reviews of two more movies with substantial hit potential sleepless in seattle a romantic comedy featuring tom hanks and meg ryan and the firm starring tom cruise a thriller about a crooked law firm based on the bestseller by john grisham the summer season is one of the two the most important times of the year for the us movie industry which releases its most popular films now or at christmas when people tend to have more leisure the three and a half months of summer generate about 40 per cent of annual us box office revenues so far this summer us ticket sales are up 7 per cent on 1992 according to mr john krier president of exhibitor relations a film industry consultancy who reckons that a host of films only now being released will provide a second wave of momentum its going to be a big summer he says probably a record breaker passing 1989 that summer was the industrys best with us box office receipts soaring well over dollars 2bn thanks to such movies as batman lethal weapon 2 honey i shrunk the kids and when harry met sally if the predictions are right there will be a muchneeded psychological boost to an industry which has seen the volume of us ticket sales edge down in each of the past three calendar years and is suffering from a decline in the numbers of 13 to 25yearold americans traditionally the most avid moviegoers however the upturn will not necessarily put the industry in better financial health for the number of films being released this summer is unusually large about 60 up by a third from last year which far outstrips any likely improvement in revenues one of the biggest winners among the top hollywood studios appears to be universal part of the mca entertainment group which is in turn owned by the japanese electronics company matsushita universal is behind jurassic park which smashed through dollars 100m in box office receipts just nine days after its release beating the record of 10 days set by batman in 1989 industry observers reckon the film could challenge spielbergs own record for the bestselling movie of alltime set by et which grossed dollars 399m in the us between 1983 and 1985 however allowing for ticket price inflation jurassic park would need to top dollars 650m genuinely to beat et and that seems unlikely jurassic park certainly needs to be a monster hit for universal reputedly invested well over dollars 100m in making and then heavily marketing the movie with an estimated dollars 25m spent on creating the dinosaurs alone columbia part of japans sony group is thought to have poured about dollars 100m into the early summers other hugely promoted film last action hero starring arnold schwarzenegger the lanternjawed muscle man who habitually terminates villains with extreme violence in blockbuster action movies schwarzenegger received an upfront free of dollars 15m however the film has not been a great hit observers reckon it may gross only dollars 50m to dollars 60m in the us and will have to rely on overseas sales to recoup its costs unlike a traditional action movie last action hero aims for a degree of sophistication gets confused and falls between all sorts of stools it contains a complex film within the film and numerous gags about classic movies including a walkon role for sir ian mckellen playing the figure of death from ingmar bergmans seventh seal let loose in presentday manhattan but sony matsushitas longtime rival has other potential winners in its hand and it needs them badly since its us entertainment industry profits are now playing a big role in offsetting the poor state of the japanese electronics market its tristar studio is responsible for sleepless in seattle which was directed by nora ephron author of the 1989 hit when sally met harry and later this month columbia will release a new clint eastwood film in the line of fire which deals with an attempt to assassinate the us president perhaps more than any other big studio paramount needs a string of hits to bolster the lacklustre profits record of its parent paramount communications it had a strong performer earlier this year with indecent proposal featuring robert redford but then stumbled at the start of the summer with sliver starring sharon stone hollywoods latest sex symbol critics panned the film now however it may have a blockbuster on its hands with the firm which grossed dollars 72m on its first night neither walt disney nor warner brothers part of the time warner media empire seems to have anything as strong though disneys whats love got to do with it a biography of rock star tina turner is playing well compensating for the companys flop with the comedy super mario brothers but while the summer is young dinosaurs seem set to rule the film world
