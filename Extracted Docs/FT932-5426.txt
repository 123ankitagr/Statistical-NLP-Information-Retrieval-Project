Georgia , in the throes of civil war , has become the latest former Soviet republic to announce plans to abandon the rouble as its currency , writes Leyla Boulton . Mr Tengiz Sigua , the Georgian prime minister , was quoted yesterday by Interfax news agency as saying the rouble would be replaced by coupons issued in April to pay wages , pensions and student grants after Russia cut off deliveries of banknotes . He did not say when this would occur . Meanwhile , President Boris Yeltsin yesterday threatened to impose economic sanctions on impoverished former Soviet republics which did not repay their debts to it .
