i read in a recent financial times article that the first slice of dividend income is covered by personal allowances as there are three types of income and three rate bands it appears that allowances cannot simply be deducted from the total gross income can you confirm that the allowances are set against the type of income carrying the highest rate band first excluding chargeable capital gains also are capital gains used to determine whether age allowance should be reduced 1 yes your allowances are set primarily against your non-dividend income 2 capital gains do not affect your entitlement to age allowance the inland revenue did try to restrict age relief by taking capital gains into account at one time but admitted that this was unlawful in the 1970 s no legal responsibility can be accepted by the financial times for the answers given in these columns all enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible
