I READ in a recent Financial Times article that the first slice of dividend income is covered by personal allowances . As there are three types of income and three rate bands it appears that allowances can not simply be deducted from the total gross income . Can you confirm that the allowances are set against the type of income carrying the highest rate band first - excluding chargeable capital gains ? Also , are capital gains used to determine whether age allowance should be reduced ? 1 ) Yes , your allowances are set primarily against your non-dividend income . 2 ) Capital gains do not affect your entitlement to age allowance . The Inland Revenue did try to restrict age relief by taking capital gains into account at one time , but admitted that this was unlawful in the 1970s . No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns . All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible .
