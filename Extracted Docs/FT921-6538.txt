BRIERLEY Investments ( BIL ) has increased its stake in Air New Zealand to 42.5 per cent . Its announcement yesterday came as the airline reported a sharp upturn in performance . The airline 's after-tax profit rose to NZDollars 58.27m ( USDollars 31.6m ) in the six months to December 31 , compared with NZDollars 10.88m for the six months to September 30 1990 . The company has changed its year-end to June . Operating profits swung from a loss of NZDollars 7.2m to a profit of NZDollars 65.5m . Abnormal items , relating to redundancy payments , reduced operating profit by NZDollars 7.3m . Brierley said it had bought American Airline 's 5 per cent stake in Air New Zealand for NZDollars 37m . It was paying NZDollars 1.80 a share , compared with a market price of about NZDollars 1.84 . The move follows widespread reports that Air New Zealand is to play a big role in the expected deregulation of the Australian airline industry . American Airlines had previously tried to sell its stake to Qantas , which owns 20 per cent of Air New Zealand , but the sale was rejected by the government on the grounds that it would give Qantas market dominance . When Air New Zealand was privatised , BIL bought an initial 65 per cent , but this was reduced to 35 per cent through a public flotation . Last year , BIL bought an additional 2.5 per cent from American Airlines . Mr Bob Matthew , chairman , said Air New Zealand was on target to reach a NZDollars 85m operating profit for the year to June 30 . He said the company usually experienced a much lower level of demand in the April-June quarter and the trend was expected to continue this year . The company is reintroducing an interim dividend of 4 cents a share .
