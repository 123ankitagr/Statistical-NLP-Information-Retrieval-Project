corporate venturing in the uk has failed to match early hopes according to a paper published last week corporate venturing is the process where big business invests in small business through taking minority equity stakes usually in emergent high-technology companies it is supposed to provide windows on new tech nology takeover opportunities as research matures and eventually big profits investment may be direct but is more usually via a fund run by an experienced venture capital manager used to finding growing businesses worth backing the paper by kevin mcnally of the urban policy research unit at southampton university makes depressing reading for anyone who attended a 1984 london conference organised by arthur andersen the accountancy firm and venture economics the collector and publisher of venture capital data the conference tried to persuade chairmen chief executives and finance directors of leading uk companies that corporate venturing was a good thing what has happened since can only be interpreted as 10 years of failure as mcnally reveals whereas the us venture capital industry received about 20 per cent of funds from corporate venturers during the 1980 s britain's peaked at a 6 per cent share pounds 34 m in 1988 and a value of pounds 62 m 4 per cent share in 1989 mcnally says there is some evidence of pick-up since pounds 50 m from corporate sources in 1992 and a 15 per cent share of funds raised last year but pension funds insurance companies and other financial institutions continue to dominate the ranks of fund-providers the research covered 41 venture capital funds although 16 had attracted corporate venturing contributions the base is narrow 12 were run by advent international and only one-third of all the corporate venturers were uk companies 30 per cent were from the us 11 per cent japan and 7 per cent australia of the remaining funds six had been rebuffed by companies they approached and many of the others had not bothered on the grounds that there were easier ways of getting investors many fund managers believe corporate venturers are not worth the trouble they are seen as short-termist with unrealistic expectations of quick spectacular returns they also fail to understand how venture capitalism works as a portfolio of investments where the lemons ripen before the plums corporate venturers may be less common in the uk because of the industry's focus seed capital start-up or early-stage funding accounted for 31 per cent of monies disbursed by us funds in 1991, compared with 6 per cent in the uk also if management buy-outs and buy-ins are excluded 84 per cent of us disbursements were in technology-related projects against the uk's 30 per cent this suggests the uk venture capital industry may not actually be doing much in the market segment where corporate venturing might appeal more to big companies mcnally thinks corporate venturers could fill funding gaps now appearing as pension funds and insurance companies become more cautious his research is useful because it shows how to develop more mutual self-interest for both sides potential corporate venturers need to correct their long-term vision but venture capital funds need to find more technological projects at a fundamental or prototype stage for them to look at one problem however remains the same as spelt out by a speaker at the 1984 conference large companies are usually very uncomfortable with small businesses there is often an attitude of if it's good why don't we own all of it if it's bad why are we messing about like this it looks uphill all the way sources of finance for uk venture capital funds the role of corporate investors by kevin mcnally urban policy research unit department of geography university of southampton price pounds 10
