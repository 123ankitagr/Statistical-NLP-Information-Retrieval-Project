don henley has a gripe against his exband mate joe walsh who is touring with ringo starr and performing what henley describes as the phony version of life in the fast lane i dont know why he feels compelled to do that song henley told the baltimore sun nobody else is doing that kind of thing im sort of puzzled as to why he doesnt do one of his own songs but i never could figure the guy out so why start now henley said he not only sang that eagles classic on the original record but also wrote about half of it walsh on the other hand really didnt have hardly anything to do with it he wrote the little guitar riff thats in the introduction of the song and thats basically all shauna snow
