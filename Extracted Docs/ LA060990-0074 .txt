A 20-year veteran FBI agent , who told the agency in 1988 that he is homosexual , filed suit in federal court to block his imminent dismissal , loss of security clearance and loss of pension . The case is believed to be the first in the nation by an agent challenging the loss of his job based on homosexual discrimination , according to Richard Gayer , the agent 's lawyer . The agent , identified in the lawsuit only as John Doe , accused the FBI of discrimination based on sexual preference in violation of the Constitution 's equal protection clause , as well as violation of his constitutional rights of free speech and free association . FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez would not comment directly on the lawsuit but said : `` Our concern is sexual conduct , not sexual preference . ''
