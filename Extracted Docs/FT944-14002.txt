Deutsche Bundespost Telekom , Germany 's national telephone operator , and Microsoft of the US , the world 's largest supplier of computer software , have agreed to work together to develop multimedia products and services . The memorandum of understanding , signed last week between Mr Bill Gates , Microsoft chairman and Mr Horst Gellert , Telekom board member , provides for Microsoft 's Windows architecture to be used as the basis for Telekom's developments in multimedia . Mr Thomas Koll of Microsoft Germany said yesterday that Telekom would have access to Microsoft 's unpublished Windows95 software . He said it was significant that Europe 's largest telecommunications operator should have chosen Microsoft 's technology as the basis of their services . However , the partnership was at a very early stage and few firm decisions had been made . There were at this stage no financial implications , he said . Within six months , he expected that Telekom could say how it intended to use Windows software , which substitutes pictures on the screen for textual instructions . Mr Koll said no decision had been made on whether Telekom would use Tiger Microsoft software , which is claimed to be able to use networks of inexpensive micro computers to provide services such as video-on-demand . Other companies are using supercomputers to provide the processing power .
