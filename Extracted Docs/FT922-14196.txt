AMERICAN EXPRESS Bank has appointed John Saverino , at present executive director and senior marketing group head at American Express International Capital Corp in New York , to be the first general manager of American Express Bank 's newly created UK region . The move follows a shake-up in American Express Bank 's European management structure . The bank 's UK operations have been detached from the rest of Europe and Saverino , 46 , will control all its UK services at a testing time for the banking industry as a whole . American Express Bank is a sister company of the famous Travel Related Services division which issues charge cards and cheques . The bank provides up-market banking services to wealthy individuals and selected financial institutions through four separate business divisions : private banking , commercial services , correspondent banking , and treasury products and services . Saverino has been brought in to refocus the bank 's European business with a greater emphasis on the UK . Vice president of Manufacturers Hanover Leasing Corporation for six years before joining American Express in 1979 , Saverino has two children and lists his recreations as tennis , American football and theatre-going .
