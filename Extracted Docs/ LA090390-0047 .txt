Today marks the celebration of Labor Day , set aside to recognize labor 's contribution to the nation . Credit for the idea of Labor Day is given to Matthew Maguire , a New Jersey machinist , and Peter J. McGuire of New York , co- founder of a labor organization that eventually became the American Federation of Labor . After several states began observing the first Monday in September as Labor Day in the 1880s , Congress made the day a federal holiday in 1894 . * Closed : All government offices , courts , banks , post offices , stock and commodity exchanges , libraries and many businesses . RTD buses will follow Sunday schedules .
