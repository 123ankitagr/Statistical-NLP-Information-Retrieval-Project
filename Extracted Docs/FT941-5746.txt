Color Line , the Norwegian ferry group , reports a decline in 1993 pre-tax profits , to NKr64m ( Dollars 8.6m ) from NKr81m in 1992 , writes Karen Fossli in Oslo . The setback stemmed from a weak performance in the first four months , plus a write-off of NKr58m on a ferry which is to be sold . Revenue rose to NKr1.81bn from NKr1.68bn . Operating income improved to NKr429m from NKr426m . Color Line had a difficult start in 1993 , with gross operating profit for the first four months dipping by NKr36m , the company said .
