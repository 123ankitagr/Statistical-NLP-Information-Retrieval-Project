Yesterday 's annual meeting of British Petroleum and the turn-out of the company 's top brass raises a mischievous question . Does BP 's new board contain both Britain 's tallest Footsie company director ( Lord Ashburton , the chairman ) and its shortest ( John Browne , managing director of exploration ) ? You would n't know it from BP 's annual report ; careful picture cropping has been a great leveller . But Observer is certain that the BP board is living testimony to the fact that height is no guide to ability .
