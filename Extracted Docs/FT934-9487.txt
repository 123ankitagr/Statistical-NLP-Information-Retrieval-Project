SEGA , the Japanese games company which is challenging world leader Nintendo with its popular Sonic the Hedgehog games , increased sales and profits in the first half of the year , but could not escape the effects of recession altogether . Sega , which makes amusement hall games as well as video games for home use , reported a 20 per cent increase in sales to Y200.65bn . from Y167.34bn and a 4.4 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y28.58bn . The company said it had seen strong demand for its arcade and home video games , but it had not been able to avoid entirely the slowdown in consumption , particularly in Japan where the sluggish economy has affected job security . The company said that its commercial games machines had seen a slowdown in demand as businesses refrained from making new purchases . In the video games market , consumers have become increasingly selective and competition was fierce . The Japanese market , in particular , has seen products being discounted heavily . Sega said that it expects to increase its market share in the consumer video games market by introducing Sonic the Hedgehog III , software for its line-up of 16-bit games machines , hand-held video games and CD-ROM players . It is forecasting sales for the full year of Y380bn , up from Y346.94 and pre-tax profits of Y57.5bn against Y55.02 previously .
