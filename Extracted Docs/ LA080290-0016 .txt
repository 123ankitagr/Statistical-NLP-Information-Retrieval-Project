george bush is going to be a oneterm president people will vote their pocketbooks in 1992 as they have in about 48 of the 50 presidential elections weve had so far if things are looking up the ones who make the difference will stick with what theyve got which has been the republicans for more than 10 years now if things are bad theyll change and put in a democrat it looks as if things will be bad the savings and loans are gone with a lot of our money real estate prices are collapsing trapping sellers in their homes or forcing them to default the cycle of mortgage foreclosures and no buyers will soon enough lead to bank failures around the country a political analyst named bush said in 1988 this was one of the true things he said that for the democrats to do well america has to do badly that appears to be happening now in 1990 well bad luck for bush he has been an extraordinarily lucky candidate and president up to now but in 1992 a lot of voters will abandon him that is not because they like democrats or any particular democrat all that well nor do they particularly like politics or government either but it is becoming obvious to almost everybody that this bunch of republicans did not really want to stop what government does they just wanted to control what it did or did not do they did that and failed miserably at a lot of it
