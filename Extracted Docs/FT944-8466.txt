alec gordon is commodities and energy editor of the economist intelligence unit if 1994 was the year commodity markets woke up then 1995 could be the big breakfast at least for speculators the attraction of markets in physical commodities as distinct from markets in bonds and other financial commodities is that they move in cycles boom follows bust and shortage glut in predictable and therefore profitable succession that's the theory at least for most of the more important commodities in 1994, demand at last caught up with supply in some such as natural rubber the market had become so depressed that productive capacity had been lost the impact upon prices of revived demand when it came was dramatic in others such as aluminium and other base metals the picture was obscured by exceptional flows of metal from the former soviet bloc the year 1995 will be one in which both supply and demand for most major commodities will be rising in most commodities demand will be winning and prices although rising will become more volatile this will be good news for speculators but bad for producers and consumers for whom volatility turns the serious business of commodity production and consumption into something of a gamble two factors will combine to destabilise markets as prices revive support for price-stabilising commodity pacts on the part of producers will fade of the old-style inter-governmental agreements the international natural rubber agreement looks like being the only one to survive into 1995 with its economic provisions intact in short the effects of government attempts to dampen price movements will dwindle at the same time attempts by the us general accounting office and other government agencies to restrict and regulate the activities of so-called hedge funds which benefit from commodity price volatility will fail this is because the funds are too protean too big and too much part of wider money-management operations to be readily controllable however much regulators across the world might want to try the funds operate through futures markets which exist to provide insurance against risk in commodity transactions arising from price volatility as well as a forum for speculation but do futures markets themselves cause volatility an analysis of what drives commodity prices suggests they do conventionally commodity prices are thought to be driven at least in the long run by fundamentals of supply and demand there are other fundamentals such as lead times longer for tree crops and mining shorter for annual crops and substitution possibilities high for fibres vegoils and natural rubber low for beverage commodities this the market at its macro level taking no account of the impact of sentiment on prices and missing an important part of the picture at the micro level the dynamics are as different in commodity markets as they are in physics here the long run ceases to exist and is replaced by the day to day at this level commodity prices are not made by supply and demand instead they are made by traders responding to what they believe supply and demand to be even this is not quite right from day to day commodity prices are made by traders responding to what they believe other traders believe supply and demand will be at some point in the future so sentiment or belief is what actually makes prices not the abstractions of supply and demand real though these are and to a commodity trader volatility represents an opportunity as well as a risk indeed futures markets need volatility with no price risk to insure against there can be no profitable insurance the london futures market in natural rubber died a few years ago for lack of business when prices were stable futures markets also need speculators since it is they who provide the liquidity essential to running the market in a sense they are the market although speculators find it important to keep within the consensus it is equally important to trade as close as possible to the margin of that consensus to jump on and off bandwagons first it is this need expressed collectively and backed by massive financial resources which swings prices the potential gap between market sentiment and fundamentals between belief at the micro level and reality at the macro level varies inversely with time over the short term where the gap is at its widest and where a lot of money is made and lost in futures markets sentiment and market behaviour are all-important here lies the opportunity for computers and for rocket scientists computers are good at pattern recognition they are already almost unbeatable at chess and getting better all the time and their use in program trading has grown enormously in fact that growth prompts a cybernetic prediction as the patterns recognised become more incestuous program trading will itself become riskier meanwhile in the real world the business of buying and selling actual bales of cotton and bags of coffee will continue this is the market addressed by the economist intelligence unit's world commodity forecasts wcf the wcf is aimed mainly at those involved directly in the production and use of commodities and at the medium and longer term because of this it misses much of the day-to-day change in sentiment but it does aim to pick up longer-term shifts in the balance of supply and demand commodities in chronically short supply through much of 1995 are likely to be coffee most of the base metals and natural rubber
