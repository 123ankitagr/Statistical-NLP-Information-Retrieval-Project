last year the uks balance of trade deficit on motor vehicles shrank sharply from more than pounds 6bn to about pounds 15bn much of the fall was due to a uk new car market collapse preventing the usual high volume of imports from being sucked in even so mr geoffrey whalen uk motor industry veteran past president of the society of motor manufacturers and traders and chevalier de la legion dhonneur could derive much satisfaction from the export contribution made by peugeot talbot the french vehicles groups uk subsidiary of which he has been chief executive for nearly a decade it is that contribution notably the overseas shipment in recent years of seven out of every 10 cars that peugeot talbot produces at its ryton plant near coventry which has led to its receipt of the queens award for exporting along the way and partly as a reflection of its colourful varied and sometimes troubled past peugeot talbot has developed markets for its cars and parts not just in france and other ec states but in australasia southeast asia africa and pakistan new markets are being found in eastern europe one of the worlds main potential growth areas for vehicles at least in the long term with hungary and czechoslovakia among the companys peugeot talbots early targets in unit terms the companys export contribution last year amounted to 60000 cars all versions of the peugeot 405 the mediumsized saloon which is the only model currently produced by peugeot talbots 6000strong uk workforce to put that in context total output at ryton was 87000 cars so the precise export content was just under 69 per cent the previous year before the uk market began collapsing ryton built 116000 cars of which more than 81000 went for export these ukbuilt 405s went to a total of 20 countries although numerically by far the greatest proportion went to france and other ec states despite the award in financial terms peugeot talbot almost certainly remains a net importer its rapidly rising market share in the uk currently around 7 per cent means that last years uk sales of around 112000 units were met by 17000 ukbuilt 405s and more than 90000 peugeot 205 309 and 605 models imported from peugeots continental plants in addition many of the parts used to produce the rytonbuilt cars are imported from the continent given that in the early 1980s there were strong doubts as to whether peugeot talbot had any kind of manufacturing future in the uk however the companys achievements are not to be underestimated born out of the french parents takeover of chryslers deeplytroubled european activities in the late 1970s peugeot talbot inherited in the uk for example the illfated linwood plant in scotland and lacklustre models such as the hillman avenger sunbeam and alpine plus a valuable contract supplying peykans essentially rebadged hillman hunters to iran in quantities which at their peak hit 100000 a year linwoods closure the iranian revolution and shrinking uk sales had by 1983 created a pretty grim picture the decision to withdraw all design and development activities from the uk inevitably created fears that peugeot talbot would become just a sales company for foreignbuilt peugeots peugeot agonised looked at the industrial relations improvements being nurtured by mr whalen in his initial role as personnel director and decided to invest pounds 30m in reequipping ryton to produce a fully competitive car the peugeot 309 by 1987 far from manufacturing disappearing from ryton there was talk of putting on a night shift two years later with the larger 405 proving one of europes major success stories ryton was dedicated to producing the 405 exclusively next year however peugeot talbots own balance of trade pendulum should be swinging sharply towards the positive once more ryton is to become a twomodel plant again building the replacement for the 309 as well as the 405 when as expected the good times return to the uk new car market towards the mid1990s peugeot talbot is expected not only to have the capacity to make 200000 cars a year but actually to be using it
