last year the uk's balance of trade deficit on motor vehicles shrank sharply from more than pounds 6 bn to about pounds 1.5 bn much of the fall was due to a uk new car market collapse preventing the usual high volume of imports from being sucked in even so mr geoffrey whalen uk motor industry veteran past president of the society of motor manufacturers and traders and chevalier de la legion d'honneur could derive much satisfaction from the export contribution made by peugeot talbot the french vehicles group's uk subsidiary of which he has been chief executive for nearly a decade it is that contribution notably the overseas shipment in recent years of seven out of every 10 cars that peugeot talbot produces at its ryton plant near coventry which has led to its receipt of the queen's award for exporting along the way and partly as a reflection of its colourful varied and sometimes troubled past peugeot talbot has developed markets for its cars and parts not just in france and other ec states but in australasia south-east asia africa and pakistan new markets are being found in eastern europe one of the world's main potential growth areas for vehicles at least in the long term with hungary and czechoslovakia among the company's peugeot talbot's early targets in unit terms the company's export contribution last year amounted to 60,000 cars all versions of the peugeot 405, the medium-sized saloon which is the only model currently produced by peugeot talbot's 6,000 strong uk workforce to put that in context total output at ryton was 87,000 cars so the precise export content was just under 69 per cent the previous year before the uk market began collapsing ryton built 116,000 cars of which more than 81,000 went for export these uk-built 405 s went to a total of 20 countries although numerically by far the greatest proportion went to france and other ec states despite the award in financial terms peugeot talbot almost certainly remains a net importer its rapidly rising market share in the uk currently around 7 per cent means that last year's uk sales of around 112,000 units were met by 17,000 uk-built 405 s and more than 90,000 peugeot 205, 309 and 605 models imported from peugeot's continental plants in addition many of the parts used to produce the ryton-built cars are imported from the continent given that in the early 1980 s there were strong doubts as to whether peugeot talbot had any kind of manufacturing future in the uk however the company's achievements are not to be underestimated born out of the french parent's takeover of chrysler's deeply-troubled european activities in the late 1970 s peugeot talbot inherited in the uk for example the ill-fated linwood plant in scotland and lacklustre models such as the hillman avenger sunbeam and alpine plus a valuable contract supplying peykans essentially rebadged hillman hunters to iran in quantities which at their peak hit 100,000 a year linwood's closure the iranian revolution and shrinking uk sales had by 1983 created a pretty grim picture the decision to withdraw all design and development activities from the uk inevitably created fears that peugeot talbot would become just a sales company for foreign-built peugeots peugeot agonised looked at the industrial relations improvements being nurtured by mr whalen in his initial role as personnel director and decided to invest pounds 30 m in re-equipping ryton to produce a fully competitive car the peugeot 309 by 1987, far from manufacturing disappearing from ryton there was talk of putting on a night shift two years later with the larger 405 proving one of europe's major success stories ryton was dedicated to producing the 405 exclusively next year however peugeot talbot's own balance of trade pendulum should be swinging sharply towards the positive once more ryton is to become a two-model plant again building the replacement for the 309 as well as the 405 when as expected the good times return to the uk new car market towards the mid-1990s peugeot talbot is expected not only to have the capacity to make 200,000 cars a year but actually to be using it
