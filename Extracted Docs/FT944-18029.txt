Peugeot Citroen , the French carmaker , is seeking to cut costs substantially in order to increase its international competitiveness , Mr Jacques Calvet , chairman , said yesterday . The target was to reduce purchasing costs by 15 per cent and investment costs by 30 per cent during the next three years . The Peugeot group staged a strong recovery in the first half this year , with a pre-tax profit of FFr1.02bn ( Dollars 192m ) compared with a loss of FFr1.85bn in the same period a year ago . The group is aiming to improve productivity in its plants by more than 12 per cent this year , having achieved a similar increase in both 1992 and 1993 . The target of cutting investment costs by 30 per cent in the next three years while maintaining the same overall level of spending would allow the group to accelerate its product development programme . Mr Calvet said Peugeot was also seeking to reduce significantly the time taken to develop new vehicles . New projects started in the next two years would cut development times from 44 to 36 months , while the costs of producing prototype vehicles would be cut by 10 per cent a year . The carmaker , which is largely dependent on the European market , is also determined to increase its presence in overseas markets . Mr Calvet said the group 's target was to generate 25 per cent of its sales outside Europe by the year 2000 , compared with only 14 per cent last year . It sold 75,000 vehicles in South America last year , was advancing in China and had good prospects in Malaysia and India . Mr Calvet ruled out any suggestion of a merger with Renault .
