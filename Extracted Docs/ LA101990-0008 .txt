I read with interest your editorial `` How to Make a Financial Killing '' ( Oct. 8 ) . Gang violence is a tragedy that touches us all . Your newspaper reports almost daily on the unfortunate problem and its toll . Your editorial makes many important points . In commenting on insurance salespeople who use ( and abuse ) the natural fears of people living in crime-torn neighborhoods to sell low-cost policies , you observe that the public should aim its disgust at the gang problem rather than a few `` brazen insurance salesmen . '' I agree . However , as a representative of the life insurance industry , I decry the questionable and inappropriate marketing strategies which your editorial discusses . In fact , these insurance `` salespeople '' tarnish the reputations of the vast majority who are decent , ethical and hard-working . The life insurance industry takes its community responsibilities seriously . As corporate citizens , we are involved in the community and provide ongoing support for many activities , including those that serve the needs of urban areas .
