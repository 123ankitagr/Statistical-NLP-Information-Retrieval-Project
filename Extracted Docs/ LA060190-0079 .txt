Your support of Prop . 117 seems to be based on the emotional premise of `` stop the big bad hunter , '' despite the monetary problems with this proposition . The real problem with Prop . 117 is that it takes wildlife management out of the hands of professionals . Wildlife management can not be left to Mother Nature any more ; people must manage wildlife for the proper balance . Nobody is proposing extinction , just management . ED MORTENSON Reseda
