The American Jewish Committee announced Friday that it has established a Pacific Rim Institute in Los Angeles to promote better understanding of Jews by Asian-Americans and the economically strong countries of the region . `` We have noticed manifestations of anti-Jewish sentiment in such nations as Japan , China and Korea , among others , '' said Bruce M. Ramer of Los Angeles , national board chairman of the American Jewish Committee who was appointed the first institute chairman . Asia is supplanting Europe in economic importance and as a leading source of immigrants , Ramer said during the meeting of the American Jewish Committee 's National Executive Council this week in Beverly Hills . `` As a result of changes in U.S. immigration and refugee policy , '' Ramer said , `` there are now just as many people of Asian background living in the United States as there are Jews . '' Neil Sandberg , the longtime Western regional director for the American Jewish Committee in Los Angeles , was named the institute 's director and will assume the new job full time in March .
