each summer they line up like soldiers in formation according to their desired position the problem of course is that there can only be so many generals such was the case last year when a rather stout and unknown sophomore named brett washington announced to granada hills high coach darryl stroh that he wanted to be the highlanders next breakaway runner stroh as he had done innumerable times with other varsity hopefuls humored the lad he came in and he said he wanted to be a tailback stroh recalled and i said yeah yeah yeah sure you're more like a fullback and a nose guard washington now a 5-foot-10 215-pound junior soon proved that his objectives were not necessarily out of kilter and he restates the point every time the players line up for sprints you'd never know it stroh said but he usually finishes in the top one or two after rushing for 165 yards in granada hills 38-14 win over san fernando in last thursday's north valley league showdown washington is indeed numero uno after nine games washington has rushed for 1,082 yards in 139 carries an average of 7.4 yards a carry and scored 12 touchdowns his rushing total leads all valley-area city section players washington granada hills only full-time two-way starter is the first highlander to reach the 1,000 yard mark since khalid ali gained 1,388 in 1986 and washington also is emerging as a favorite for the north valley player of the year award as a running back he can pound inside or hit the corner and slice down the sideline as a first-year linebacker he started at defensive tackle last year washington uses his substantial bulk to put opponents down and out he turned out to be too good to put down on the defensive line stroh said when he came in last year we didn't know exactly what we had some opponents can't readily identify him either washington has been likened by some to a runaway roller coaster when handed the ball on a draw play washington is able to build momentum and is almost impossible to stop in a one-on-one situation two weeks ago after washington rolled through the middle of the cleveland defensive line for another long gain cavalier coach steve landress turned to a bystander and asked rhetorically is that kid a load or what he's a stud there's no way one guy brings him down and considering that cleveland is the only team that has kept washington out of the end zone this year those are some pretty decent kudos washington's 78-yard scoring run in the third quarter broke san fernando after being stopped for a short gain on third down the tigers were called for a face-mask penalty on the next play washington took the handoff worked his way outside and pulled away from several surprised and supposedly faster defensive backs a tie soon turned into a rout the sign of a great back stroh said is to make the first guy miss he knows that now and if washington knows this much now what about next season perhaps after canyon's chris perry who stands 6-2 and weighs 215 graduates this summer washington will emerge as the area's next big thing last year he was good granada hills co-coach tom harp said this year he's really improved he's almost great next year who knows
