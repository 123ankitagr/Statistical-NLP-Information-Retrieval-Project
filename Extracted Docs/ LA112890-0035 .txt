the election of john major on tuesday as the leader of the ruling conservative party puts a political horatio alger in no 10 downing st the home and office of british prime ministers a high school dropout who drifted from job to job until he caught on as a bank trainee and rose to become chancellor of the exchequer in margaret thatcher's cabinet major personifies the conservative party as rebuilt by thatcher to recognize talent and reward merit and the centerpiece of his five-day campaign to succeed thatcher was his vision of a classless society to reform further a country where white collar still looks down upon blue collar where englishmen disdain immigrants where ambition is often scorned as social climbing i want a genuine classless society in which people can rise to whatever level their abilities take them regardless of their origins major said last week making his claim on the conservative party leadership and the premiership that comes with it major at 47 the youngest of britain's 18 prime ministers in this century is himself a model of such a grit-and-guts rise out of poverty his election over two classic tory politicians one michael heseltine a millionaire who set himself the goal of downing street while at oxford more than 35 years ago the other douglas hurd a patrician graduate of eton and cambridge the son and grandson of conservative members of parliament symbolizes the shifts in british politics under thatcher away from the decades of battles between the country's moneyed governing class on the right and the rebellious working class on the left he is the very essence of the classless meritocrat says hugo young thatcher's biographer he went neither to public private school nor university and would thus personify and perhaps complete the routing from tory power and influence of the old landed gentry and their heirs but major is also very gray a pleasant man but nearly featureless as a politician he is invariably compared by britons to their neighborhood bank manager or perhaps the chairman of the local school committee a politician without an ideology of his own who would rather be led by a strong prime minister and well-informed officials than lead himself two writers in the left-leaning guardian said of major this week and a friendly journalist writing in the daily mail said alas for those who admire him as i do he can be deeply exasperating to that was added the more serious charge on tuesday that he would be a thatcher puppet after she was quoted as telling conservative party officials at a farewell that she would be a very good back-seat driver major already dubbed thatcher's poodle three years ago for his devotion to her policies was clearly the prime minister's preference as a successor political insiders said she had been grooming him for several years valuing his sharp mind and talents for negotiation and major described himself unhesitatingly as a thatcherite he has insisted however that he will be his own man i am not running as son of thatcher he told a television interviewer over the weekend i am running as myself with my own priorities and my own program some policy differences did emerge in the brief campaign major stressed the need for stronger measures to control inflation he called for a review and implicitly a change of the much-hated per-capita poll tax used to help finance local government services and he put an unaccustomed emphasis on social services major in the view of many analysts here had won his independence two months ago with the decision reversing thatcher policy to join the european community's exchange rate mechanism which links europe's principal currencies to one another and above all to the dominant german mark he had also promoted a further interim measure although publicly rejected by thatcher to lay the basis for an eventual common european currency while supporting all the virtues notably initiative and self-reliance that have formed the core of thatcherism for the past decade major is notably less doctrinaire i am not ideologically pure in any way he said he would continue the economic and social revolution begun by thatcher major said but the government would have to move ahead i am in the business of further change classlessness would be one of his major goals major said praising the contribution of blue-collar workers he had been a construction worker himself major said that britain must begin to treat all equally i hope the general atmosphere we create will remove those old social attitudes he said we have nearly got the property-owning democracy through the sale of government-owned housing to their occupants but we have not yet got the capital-owning democracy major said referring to the extensive privatization of state-owned enterprises under thatcher i don't mean rich men with piles of money i mean the ordinary everyperson having his own savings for the independence and security it gives them he also stressed in weekend interviews that he would be a collegial prime minister not dominating the cabinet as did thatcher the cabinet has to be the centerpiece of the government's administration he said as a chairman of cabinet committees he is very good at summing up the voices and coming down decisively for what he feels to be the common will a fellow minister who was not among his backers said of major he does not exclude people he is a good listener but another parliamentary colleague added he is quiet but not soft he definitely has a steel girder running up his backbone elected to parliament in 1979 when the conservatives won and thatcher became prime minister major worked his way up the political and governmental hierarchy holding seven jobs in the past nine years and winning promotions through his talents as a politician and administrator and devotion to thatcherism before becoming chancellor of the exchequer or the country's chief treasury official in october 1989, he served briefly as foreign secretary chief treasury secretary or principal budget officer the undersecretary of state and then minister for social security a whip in the house of commons and a parliamentary secretary for the home office minister he was the first member of parliament from the class of 79 to be promoted to the cabinet still critics said that major was not experienced enough to become the party's leader and prime minister noting that his rivals for the post had at least 10 years more experience than he but no one faulted his performance in any of those posts he even drew praise for the swift correction of a major mistake in 1987, of not immediately providing the country's old-age pensioners with additional money as a fuel subsidy during a bitter january cold spell major had been an executive of standard chartered bank one of britain's largest for 14 years before he entered national politics with the patronage of tony barber a former chancellor who was then the bank's chairman normally i discourage people from entering politics if they have a young family and don't have money barber said on tuesday john major was different he was too great a talent to ignore we had to grab him for the conservative party major learned his politics as a young conservative on a soapbox in brixton a poor racially mixed neighborhood in south london where he took on the socialist labor party for its inept management of the area's public housing projects he won election to the local council primarily with the support of blacks housing and racism were his issues as he established a reputation as a progressive he had grown up in the neighborhood after his father once a trapeze artist with ringling bros and barnum bailey circus later a vaudeville performer and then a sculptor went bankrupt manufacturing lawn ornaments the family moved from comfortable middle-class wimbledon to brixton where they lived in a two-room apartment cooked on a gas stove on the landing and shared a bathroom with other tenants major left school at 16 to help support his family he worked a variety of jobs mostly in the construction industry and once was rejected when he applied for a position as a bus conductor on grounds that he was weak in arithmetic he was unemployed for eight months and collected welfare it has been of immense value to me to have been on the other side of the fence and know what it is to face difficulties and i don't regret any of that major said when asked whether he regretted not having gone to a university thatcher described him this week as a man of the people and major has seemed truly happy being with them even eating dinner regularly at a nearby mcdonalds and other fast-food restaurants while foreign secretary and chancellor of the exchequer during major's years in parliament his wife norma 45, and their children elizabeth 19, and james 16, have lived in great stukeley in his constituency huntingdon in cambridgeshire north of london and he has come home on weekends norma major an expert cook and dressmaker prefers a quiet family life and seemed almost frightened tuesday as photographers and television crews thronged her and her husband she has been active in local huntingdon charities and in 1987 she published a biography of opera singer joan sutherland i am very fulfilled by domesticity and i don't feel ashamed or guilty about that she said doing her ironing to an operatic aria when her husband was named foreign secretary last year even more quoted on tuesday was her reply to another interviewer who asked in 1986 whether she thought her husband would ever become prime minister no she said that kind of thing doesn't happen to people like us major's point of view a look at the views of john major new leader of britain's conservative party he will succeed margaret thatcher as prime minister on the persian gulf there will be no difference in policy major said there is absolute unity that what has happened there is unforgivable and that it has to be reversed on the economy in the mold of margaret thatcher major is a rigorous free-marketeer who will follow her policies of selling nationalized industries and holding down government spending as chancellor of the exchequer he has kept interest rates high as part of the government's program to combat inflation currently at 10.9 he has said he would make some tax cuts in lower brackets on europe major will show more enthusiasm for european monetary union than thatcher did but he remains cautious he drafted a plan for a parallel currency that would be used in addition to the 12 national currencies as chancellor he took the pound into europe's exchange rate mechanism in october on local taxes major has pledged to review the unpopular per-capita poll tax which has become a major political liability for the conservative party but he has ruled out its abolition
