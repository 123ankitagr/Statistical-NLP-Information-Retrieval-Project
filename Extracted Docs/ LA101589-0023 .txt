RADIO DAYS : When KLOS-FM morning madmen Mark & Brian invited Barry White , the man with the most awesome basso profundo in show business , to do their show Tuesday , we knew something wild was bound to happen -- especially since the radio bad boys had been playing snippets of White 's hits on the show for weeks ( White also has a new album coming out called `` The Man Is Back '' ) . But people have joked about White 's rumbling baritone for years -- what new twist could we expect from the impish deejays ? Easy . They got White to go along with a goofy chemistry experiment -- they fed him a tankful of helium . Sounding like a cross between Flip Wilson and Prince , White playfully recited '70s-era lyrics ( `` Take off your brassiere , my dear . . . `` ) , saying with awe : `` You guys are crazy . '' Thanks to stunts like this , Mark & Brian have catapulted to the No . 2 position in the morning ratings , leaping past Power 106 's Jay Thomas and trailing only KIIS-FM 's resurgent Rick Dees .
