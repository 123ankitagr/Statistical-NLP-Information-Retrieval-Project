Is it possible to scare the holy geebees out of someone without the use of elaborate special effects , fake decapitations and gallons of make-believe blood ? It is , and it 's called `` The Haunting . '' This black-and-white gem , based on the late Shirley Jackson 's best-selling novel , `` The Haunting of Hill House , '' just may be the best supernatural movie ever made . You never even see the malevolent spirits . Director Robert Wise ( `` West Side Story , '' `` The Day the Earth Stood Still '' ) works the viewer 's imagination with chilling sounds , suburb cinematography , weird camera angles and dark and light shading . The plot is simple : An anthropologist ( Richard Johnson ) wants to prove once and for all that there are such things as ghosts . So he finds a 99-year-old haunted house in New England and enlists the help of two psychics -- Julie Harris and Claire Bloom ( talk about mega-casting ) -- and a wisecracking skeptic , played by `` West Side Story '' and `` Twin Peaks ' `` Russ Tamblyn . The viewer ends up with 112 minutes worth of sweaty palms , elevated blood pressure and just about everything a scary movie should deliver . A few suggestions : Watch it at night -- the later the better -- with the lights out . And , if possible , watch it with someone who does n't mind having his or her arms gripped . `` The Haunting '' ( 1963 ) , directed by Robert Wise . 112 minutes . No rating . ERIK HAMILTON
