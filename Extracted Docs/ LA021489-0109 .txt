The founder of Recruit Co. and three other businessmen were arrested in a stock-trading scandal that has shaken Japan 's governing party and contributed to its loss in a special parliamentary election . The opposition Japan Socialist Party , victorious in Sunday 's by-election , demanded that Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita resign or dissolve Parliament `` so the people can express their will '' about the Recruit scandal . Recruit reportedly sold thousands of unlisted shares of stock at bargain prices to politicians , their aides and other prominent people . The purchasers then profited when the stocks were publicly traded and skyrocketed in value . The four who were arrested were Hiromasa Ezoe , founder and former chairman of the information services conglomerate ; a vice president of a Recruit subsidiary and two former officials of Nippon Telegraph & Telephone , Japan 's largest firm .
