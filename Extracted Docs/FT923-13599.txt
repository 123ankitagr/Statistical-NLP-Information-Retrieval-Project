John Cutts , one of London 's growing corps of European corporate financiers , is moving shop again . Having helped build Samuel Montagu 's European corporate finance network , he is joining Chartered WestLB as managing director , corporate finance . The 41-year-old Cutts , who is fluent in German , French and Dutch , has not followed the traditional career path of most London merchant bankers . He started work as an engineering apprentice building Rolls-Royce aero engines in Derby , then sold telephone answering machines around Europe . But it was not until he graduated from the Insead management school that he realised he wanted to be something more than an engineer . He joined Amsterdam-Rotterdam Bank in the early 1980s and was involved in building up its mergers and acquisitions team . At the end of 1985 he moved to EBC Amro Bank to head its corporate finance department , and three years later switched to Samuel Montagu . His move to Montagu , the merchant banking arm of Midland Bank , was partly prompted by George Loudon 's appointment to the Midland Bank board in 1988 . Loudon , a Dutch man , and Cutts , who is half Austrian , had worked together at Amro . Samuel Montagu differs from many London merchant banks in having established a successful corporate finance network in various Continental centres , rather than servicing clients ' needs just from the City . Cutts wants to do the same again at Charter WestLB , a merchant bank jointly-owned by Standard Chartered and Westdeutsche Landesbank . Cutts knows Germany well , having been brought up in Dusseldorf , home of Westdeutsche Landesbank . Cutts joins Jan Bowlus , who was hired from Prudential-Bache Capital Funding two years ago . Bowlus , who is also a corporate finance managing director , will concentrate on developing and marketing corporate finance products .
