First Interstate Bancorp said Monday that it has agreed to sell Commercial Alliance Corp. , a subsidiary that finances the leasing of heavy equipment , to a Japanese firm for $ 190 million . First Interstate , parent of First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles , said the unit is being sold to ORIX Corp. of Tokyo because it does not fit with its main business of consumer banking in the West . In addition , First Interstate said , the sale will improve its ratio of capital to assets . Restructuring Strategy Commercial Alliance , based in New York , finances equipment that is leased by builders , trucking firms , commercial printers and other users of large equipment . The unit , with $ 1.9 billion in assets , has been a profitable business for First Interstate , earning $ 14.8 million in the year ended June 30 . The move to sell the subsidiary , which operates from 23 offices throughout the country , is part of a strategy that First Interstate announced in late 1987 to restructure and put more emphasis on consumer and corporate banking . Since then , it has sold about $ 4 billion in assets , not counting Commercial Alliance . First Interstate said ORIX is Japan 's biggest leasing company . The sale , which must be approved by Japan 's Ministry of Finance , is expected to be completed later this year .
