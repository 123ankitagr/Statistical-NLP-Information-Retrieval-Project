murder suicide plain old age the way cells die regarded for decades as an obscure byway of biology has become a subject of burning scientific interest researchers are stampeding into the study of cell death and american venture capitalists are racing after them eager to pour millions of dollars into biotechnology companies exploiting their work they see it as a new route to treatments for intractable diseases including cancer alzheimers and aids scientists have known for many years that billions of cells die every day even in the healthiest people to make room for new cells but they have only recently realised that all cells are programmed to perish by the same process in every part of the body from blood to brain and in all creatures from primitive worms to humans the process which has the evocative name of apoptosis from the greek word for the shedding of leaves is really cell suicide once apoptosis has been triggered a cell destroys itself within a few hours its membranes break down and enzymes split up the genetic material in the nucleus at the same time the main body of the cell shrinks and breaks up into small pieces which are eventually consumed by neighbouring cells although three edinburgh university cancer researchers andrew wyllie john kerr and the late alastair currie had discovered apoptosis in the early 1970s most biologists regarded it as no more than an interesting curiosity until the late 1980s they were more interested in the way cells divide and grow and how they respond to germs and drugs than in their suicidal behaviour the reason for all the excitement now is that research over the past five years has shown apoptosis to be a far more widespread phenomenon with much wider implications than anyone had suspected indeed it turns out that all cells are programmed to die in a clean and orderly way through apoptosis when their time comes the other way a cell can die is through necrosis a much cruder process of sudden and unprogrammed destruction following accidental injury burns poisoning asphyxiation or virulent infection apoptosis plays a particularly important role at the very earliest stage of life it shapes the developing embryo in the womb removing cells where they are not needed to take a simple example it leaves clear spaces between the growing toes of most animals but in water birds the level of apoptosis is reduced and webbing remains between the toes another vital function of apoptosis in embryonic development and then throughout life is apparently to maintain a natural selection process in the body what seems to be emerging from research is that the best cells are selected for development and unwanted cells are removed wyllie says the immune system depends on apoptosis to regulate the number of blood cells available to defend the body against invading germs someone infected with a new virus makes huge numbers of special cells to recognise and kill the invaders when the threat is over almost all the defenders commit suicide leaving just a few to remember the virus in case it invades again so apoptosis is essential for maintaining a healthy balance between the growth of new cells and elimination of old ones if the balance is lost disease results one of the first scientists to popularise the role of apoptosis in disease was luc montagnier the french discoverer of hiv he has been promoting for several years the idea that the virus causes aids by forcing too many tcells in the immune system to commit suicide too much apoptosis may also be a cause of degenerative brain diseases such as alzheimers indeed any apoptosis at all is bad news for the brain as its cells are the only ones in the body that do not renew themselves routinely in adult life too little apoptosis on the other hand results in the cell proliferation characteristic of cancer and the abnormal immune reactions responsible for rheumatoid arthritis hopes of intervening in the process and shrinking tumours for example by persuading their cancer cells to commit suicide rest on finding the genes that control apoptosis in the humble nematode worm caenorhabitis elegans a favourite subject for genetic research because of its simple structure robert horvitz and colleagues at massachusetts institute of technology have already identified 16 genes involved in apoptosis some of these are apparently related to human genes that may trigger or suppress cancer horvitz chairs the scientific advisory board of idun pharmaceuticals named after a nordic goddess who keeps apples bright and shining it is one of several biotechnology companies started recently in the us to commercialise apoptosis research others include apoptosis technology and lxr biotechnology the prospect of manipulating cell death to cure cancer or prevent degenerative brain disease may yet turn out to be an illusion but the existence of apoptosis companies shows that investors expect something to come of it within a decade or so
