Fierce opposition by Europe 's exporters to European Commission plans to harmonise medium- and long-term export credit insurance regimes will be voiced in Brussels today when a delegation representing Germany , Holland , Spain , France and the UK meets senior Commission officials , David Dodwell , World Trade Editor , reports from London . Proposals to limit bank credit cover will top a nine-point list of complaints about proposed changes . The Commission is planning to trim cover to 95 per cent of the proportion of an export contract 's value covered by export credit agencies . This contrasts with the UK practice of covering the full value of a buyer credit .
