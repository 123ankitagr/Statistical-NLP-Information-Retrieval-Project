significantly by 178 per cent than for any other performing art form over the past four years in the uk according to the arts council it is a more or less useless fact although borne out by the abundance of hot and cool jazz which can be heard on any night of the week in surroundings that vary from subterranean to postmodern this month you could have tracked the extraordinary harmonics of tal farlow the usuallyreclusive american guitar legend as he moved residencies from the east ends tenor clef to the beery back room of the bulls head in leafy barnes southwest london via sohos lowkey pizza express bass man peter inds tenor clef is the sedate room above his steamy basement bass clef club and restaurant jammed between bombsites and grimy dickensian warehouses the east end location gives a speakeasy atmosphere to a main room where the walls run wet with condensation on steamy salsa nights peter boizots pizza joints the express down the stairs in dean street and the more topshelf pizza on the park in knightsbridge near harrods are strictly for the supperclub set and a knife and fork accompaniment prevails the bulls head a regulars pub mixes youngs ale with modern mainstream sounds every night in its back room it is worth the long journey west to watch elderly middleclass beatniks hunched and shaking over their pints to the north in nw1 stranded amid the heaps of downandouts from europes biggest doss house is the financiallybeleaguered camden jazz cafe as farlow was making his way across town the cafe was playing postmodernist host to the abstract tenor of pharoah sanders by the river on the bunker walls of the south bank complex posters for the shiny technofusion of chick corea the most famous acolyte of scientology founder l ron hubbard vied for attention with the nordic blandishments of jan garbareks soprano but if london is on the circuit for the big names of jazz it also home to interconnected local scenes fed by homegrown talent and fuelled with beer emis famous blue note label has recognised the london effect and tomorrow night showcases six of the countrys most promising young musicians at the camden jazz festival the original compositions which be premiered in the technicssponsored event at the bloomsbury theatre will be recorded featured londoners tony remy guitar michael and mark mondesir bass and drums and orphy robinson vibes are easy to catch on the club and pub scene and that scene is not hard to find take stoke newington a superficially unremarkable part of northeast london inhabited by turks west indians orthodox jews meeja bohemians and jazz musicians a walk from our house to the high street will take you past one then another saxophone running through scales in competition with the rolling thunder

squealing sax beyond in church street is the vortex jazz bar an artists supply shop with an airy whitewashed loft open five nights a week to all schools of jazz from a john etheridge duo to the stan tracey octet take a left to newington green and by the china inland mission is the latin jazz cafe forerunner to the camden club a little further along is the weavers arms a friendly pub which resonates to the accordionled strains of zydeco swamp music which has become an incongruous but important part of the london blues scene a similar trail of pub and club can be followed into islington and on to neighbouring camden and kentish town across the river too all are safe and none has complex rules over cover charges you pay to get in and then buy as few drinks as you like unlike new york where the blue note club often kicks out the punters between sets or paris where only an actuary could fathom the relation between cover charges and drink prices the london scene does not of course stand up to close comparison with new york it does not have the history but only in london could you find such a great us brass man as art farmer in a school hall at university college school in hampstead where tea and sandwiches were served by the boys at halftime live music in london is not as exotic as paris where different musical cultures have happily collided since the war but only in
