NOBEL Industries , the Swedish chemicals group , yesterday reported a 51 per cent decline in profits after financial items , to SKr460m ( Dollars 76.6m ) for 1991 , a result substantially lower than the company 's forecast of SKr700m . The dividend , which was SKr0.75 in 1990 , will be passed this year because Nobel posted a loss of SKr5.08bn after extraordinary items . This was due to its involvement with Gamlestaden , the finance company which collapsed last summer after bad property loans exhausted its capital . Nobel was subsequently rescued by the state-owned Nordbanken , which has become the principal owner of the concern . Group sales fell by 6 per cent to SKr24.7bn , primarily due to the takeover of its Bofors armaments division by Swedish Ordnance . Nobel predicted that earnings after financial items would improve this year , although the operating results would probably remain weak . One reason for the fall in earnings last year was that income from portfolio investments dropped to SKr96m from SKr408m in 1990 . A programme to concentrate activities in a few core areas will continue , with Nobel recently having sold its consumer products division . Operating earnings for its adhesive and paints group , the company 's largest division with sales of SKr9.3bn , rose by 29 per cent to SKr315m . Although sales of chemicals for the pulp and paper industry rose by 28 per cent to SKr4.3bn , operating profits fell by 46 per cent to SKr121m due to heavy investment spending .
