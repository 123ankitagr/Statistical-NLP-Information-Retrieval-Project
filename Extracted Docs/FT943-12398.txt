The first summit meeting between Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Estonian President Lennart Meri will take place today in Moscow . Top of the agenda will be the promised departure of Russian troops from the former Soviet republic by the agreed date of August 31 . Russian diplomats yesterday talked down expectations of a breakthrough on another contentious issue , the residence and pension rights for 10,000 former Soviet military and security officers . But one told the news agency Interfax that the meeting 'may give an impetus to resolving many controversial issues ' . These include the dismantling of the nuclear submarine training base at Paldiski and Estonia's claim to two strips of territory recognised as Estonian by the 1920 Tartu treaty with Russia and now under Russian control .
