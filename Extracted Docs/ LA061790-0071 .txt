victor yingst is on the trail of a killer on florida's palm-shaded gulf coast he knows the stalker's methods by heart first the coconuts fall then the fronds turn a bright yellow and soon the tree is dead said yingst who has spent more than three years battling lethal yellowing disease for the lee county extension service after wiping out thousands of palms in the caribbean and southeastern florida the infestation is spreading into one of the last untouched regions for the majestic jamaican tall palm and other susceptible exotic species the insect-carried disease moving inland from beaches has agriculture experts fearing a recurrence of the palm die-offs in southern florida in the 1970 s tourism officials worry about a change in the tropical appeal of southeastern florida lethal yellowing is sort of like a fire yingst said if left unchecked it will spread farther and farther it could really rob this area of its special beauty although lethal yellowing has been studied for nearly 100 years there is no known cure but recently tree inoculations and plantings of resistant palms have helped somewhat to contain the disease caused by a cellular organism called mycoplasmas that lives on the palm fronds soft core trees usually die within three to six months after the first symptoms appear the earliest known reference to a coconut tree disorder was made in 1834 on grand cayman island by the late 19 th century scientists were examining lethal yellowing in jamaica where the coconut crop was a valuable export lethal yellowing jumped over to the florida keys in the 1950 s and moved onto the mainland near miami in 1971 currently the disease has claimed about 200,000 coconut palms and nearly 100,000 other species in florida as far north as jupiter about 80 miles from miami according to the university of florida in texas lethal yellowing has spread to date palms creating concern in the date-growing regions of arizona and california overseas the disease ranges from west africa across the caribbean to mexico's yucatan peninsula what you're left with is a trunk like a telephone pole that just rots until it eventually falls over it's really ugly yingst said as head of the lee county lethal yellowing control effort yingst has organized groups of residents and landscapers to monitor its progress and inject healthy trees with a tetracycline-based antibiotic also resistant palms such as the popular malayan dwarf variety are being planted around healthy coconut palms as a buffer sherry marinello who operates a landscaping service said she has inoculated about 1,300 trees in ft myers and ft myers beach where the disease was first spotted on the gulf coast to see a picture of what this place looked like two years ago and what it looks like now would shock you she said it's a serious problem that could really change the character of this place if it's not stopped
