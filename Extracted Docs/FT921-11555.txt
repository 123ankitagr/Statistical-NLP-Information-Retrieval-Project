particularly in motorway construction where the salt can destroy the concrete if it is allowed to eat into the pillars - hardly seems glamorous . But a technique devised in the US and commercialised in Australia could bring concrete coatings into an environmentally conscious world . Radcon No . 7 , which will be sold in the UK by Nationwide Protective Coatings , of Newton Abbot , Devon , is a water-based coating which sinks into the concrete surface and reacts with free calcium in the concrete to produce a hydrophoebic barrier . The coating is sprayed on to the concrete , where it becomes sticky . Then the surface is sprayed down three times with water at regular intervals . This starts the biological process . Additionally , if cracking occurs to the concrete due to thermal stress , the coating is washed into the cracks when it rains , so sealing the fissures .
