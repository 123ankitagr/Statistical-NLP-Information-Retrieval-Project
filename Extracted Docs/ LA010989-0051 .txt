ernie torres worried about his neighbors reaction to a large wooden peace symbol he hung in front of his northridge home last month as a christmas decoration he remembered the adverse response to a peace symbol he displayed in front of a canoga park house during the height of the vietnam war in those politically charged days the peace symbol meant you were member of the anti-war minority a commie torres said when i look back i'm surprised nobody burned down the house it was a very conservative neighborhood he added but that was then and this is now torres reasoned and even though times had changed hanging a large peace symbol could spark controversy i asked myself do you want to bring that age back those weren't the best of times he said but torres 46, hung the peace sign complete with lights to illuminate it at night to his surprise the response has been positive and his peace symbol still in torres front yard has served as the catalyst to some rather surprising events when one of torres sons an army private stationed at ft benning ga saw the huge peace symbol he wanted his picture taken next to it his mother karen torres eagerly shows visitors the photograph of her son in his dress uniform standing next to the peace symbol his arms stretched above his head and his fingers making the v peace salute they knew what it was one evening when the torres family forgot to light the symbol a trio of high school girls who said they were worried that the family had taken it down appeared at the door they knew what it was and said they loved it karen torres recalled they said that there were peace symbol earrings and peace symbol t-shirts it seems like there's a revival of the peace symbol it's neat the torres peace symbol even has had a calming affect on a cluster of dorms at cal state northridge across the street from the family's house i don't know what it is but since that thing went up everyone here seems to have mellowed out said david flinn a resident of the north campus complex maybe it was the christmas vacation maybe it was the holiday spirit but the peace symbol is still up and the mellowness is still here the only controversy generated by the torres peace symbol is a ongoing family debate over whether to leave it up or take it down daughter jill 17, and her high school friends want it to be a permanent front yard fixture they think it's cool she said whatever the final outcome torres said he is going to take his time making up his mind it went over so big if we take it down we're going to get a lot of protest he said with a laugh
