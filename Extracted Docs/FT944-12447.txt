for the australian mining industry the much feared era of mabo has begun without interrupting the long-standing trend of steadily increased production and export revenue mabo is the popular tag given to a watershed high court decision given legislative effect late in 1993 through the native title bill the bill which broadly gives australia's aboriginal people title to large tracts of the country had drawn dire predictions from the mining lobby mainly reflecting concerns about exploration and development access however in 1993-4 the industry has again overcome weak world demand historically low prices for many key commodities and unfavourable exchange rate movements marginally to lift export revenue to almost adollars 30 bn accounting for better than 35 per cent of the country's total export receipts figures from abare the federal government's commodities research arm show that australia's mineral exports have risen in all but one year of the past decade the latest total represents more than double the country's then record adollars 14.9 bn mineral exports in 1986 while this performance justifies the industry's world leader status demonstrating its inherent strength and diversity closer inspection reveals some weak spots which threaten to reduce momentum later this decade the industry acknowledges that the effects on production and revenues may not be felt for some years given the lead times involved in major projects but mining executives see mabo as part of a long term pattern of adversity which includes the rise of environmental issues compensation claims from landowners unfavourable tax treatment and vexatious litigation mr geoffrey ewing of the australian mining industry council amic says the mining industry has long been a leader in negotiating with aboriginal communities our argument is not with the concept of native title but with the way the bill produces an unwieldy system for exploration and development access mr ewing said any real influence on production and exports is obviously some years off in fact our annual financial survey due out later this year will probably show a lift in exploration spending in the latest year but our information is that the spending is mainly on what could be described as brownfields sites which are free of any native title claims the australian mineral industry's overall performance in the latest year was also distorted by near boom conditions in one commodity gold where export value rose by more than 26 per cent to adollars 5.42 bn masking some serious declines in other commodities gold's resurgence echoes its historical position as one of the main populators of fledgling antipodean colonies more than a century ago the metal's more recent australian history is scarcely less important to national fortunes from a position of decline in the 1970 s when many of the country's biggest mines faced closure and annual output ran at less than three tonnes australian gold production has rallied close to 250 tonnes in the current year ranking it third in the world after south africa and the us and new projects already under way mean that production will keep rising strongly barring a collapse in the all-too-volatile gold price mr robin widdup gold analyst with j b were son the australian stockbrokers told the financial times world gold conference in june that australia's annual gold production was likely to top 300 tonnes by the turn of the century vigorous exploration and new mine development has transformed the gold industry from the 1980 s picture of short life shallow oxide open pits to large long life mines in the 1990 s mr widdup said the 1990 s australian gold rush has seen geologists armed with new geochemical and geophysical techniques unearth a series of large new gold discoveries beneath sand cover this breakthrough in technology has lifted exploration expenditure and the rate of success shows no sign of slowing a group of 10 to 15 new mines should lift australian production by 40 to 50 tonnes over the next five years if gold fulfils these expectations it could replace coal as australia's number one export earner around the turn of the century gold's export jump in the latest year compared with a corresponding 5 per cent fall to just under adollars 7.2 bn for coal several other major australian minerals recorded solid export revenue gains in 1993-94 including aluminium up 5 per cent to adollars 1.82 bn and iron steel and ferroalloys up 22 per cent to adollars 1.4 bn but zinc exports fell 22 per cent to adollars 795 m sticking to a familiar pattern australia's higher overall export receipts were achieved despite markedly lower average commodity prices received abare's mineral export price index slumped from 99.7 to 91.9 over the year while the index of mine production rose from 105.2 to 107 australia is quite simply continuing to sell more minerals for less money the financial performance of its leading commodities companies remains volatile it's a habit that will prove hard to kick while the industry remains a price taker hostage to a small local market and heavily exposed to the vagaries of international trade
