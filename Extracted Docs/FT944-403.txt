sales fever is spreading to house insurance halifax the uk's largest building society last week announced cuts averaging 20 per cent for building cover since then evidence has grown of an escalating price war aa insurance which sells policies on behalf of 40 insurers yesterday said the average cost of house contents policies had fallen by more than 1 per cent since july it would have been greater if the 2.5 per cent insurance premium tax had not been imposed in october the aa's latest insurance price survey due for release early next year shows rates for building insurance policies dropping by about 2.5 per cent since july excluding ipt churchill insurance one of the new breed of direct insurers selling via the telephone and cutting out brokers commissions said its buildings policies were 7 per cent cheaper than a year ago contents premiums have fallen 2 per cent cornhill insurance which offers building and contents insurance yesterday announced that it was following halifax's lead in offering no-claims discounts on some household policies as well as discounts for older policyholders such signs are good news for consumers who in recent years have become accustomed to crime and bad weather leading to rapidly rising insurance premiums they are less welcome for shareholders who have seen profit forecasts cut for large insurance companies many of which have only recently returned to making healthy profits several factors are increasing competition most obviously fast-growing direct sellers such as churchill and royal bank of scotland's direct line are anxious to build market share in the home insurance sector but consumers are also becoming more price sensitive traditionally most structure and contents policies have been sold by building societies at the same time as mortgages more than half of people taking out combined policies for the first time continue to use this route according to a survey earlier this year by nop the polling organisation but the number of policyholders switching from one company to another currently about 10 per cent a year is increasing nop suggested worryingly for banks and building societies which in recent years have enjoyed healthy profits from selling insurance products about 21 per cent of switchers choose direct insurers such trends explain halifax's high-profile price cuts last week but building societies have another reason for examining the cost of insurance products they sell from next year treasury rules are expected to allow societies to underwrite as well as distribute insurance policies that will put pressure on the current system by which societies sell polices provided by composite insurers most of halifax home insurance products for instance are supplied by sun alliance there will be a big incentive for societies to cut costs and take a greater share of profits by becoming insurers in their own right certainly the scope for cutting household insurance premiums further is considerable over the past year insurance companies have benefited not only from higher premiums set in previous years but also from a dramatic fall in subsidence claims helped by wetter weather theft has fallen too while natural disasters have been infrequent computers allow insurers to assess risks more accurately enabling them to set premiums almost on a household by household basis for instance royal insurance says it uses all the characters of postcodes to judge likely claims typically insurance companies are this year reporting underwriting profits of about 20 per cent on household insurance premiums far higher than for most other insurance products profit margins are still higher when income earned by insurance companies from investing premiums is added building societies and brokers take another slice of the price paid by policyholders the size of that cushion illustrates the room for insurers cutting prices next year and still making a decent return you can halve the profit margin and it's still very exciting said mr john chester insurance expert at sg warburg but as they cut premiums insurers will have at least half an eye on the longer term household insurance policies have to make substantial returns most years because once in a while there is a large natural disaster resulting in big losses the uk has escaped lightly in recent years so there are insurance bargains to be had but good times cannot last for ever
