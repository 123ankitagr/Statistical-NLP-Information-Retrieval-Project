Citing insufficient evidence , prosecutors today declined to file assault charges against Axl Rose , lead singer for the heavy metal band Guns ' N Roses , who was arrested for allegedly hitting a woman neighbor over the head with a wine bottle . In lieu of the criminal charges , prosecutors scheduled an informal hearing at which both Rose and the neighbor will meet with a representative of the district attorney in an attempt to reach an agreement to ensure that no future confrontations occur . Rose , 28 , was arrested Oct. 30 at his West Hollywood condominium for allegedly hitting his neighbor , Gabriela Kantor , 37 , over the head with a wine bottle , authorities said . He was booked on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and was released on $ 5,000 bail . Sheriff 's deputies said Kantor and Rose had been involved in an ongoing dispute over the last few months about how loudly he played music in his unit . Since the incident , Rose has decided to sell his condo and move into a single-family home .
