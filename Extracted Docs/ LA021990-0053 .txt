Bone marrow transplants may cure many sufferers of beta thalassemia , a fatal illness of young adults brought on by a genetic defect that cripples the blood 's ability to absorb oxygen , according to new research . The technique , a radical procedure commonly used to treat some deadly forms of cancer , was pioneered as a thalassemia treatment in the early 1980s . It involves destroying all blood-producing cells and injecting new cells from a donor . But if the technique fails , the patient usually dies . In tests of 222 children under 16 who had the defect , Italian researchers led by Dr. Guido Lucarelli reported that 82 % were alive one year after the transplant , with most experiencing no complications .
