imported vehicles but receive vehicles from the so-called transplant japanese manufacturing operations this has all the earmarks of the pot calling the kettle black the us car makers view an imported car or truck as bad unless it's a captive import sold by one of the big three then it's good mr lee iacocca chrysler chairman and leader of the us auto industry's campaign to cut japan's trade surplus ignores the big three's own sales of japanese cars in his attacks on japan japan has the us auto industry targeted and they're not about to take us out of their gunsights he said on his return this
