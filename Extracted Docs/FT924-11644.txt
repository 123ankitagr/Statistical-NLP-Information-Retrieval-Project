emperor akihito of japan last night said he deeply deplored the suffering caused during the japanese army's occupation of china but fell short of issuing a formal apology at a state banquet in his honour in beijing however emperor akihito went further in atoning for japan's actions than his father hirohito the god-monarch who presided over japan during the second world war and who usually expressed his regret about the past on such occasions in the long history of the relationship between our two countries there was an unfortunate period in which my country inflicted great sufferings on the people of china emperor akihito said i deeply deplore this when the war came to an end the japanese people believing with a sense of deep reproach that such a war should never be repeated resolved to tread the road of a peaceful nation although the speech may satisfy the chinese government which is keen to encourage japanese investment in china it is moot whether it will satisfy public opinion the chinese have been schooled as a matter of government policy in japan's war atrocities in their country as many as 10 m chinese citizens are estimated to have been killed during the occupation which began with the manchurian incident in 1931 and ended with japan's defeat in the pacific war in 1945 museums have been erected in many parts of the country to glorify the communist party's resistance to the japanese invasion and to emphasise the brutality of its occupation the chinese government had allowed some citizens to agitate against japan in the run-up to emperor akihito's visit and has permitted publication of calls for japan to pay dollars 180 bn pounds 110.4 bn in war reparations despite waiving the right to seek them when normalising relations 20 years ago
