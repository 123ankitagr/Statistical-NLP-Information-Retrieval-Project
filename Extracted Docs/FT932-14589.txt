the world's top word processing package sells around 1 m copies a month with over 22 m sold to date is it word for windows perhaps or wordperfect or maybe wordstar no compared with this package these are small potatoes the top seller sells more than all three put together so which is the world's best-selling word processor the answer of course is windows write which comes free with every copy of microsoft windows i have been using write for a couple of months now and very impressed i am too all the basic functions are there word wrap cut and paste layout controls and the full range of windows fonts very similar in appearance to microsoft word for windows write only lacks word's heavyweight features for handling multipage documents and sophisticated page layouts for the two-finger typist who wants to produce basic letters memos and reports write is ideal and its simplicity makes it one of the easiest packages to learn but the computer industry despises the simple and applauds the complex so write is virtually ignored of those 22 m purchasers of windows i would be willing to bet that a high proportion have no idea that write exists let alone that they own a copy if there is a pc in your office which has been bought during the last two years there is a good chance that unknown to you windows write has been sitting there all the time perhaps you should take a look you will need some help to find your way around windows and write unfortunately the windows manual is difficult to use nor can i find any recommendable self-teach books few of them take write seriously the best of a mediocre bunch is robert cowart's mastering windows 3.1 sybex i have put together a brief tutorial to help you find out whether you have windows on your pc and how to get started on write i have assumed you are a non-mouse user so a mouse is not required by the way if you do not use windows you may believe that you cannot use it without a mouse not so in fact the key to becoming productive in windows is to forget the mouse and to master the keyboard commands just like a dos package a full set of these keyboard shortcuts can be found in appendix c of the windows manual 1 first check that you have windows start up the computer it should display c the c prompt type cdwindows and press enter if the screen now displays c windows you are in business 2 type win and press enter the windows screen appears headed file-options-window help 3 call up the window option by holding down the alt key to left of the spacebar and pressing w 4 use down arrow to highlight and select accessories 5 the 13 windows accessory programs paintbrush notepad etc appear write's icon is a quill pen use the arrow keys to highlight write press enter the heading write untitled appears over a file-edit-find menu you are now in windows write 6 bring up the file menu by pressing alt-f 7 press the right arrow six times to go through the other menus finishing at the help menu 8 now from the help menu option press right arrow once more you see an unexpected menu headed restore move etc it shows the all-important alt-f4 key which is rather like escape in dos there are also commands for varying the size of the screen maximise the write screen now pressing x 9 press alt-h for help and enter for contents press down arrow to list all the features of write look at the bottom one document help commands by pressing the tab key repeatedly and working your way down if you go too far shift-tab will take you back 10 exit from help by pressing alt-f4 you are now back at the blank file-edit-find screen at this point either start experimenting or use cowart chapter nine cut and paste in write is delightfully easy try this type three lines of text now move line one to below line three as follows move the cursor to the start of line one shift-down arrow to highlight line one shift-delete key to delete line one move the cursor to below line three shift-insert key to insert line one if you use a mouse you can accomplish most of the above by moving and pointer to the instruction you want and clicking the button you will find that the rest of write is similarly elegant and simple no wonder this is the world's best selling word processing package
