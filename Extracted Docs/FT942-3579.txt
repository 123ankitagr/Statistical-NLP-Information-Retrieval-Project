Meanwhile , another little environmental tiff seems to have been patched up at last . Britain 's environment secretary John Gummer was seen walking arm-in-arm into an Oslo hotel yesterday with his Norwegian counterpart , Thorbjoern Berntsen . Berntsen , it may be remembered , was the man who told a Norwegian election rally last August that Gummer was 'the biggest drittsekk I have met in my life ' . Attending a two-day international meeting to sign a UN deal on curbing acid rain , Gummer told reporters that he had no hard feelings - both were good friends again . Fortunately for Berntsen , the Norwegian electorate was spared the picture of him cuddling up to Norway 's number one environmental enemy . Conveniently , the state-owned TV and radio network was on strike yesterday .
