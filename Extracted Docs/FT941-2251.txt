sir peter birch's suggestion letters 11 march 1994 that rival financial institutions be allowed to distribute literature to building society customers takes the concept of direct mail to new extremes such customers might well feel that the fact that they have a mortgage or savings account with a particular society should be regarded as confidential information and thus unavailable for distribution to any organisation that feels it would like to know their names and addresses for its own commercial advantage there is however a more fundamental point mr birch draws a parallel between public companies and building societies but ignores a crucial difference building society customers have paid nothing for their membership rights it is not clear in equity why those customers that happen to have such rights at a time when a third party makes a bid for a building society should be entitled to a windfall gain the situation in a public company owned by individuals or institutions that have put up equity capital and who face the risk of loss as well as the possibility of profit is quite different mr birch apparently feels that building society boards are not accountable for their actions in fact building societies have no monopoly over the mortgage and savings markets as recent trends in market share show in today's climate if they do not offer the right product at the right time to the right customers they rapidly diminish in importance as customers take their business elsewhere uniquely among financial institutions building societies are required by their legislation to contact their members and gain their approval before moving into new business areas outside of their mainstream mortgage and savings activity moreover boards face their electorates at the annual general meeting each year over the past few years members of societies have been elected as directors without the backing of the existing board including a member of abbey national to its board when it was still a building society and this year has once again seen a hotly contested election at a large society building societies corporate governance is based on the principle of one person one vote votes are not for sale in the market place most of the shares in our large plc financial institutions are owned by other financial organisations the question of who is accountable to whom and how responsibility for that accountability is discharged within a relatively small group of organisations mostly based in the city of london is perhaps a more fruitful starting point for any investigation into issues of corporate governance than the building societies g r lister chairman the building societies association 3 savile row london w1
