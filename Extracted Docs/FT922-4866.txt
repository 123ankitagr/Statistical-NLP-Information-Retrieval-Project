peugeots chairman mr jacques calvet who said at the weekend he would like to run for french president in 1994 is the latest businessman to bid for high office like ross perot the texan billionaire aiming for the white house mr calvet is right wing but there the similarity ends mr calvet 61 is not a brash outsider with poorly formed policies but a calculating and wellinformed senior member of the french political and business elite mr calvets political ambitions are no surprise i am ready to put forward my candidacy even if i have one chance in a thousand of carrying it off he told guests at the french open tennis tournament he has often been tipped for ministerial office and can hardly open his mouth without attacking the socialists the japanese or the european commission to the despair of peugeot executives who wish he would apply more of his powerful brain to selling cars this time mr calvet has raised the stakes in what looks like a sensible bet that voters will support someone who shares rising general anxiety about loss of french sovereignty in the wake of the maastricht treaty on monetary and political union he could also be betting that voters are tired of the same old figures on the right the equivocal mr jacques chirac leader of the rpr gaullist party and former president valery giscard destaing the remote sphinxlike head of the centreright udf mr calvets articulate attacks on european federalism and the shortcomings of the maastricht treaty place him in line with a large rebel group in the rpr yet he is well out of line with the proeuropean mr giscard destaing who happens to be his former political boss if mr calvet really does follow his ambitions he could find himself standing against mr giscard destaing in a joint udf and rpr primary the socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential election is likely to be either mr jacques delors the commission president that would be a delicious confrontation or the equally proeuropean former premier mr michel rocard even if mr calvet turns out to be bluffing his declaration could well put pressure on the right to fight harder against the maastricht treaty still being ratified in france mr calvet has shown startling adaptability in his career educated at the ecole nationale dadministration the giltedged civil service college he was head of mr giscard destaings private office when the latter was finance minister from 1970 to 1974 later mr calvet joined banque nationale de paris the largest stateowned bank to become chairman only to be thrown out when the socialists came to power in 1981 the peugeot family asked him to help out at the car group a year later because it needed a strong manager who could turn round the near bankrupt company and fight off union attempts to have peugeot nationalised mr calvet did both with panache confronting the new socialist government headon with a heavy programme of peugeot job cuts at one point provoking riots outside a plant near paris the peugeot family made him chairman in 1984 and it is as a result of mr calvets toughness that the groups published net margins are now the best in the world car industry a handful of successors is now in place at peugeot he once said that one should not stay for much longer than 10 years in a job which would bring him neatly to 1994 a year before the elections
