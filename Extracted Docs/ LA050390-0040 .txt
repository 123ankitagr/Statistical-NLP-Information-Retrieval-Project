It has been a long time since El Capitan has won a Grossmont League baseball title . So long that El Capitan Coach Steve Vickery would rather not bring it up . But if his Vaqueros keep winning , he just might have to mention it . After a come-from-behind , 7-5 victory over host Granite Hills Wednesday , eighth-ranked El Capitan ( 16-7 , 4-0 ) needs to win just two of its final four 3-A league games to clinch its first Grossmont title since 1975 . Granite Hills ( 15-8-1 , 2-2 ) and Helix ( 13-8-1 , 2-2 ) are two games back . `` We 're just trying to take care of business right now , '' Vickery said . `` We want to put the pressure on somebody else . We 'll talk about what we 've accomplished June 10th at our banquet . '' If El Capitan does wind up as champion , a good topic of conversation might be the six-run sixth inning Wednesday . With El Capitan trailing , 3-1 , catcher Jeep Tharp tied it with his first home run of the season , a hit that cleared the center field fence some 370 feet from home . Two walks and an error by first baseman Rob Sharkey loaded the bases for ninth-place hitter Ryan Ransom , who grounded a single to right to score two runs . Sid Melero 's RBI single and Mike Farrell 's sacrifice fly scored the other two runs . El Capitan starter David Rios ( 7-1 ) allowed a two-run double to Granite Hills designated hitter Tom Koontz in the sixth . Rios , who was victimized by five errors , struck out four and gave up eight hits before he was replaced after six innings by Jason Reed . `` We kind of kicked the ball around early , but we kept ourselves in a position to win the game , '' Vickery said .
