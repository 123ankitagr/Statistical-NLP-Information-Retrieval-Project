sir conclusions drawn in your leader cars congestion and pollution november 20 were shared by a conference held in london last week which considered greater london's transport problems there was one important difference there was considerable agreement that road pricing is inevitable and other forms of constraint would be needed it was not however felt that there would ever be enough space for all the roads necessary in suburbs or towns it is therefore essential that alternatives are put in place which would allow for the adequate movement of people and goods by the time that such constraints come into full force the needs that were identified are first improved radial and cross-london services and second an orbital ring railway around london a ring railway would link the suburbs which now generate over 50 per cent of the total car traffic in greater london a further need is for local services such as light rail and tram links only with such facilities in place would there be opportunities to rationalise road traffic without serious harm to london's economy stefan b tietz s b tietz and partners 14 clerkenwell close london ec1r 0 pq
