Sir , Conclusions drawn in your leader , 'Cars , congestion and pollution' ( November 20 ) , were shared by a conference held in London last week , which considered Greater London 's transport problems . There was one important difference . There was considerable agreement that road pricing is inevitable and other forms of constraint would be needed . It was not , however , felt that there would ever be enough space for all the roads necessary in suburbs or towns . It is therefore essential that alternatives are put in place which would allow for the adequate movement of people and goods by the time that such constraints come into full force . The needs that were identified are , first , improved radial and cross-London services , and , second , an orbital ring railway around London . A ring railway would link the suburbs which now generate over 50 per cent of the total car traffic in greater London . A further need is for local services such as light rail and tram links . Only with such facilities in place would there be opportunities to rationalise road traffic without serious harm to London 's economy .
