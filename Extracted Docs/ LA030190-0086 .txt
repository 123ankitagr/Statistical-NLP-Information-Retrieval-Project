The City Council , concerned about reports of rent gouging , has asked a city commission , the city 's fair housing agency and a landlord group to study the problem and make recommendations . Edna Scott , fair housing coordinator for the Pomona Neighborhood Center , told the council that landlords are buying up slum property and raising rents drastically without making improvements . Tenants who refuse to pay the increased rents are being evicted , she said , adding that some are unable to find other shelter and are left homeless . The council , on a 3-2 vote , decided to ask the Community Life Commission , which oversees city housing funds , to meet with the Pomona Neighborhood Center and an apartment owners organization to consider the problem . Mayor Donna Smith and Councilman Mark A.T. Nymeyer voted against the action after expressing concern that the city might be headed toward rent control . Councilman C. L. ( Clay ) Bryant said imposing rent control would be a last resort . `` If we can possibly avoid rent control , I would lean hard in that direction , '' he said .
