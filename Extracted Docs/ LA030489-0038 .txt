According to Jason Berry in Opinion ( `` A Master Racist Jumps Parties to Land in the Louisiana Legislature , '' Feb. 26 ) , former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard , now Louisiana state legislator David Duke has learned the strategic necessity of political deception . His National Assn . of White People News advises that since the public regards white supremacy as immoral , racist activists should conceal their opinions and only talk about racial differences . Duke characterizes his group as a `` civil-rights organization . '' In the same section of The Times , former Reagan Administration war planner , now right-wing think-tank member Fred C. Ikle declares that the Reagan Administration had us on a fast road to democracy in Central America when the Congress interfered by stopping military funds for the Contras and now may even cut military funds for El Salvador ( `` Sell-Out in Central America , '' Op-Ed Page ) . Ikle is more circumspect than Duke , but if he were equally frank he might advise that since the public regards terrorism , death squads , and massacres as immoral , war advocates should be careful to speak only of the fast track to democracy .
