The United States is extending a program allowing certain foreign visitors into the country without a visa to include four more nations , the State Department announced . The entry privileges , granted under a test program running through 1990 , will now be given to citizens of France , the Netherlands , Switzerland and Sweden , State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said . Earlier this month , President Bush announced that Italians and West Germans would be able to enter the United States without visas under a pilot program . First authorized in 1988 for citizens of Britain and Japan , the program permits a visa-free stay of up to 90 days in the United States .
