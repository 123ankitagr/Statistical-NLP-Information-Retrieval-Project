striking regional variations are revealed by the first atlas of cancer incidence in england and wales published yesterday clive cookson writes the atlas commissioned by the cancer research campaign shows that lung cancer the most common form of the disease in men is much more prevalent in the north than in the south the reverse is true for breast cancer the most common cancer in women dr isabel silva and dr anthony swerdlow of the london school of hygiene and tropical medicine analysed information about 3m new cancer patients between 1968 and 1985 to give a countybycounty variation in cancer risks they compared these with the geographical distributions of risk factors such as smoking and occupation the figures in the map above are an index of the number of new cases in each county over the period in some cancers there is an obvious link with risk factors the northsouth gradient in lung cancer is caused mainly by the greater prevalence of smoking in the north the authors say that greater industrial exposures to smoke dust and toxic fumes in the north are not sufficient to account for the regional differences malignant melanoma the most virulent skin cancer has a strong southnorth gradient someone living on the south coast is three times more likely to suffer than someone in northern england there is a clear correlation with hours of sunshine the reason why breast and ovarian cancers are more common in the south is not obvious the fact that southern women have fewer children on average may be a partial explanation drs silver and swerdlow say because they have higher levels of the hormones related to these cancers atlas of cancer incidence in england wales oxford university press pounds 170
