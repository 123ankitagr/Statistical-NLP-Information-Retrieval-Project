the first step is to inject a mouse with a diseasecausing agent and extract antibodyproducing cells from its spleen these are fused in the laboratory with myeloma cancer cells to make hybridomas immortal antibodyproducing cells that grow and divide indefinitely in a fermentation tank one hybridoma can produce billions of clones all producing the same monoclonal antibodies such antibodies have occasionally been used on their own to activate the bodys natural cellkilling mechanism but researchers usually make them more lethal by linking them to a poison molecule or to a radioactive isotope
