The first step is to inject a mouse with a disease-causing agent and extract antibody-producing cells from its spleen . These are fused in the laboratory with myeloma ( cancer ) cells to make hybridomas - immortal antibody-producing cells that grow and divide indefinitely in a fermentation tank . One hybridoma can produce billions of clones , all producing the same monoclonal antibodies . Such antibodies have occasionally been used on their own to activate the body 's natural cell-killing mechanism . But researchers usually make them more lethal by linking them to a poison molecule or to a radioactive isotope .
