the first step is to inject a mouse with a disease-causing agent and extract antibody-producing cells from its spleen these are fused in the laboratory with myeloma cancer cells to make hybridomas immortal antibody-producing cells that grow and divide indefinitely in a fermentation tank one hybridoma can produce billions of clones all producing the same monoclonal antibodies such antibodies have occasionally been used on their own to activate the body's natural cell-killing mechanism but researchers usually make them more lethal by linking them to a poison molecule or to a radioactive isotope
