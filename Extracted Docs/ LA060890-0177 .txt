After a 40-year interval , the Library of Congress has decided to resume awarding a national prize for poetry . Librarian of Congress James Billington issued a statement that the award , to be called The Rebekah Johnson Bobbitt National Prize for Poetry , will be presented in October for the best book of poetry published by an American during 1988 or 1989 . The $ 10,000 prize is provided by Bobbitt 's family in her memory . Bobbitt , a sister of President Lyndon B. Johnson , worked in the library 's cataloguing department in the 1930s , where she met her husband , O. P. Bobbitt . The Bobbitt Prize is the first such award given by the library since it awarded the 1948 Bollingen Prize to Ezra Pound . Pound had been interned for his pro-Italian activities during World War II and was indicted for treason . Following that controversy , the library adopted a policy prohibiting the granting of awards or prizes .
