The Montebello Police Department , on the lookout for truck drivers who are breaking traffic laws , will soon begin special patrols of the city 's industrial areas . Capt . Michael Kight said four traffic officers recently received training from the California Highway Patrol in order to crack down on drivers who break the law by driving trucks on restricted streets or are committing other traffic violations . Montebello has several large trucking firms in its industrial area on the south side of town , and heavy truck traffic has prompted residents to complain about trucks that emit too much smoke or are disrupting peace and quiet in their neighborhoods . Kight said the officers will patrol periodically .
