the legislators indignant anger over a times poll which holds them in low esteem unethical and unproductive prompts me to write my first letter ever to the times part a jan 3-4 first of all i was not part of the state poll however it would be difficult not to come to the same conclusion as the poll when one reads almost daily in the newspapers so much about the corruption and indecision of the various legislators it could be argued that a few bad apples do not make the whole tree rotten or a single rose does not make spring but the extensive number of legislators names which are continuously in the news in a detrimental manner impair this legislative body as a crack can destroy a dam or a hole in a tanker can ruin a coastline perhaps i would not have written had not assembly speaker willie brown d-san francisco called the poll an absolute unadulterated lie what does he mean by such a statement does he mean that the people who put the poll together are liars or is he trying to say that the public is misinformed and does not know the true facts which incidently is not what he said or that the press publishes lies all the time so that the public is misinformed or does he not know what he means or if he does know what he means why is he unable to articulate his meaning accurately after all what he stated does not make sense since a poll does no more than reflect people's opinions brown's response just further reflects negatively on his image if the speaker of the assembly does not make any sense then perhaps we have a bigger problem than the poll indicated derrick a anderson santa ana
