The legislators indignant anger over a Times Poll which holds them in low esteem , unethical and unproductive prompts me to write my first letter ever to The Times ( Part A , Jan. 3-4 ) . First of all , I was not part of the state poll . However , it would be difficult not to come to the same conclusion as the poll when one reads , almost daily in the newspapers , so much about the corruption and indecision of the various legislators . It could be argued that a few bad apples do not make the whole tree rotten , or a single rose does not make spring . But the extensive number of legislators ' names , which are continuously in the news in a detrimental manner , impair this legislative body as a crack can destroy a dam , or a hole in a tanker can ruin a coastline . Perhaps I would not have written had not Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ( D-San Francisco ) called the poll `` an absolute , unadulterated lie . '' What does he mean by such a statement ? Does he mean that the people who put the poll together are liars ? Or is he trying to say that the public is misinformed and does not know the true facts , which , incidently , is not what he said . Or that the press publishes lies all the time so that the public is misinformed ? Or does he not know what he means ? Or if he does know what he means , why is he unable to articulate his meaning accurately ? After all , what he stated does not make sense since a poll does no more than reflect people 's opinions . Brown 's response just further reflects negatively on his image . If the Speaker of the Assembly does not make any sense then perhaps we have a bigger problem than the poll indicated . DERRICK A.
