The Camarillo City Council will consider new guidelines today for motion picture filming and farmers markets . The changes to the city 's zoning ordinance for film permits have been requested to conform to state law , according to a California Film Commission official . `` The law attempts to standardize filming permits in California and cut through bureaucratic red tape , '' Michael Walbrecht said . Cities are asked to adopt a process for granting film permits or tell the California Film Commission why they do not want such a permit process . Only a few requests a year are received by Camarillo for filming permits . `` What the state is mandating , we 've been doing all along , '' said Tony Boden , director of planning and community development . In addition , the council will consider permits for farmers markets . Only growers who have been certified by the county 's agricultural commissioner will be allowed to participate in the market .
