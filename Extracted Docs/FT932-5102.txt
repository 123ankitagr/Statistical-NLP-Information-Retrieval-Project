CANADIAN Pacific Forest Products , the North American pulp and paper group , plans to spin off its western Canada wood products business into a new publicly-held subsidiary . The new unit is Pacific Forest Products , which will make an initial public offer of 10m common shares through an underwriting group led by Burns Fry , Scotia McLeod and RBC Dominion Securities . Pacific Forest will take over CPFP 's western saw-mill operations . CPFP , which is owned by the Canadian Pacific transport and resources conglomerate , will retain a voting majority in Pacific Forest . Pacific Forest had pro-forma 1992 sales of CDollars 173m ( Dollars 138m ) and operating profits of CDollars 22.9m . A preliminary prospectus has been filed for the public issue and the terms will be set by mid-July . Tioxide Canada , an affiliate of ICI of the UK , will pay a CDollars 4m fine for allowing a titanium pigment plant near Montreal to pollute the St Lawrence river . It is the highest environmental fine imposed in Canada for pollution . Mr Guy Martin , head of Environment Canada 's investigations division in Quebec , said he was happy with the outcome . 'The court recognised it is criminal to pollute , ' he said . The CDollars 4m penalty will be used mainly to restore wildlife habitat on the St Lawrence south shore .
