Peugeot Talbot , the UK subsidiary of PSA Peugeot Citroen , the French carmaker , suffered a pre-tax loss of Pounds 8.7m last year compared with a profit of Pounds 10.2m in 1992 . The company 's profitability declined steeply during the deep recession in the UK car market with pre-tax profits collapsing from a peak of Pounds 123m in 1989 . It said it had been hit last year by a 50.2 per cent fall in exports to 26,353 as a result of depressed demand in continental European markets . Its financial performance had also suffered from the impact of the devaluation of the pound against the French franc , which had raised the cost of imported components and had increased its selling costs . Exchange rate losses last year totalled Pounds 14m , the company said . Peugeot increased its new car registrations in the UK , however , by 15.1 per cent to 142,714 , which helped to raise turnover by 7.7 per cent to Pounds 1.64bn . As a result of the sharp fall in exports , production at its assembly plant at Ryton , Coventry declined by 15 per cent to 72,868 against 85,728 a year earlier . Output peaked at 116,505 in 1990 . The company was forced to cut its workforce and reduce production at Ryton to only one model last year , the 306 small family car , as falling sales in west Europe ended UK output of the Peugeot 405 . The French carmaker decided to concentrate production of the 405 at one of its main assembly plants at Sochaux in eastern France . The Ryton plant worked at only 65 per cent of capacity in 1993 and production is currently about 1,600 a week compared with full capacity of 2,600 a week . The Peugeot Talbot workforce was cut by 5.7 per cent last year to 5,889 at the year end . The PSA Peugeot Citroen group suffered a net loss last year of FFr1.4bn ( Pounds 160m ) .
