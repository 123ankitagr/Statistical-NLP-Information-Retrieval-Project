A federal grand jury indicted Charles Lewis , the central figure in an investigation of alleged drug activity at a downtown hotel room frequented by Washington Mayor Marion Barry , on charges of cocaine possession and perjury . Lewis , also a key player in a controversial joint Washington , D.C.-Virgin Islands personnel project , was indicted on three counts of cocaine possession and seven counts of lying to the grand jury . Barry became the focus of intense media interest when police , on their way to question Lewis in his Ramada Inn motel room Dec. 22 , were inexplicably diverted when it was learned the mayor was in the room with Lewis . The mayor has denied any knowledge of drugs in the room and was not named in the indictment . The mayor has offered little explanation of the visits , referring to Lewis only as `` someone I know . ''
