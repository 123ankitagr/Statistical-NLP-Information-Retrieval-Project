Surgeons at University Medical Center in Tucson have performed what they said is history 's first coronary bypass on a heart transplant recipient . Marjorie J. Rorabough , 59 , received a new heart in a transplant in 1979 and Dr. Jack G. Copeland determined on New Year 's Eve that a double bypass was necessary to help her cope with `` life threatening '' heart disease , said Jan Rooney , director of news communications for the hospital . Rorabough , of Loma Linda , Calif. , was in critical but stable condition after the 7 1/2-hour surgery , Rooney said . Rorabough is the longest survivor among the 125 people who have received heart transplants at the medical center .
