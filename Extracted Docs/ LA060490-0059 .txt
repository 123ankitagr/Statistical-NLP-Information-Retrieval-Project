An advisory panel will recommend to Congress next month the use of foreign aid to curtail illegal immigration from parts of Mexico , Central America and the Caribbean , according to a New York Times report . The 12-member Commission for the Study of International Migration and Cooperative Economic Development , headed by Diego Asencio , a former ambassador to Brazil and Colombia , concluded that some U.S. trade policies , such as import quotas , had the unintended effect of retarding foreign economic growth and encouraging illegal immigration . The panel 's report will also call for a free-trade agreement between the United States and Mexico such as the one signed in 1988 between the United States and Canada .
