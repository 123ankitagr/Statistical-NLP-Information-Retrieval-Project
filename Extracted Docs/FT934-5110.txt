The chancellor 's addition of Pounds 200m to export credit insurance cover for capital exports in 1996-97 , and a cut in the cost of premiums for certain markets , was yesterday welcomed by exporters as ' a step in the right direction ' . Credit cover from the Export Credits Guarantee Department , the government agency responsible for medium and long-term insurance cover , will rise from Pounds 3bn in 1995-96 to Pounds 3.2bn in 1996-97 . This is in addition to provision in October of extra short-term export insurance cover worth Pounds 1.4bn for the remainder of 1993 in a move aimed at protecting Britain 's export drive in fast-growing markets , particularly in the Pacific rim . 'In that this additional cover gives more headroom , it is most welcome , ' said Mr Campbell Dunford , chairman of the London Chamber of Commerce's export committee . He was encouraged by ' a gathering awareness ' of the importance of exports . Premiums for credit cover for exports to Argentina , India , Mexico , Poland , Slovakia and Turkey are to be cut by 'up to 20 per cent ' . This move has also been welcomed , though exporters complained that rates to markets such as Argentina and Poland have in the recent past been up to three times more expensive than other export credit agencies .
