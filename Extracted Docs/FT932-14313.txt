us attorney general janet reno said last night she asked question after question before giving the go-ahead for the fbi action which ended in the fiery suicide of religious cult members in waco texas obviously if i thought the chance was great of mass suicide i would never have approved the plan ms reno said the deaths confronted ms reno with a crisis just a month after being sworn in as the first woman attorney general in the us the crisis appeared to set the seal on the expected replacement of the embattled fbi director mr william sessions i approved the plan and i am responsible for it ms reno said ms reno said the fbi plan had been part of a coherent and continuing effort to bring a peaceful end to the 51-day siege of the cult group's compound the plan was gradually to compress the perimeter of the compound she had discussed and questioned the details with various experts over the last week ms reno said president bill clinton had been mindful of the mass suicide of a religious group in guyana in 1978 the emphasis in washington had been on achieving a peaceful resolution ms reno said i advised the president but i did not advise him of the details when a reporter asked whether there was an effort to shield mr clinton from any blame she said i'm accountable the buck stops with me however there will be much second-guessing now by politicians in washington mr clinton was told of the plan and approved it although the justice department had operational control there may be questions about whether the fbi's moves to ram holes in the religious group's bunker and to throw tear gas into the holes were not an attempt to do more than shrink the perimeter of the compound if today was not to be the day for final action as ms reno indicated to the press but just an attempt to force the cult members into an ever smaller area this appeared hard to reconcile with the broadcasting of directions over a loudspeaker about how to surrender the fbi spokesman mr bob ricks said our desire was to get them out of there in a non-lethal systematic manner he added i have no doubt that our plan was correct the fbi had acted with bravery even refusing to return fire coming from the cult members he said one fbi agent even left his vehicle to grab a burning woman and take her against her will to safety although he voiced regrets anger appeared mr ricks uppermost emotion the cult leader 33-year-old david koresh had lied as his last act telling the fbi before the inferno that group's children were safe in underground bunkers instead there were upstairs in the compound we hoped the women would grab their children and flee out he said in fact he said there were reports that the children may have been given poison or injections to quieten them the fbi's tear gas had absolutely nothing to do with the suicide he said it was the cult leader who gave the order to commit suicide he played the game mr ricks said he never intended to come out he wanted to kill some fbi people first in waco the blaze left the cult compound a smouldering ruin a grim testimony to mr koresh's claims to be a new messiah come to warn the world that its end was near in the eyes of fbi spokesman ricks mass suicide was what koresh wanted all along
