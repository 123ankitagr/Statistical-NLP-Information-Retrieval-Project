Retired Cincinnati Reds catcher Johnny Bench , who will be inducted into baseball 's Hall of Fame in July , said that if it is demonstrated that Reds Manager Pete Rose bet on baseball , he should not be permitted a place in the Hall . In an interview published today in the Cincinnati Enquirer , Bench said he wants to believe that Rose did not bet on baseball games . `` If he bet on baseball games and games that he participated in , then , no , he should not be in the Hall of Fame , '' Bench told the newspaper . `` If it 's anything else , then it should not take away from what he accomplished on the field . No one can question what he did on the field . '' Rose , 47 , a Cincinnati native who holds 19 major records including all-time career hit leader with 4,256 hits , has said he considers himself to be a Hall of Fame player .
