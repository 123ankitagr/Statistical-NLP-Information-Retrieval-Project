Cleveland High football Coach Steve Landress scripted Cleveland 's first few series of plays Friday night when his club played host to Fairfax in a nonleague opener . But his players suffered from opening-night jitters and fell , 21-7 , as Fairfax scored three fourth-period touchdowns . `` The script worked for the first series and then it broke down , '' Landress said . `` Back to the drawing board . '' Cleveland appeared to be in command after two periods , leading , 7-0 , while holding Fairfax to 43 yards and two first downs . But the Lions roared in the fourth quarter . After forcing David Erhardt to punt from his own seven , Fairfax took over at the Cavalier 41 , and four plays later , quarterback Rahim Muhammad tossed a 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Eduardo Payan . Milo Bynum 's kick tied the game at seven with 10:43 to play . Erhardt , who doubles as the Cavalier quarterback , fumbled a fake pitch on Cleveland 's next series . The Lions took the lead by using the hook-and-ladder play , as Muhammad threw a three-yard pass to Bynum , who turned and pitched to Tharen Todd , who went 34 yards for a touchdown . Fairfax scored again with 1 minute 44 seconds left when Muhammad went 56 yards on a quarterback sneak . Cleveland stayed primarily on the ground in the first half , moving the ball effectively but scoring only once . The Cavaliers took over at their 38-yard line after a Mario Mattison fumble and Erhardt threw 12 yards to Manny Valencia to put the ball at midfield . A two-yard gain by Ibn Bilal and two Erhardt completions moved the ball to the 21 , and Delvon McDaniel took over from there , carrying the final four plays of the drive and scoring on a five-yard run . Brent Sapiro added the kick . McDaniel led all rushers at halftime with 56 yards in 11 carries and finished with a team-high 60 yards . Erhardt , forced to improvise all night under a hard rush , was nine of 15 for 56 yards .
