I am writing in response to Gerald Peary 's March 4 article on the movie `` The Handmaid 's Tale . '' I was appalled by his embracing of stereotypes of fundamentalist Christians . Of course there are extremist and hypocrites in all religions , but what this movie does is depict fundamentalist Christians as tantamount to Nazis . American media would not tolerate doing this to any other religion or race . T. SOLLIDAY South Pasadena
