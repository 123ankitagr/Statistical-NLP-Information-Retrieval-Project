Regarding your June 11 Viewpoints column , `` Should Defense Firms Switch From Swords to Plowshares ? `` : Having done some business with defense contractors , I know that retraining workers on the production line is not a problem . That 's a matter of a few weeks at most . The problem is in feather-bedded management . How is somebody going to learn to be competitive in the marketplace on a fixed-price item ? In civilian production , cost overruns are not forgiven or accommodated . Cost overruns mean bankruptcies . Universities should gear up to teach executives how to get along with fewer people , how to cut salaries , including their own , and how to motivate workers to do quality work and fire those who do n't do the job . If universities are unprepared to teach courses like these because the professors lack the background , they can enlist qualified instructors from the world of small business entrepreneurs .
