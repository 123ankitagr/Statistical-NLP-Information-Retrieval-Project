An unarmed 15-year-old was shot and wounded early Thursday by a Los Angeles police officer in a confusing incident that began when the youth fled after mistakenly thinking a police helicopter was chasing him . The youth ignored commands to halt and then appeared to rush at an officer , officials said . The youth was identified as Eric Davis , who was shot once in the lower body . He underwent surgery at UCLA Medical Center and was in serious condition , a hospital spokesman said . The shooting took place at 12:25 a.m. near the Mid-City apartment building where Davis lives , shortly after police responded to a report of a car being burglarized on Venice Boulevard near Rimpau Boulevard , authorities said . Police said Davis and a 15-year-old companion heard the helicopter and mistakenly believed it was after them for selling cocaine . Officers Theodore McHenry , 31 , and Alicia Handy , 26 , who were searching for car burglars , both fired shots when the youth came toward them `` with both hands near his front waist band area , '' LAPD spokesman Don Lawrence said . Investigators were not sure Thursday which officer shot Davis .
