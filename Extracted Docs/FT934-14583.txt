CHINA 'S largest steelmaker , Anshan Iron and Steel Complex ( Angang ) , has signed a joint venture agreement with Perth-based Portman Mining to develop an iron ore mine at Koolyanobbing in Western Australia , writes Nikki Tait . Koolyanobbing was closed by Broken Hill Proprietary in 1982 , but the aim is to redevelop the mine by July next year . Angang will buy all iron ore fines produced at Koolyanobbing - estimated to average around 1.1m tonnes a year - for the next 20 years . The joint venture will take over low-grade stockpiles left behind when BHP closed its iron ore operations on Cockatoo Island , off northern Western Australia . Angang will also buy the concentrate from Cockatoo Island for the six years of this project .
