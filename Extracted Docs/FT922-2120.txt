europe's air traffic may suffer meltdown this summer with pilots and aircraft stranded in the wrong airports because of too much demand for airspace a senior official of the international air transport association iata warned yesterday mr norman jackson the technical director said it doesn't take much of an industrial problem or technical hitch to cause serious disruption iata said there already had been such troubles this year a british airways flight from london to paris had to turn back as a result of a power failure at a brussels air traffic control centre iata's warning came after its report earlier this month on congestion to eurocontrol the brussels-based government-backed air safety group it concerned the crisis on may 22 when air traffic management over europe reached breaking point flights were delayed three times as much as usual the two organisations are working together to establish an improved air traffic control system but that will not be in place until 1995-96 mr jackson said that until then airspace would have to be rationed and rationing translates into delays for passengers the warning highlights the growing difficulties in european air traffic over recent years which was interrupted only last year when passengers avoided air travel because of the gulf war the recovery in european air traffic this year has been faster than many in the industry forecast said mr jackson and is now higher than it was in 1990 this summer will not be the end of it he said
