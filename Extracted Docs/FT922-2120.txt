EUROPE 'S air traffic may suffer 'meltdown ' this summer with pilots and aircraft stranded in the wrong airports because of too much demand for airspace , a senior official of the International Air Transport Association ( Iata ) , warned yesterday . Mr Norman Jackson , the technical director , said : 'It does n't take much of an industrial problem or technical hitch to cause serious disruption . ' Iata said there already had been such troubles this year : a British Airways flight from London to Paris had to turn back as a result of a power failure at a Brussels air traffic control centre . Iata 's warning came after its report earlier this month on congestion to Eurocontrol , the Brussels-based , government-backed air safety group . It concerned the crisis on May 22 when air traffic management over Europe 'reached breaking point ' . Flights were delayed three times as much as usual . The two organisations are working together to establish an improved air traffic control system , but that will not be in place until 1995-96 . Mr Jackson said that until then , airspace would have to be rationed , and 'rationing translates into delays for passengers ' . The warning highlights the growing difficulties in European air traffic over recent years , which was interrupted only last year when passengers avoided air travel because of the Gulf war . The recovery in European air traffic this year has been faster than many in the industry forecast , said Mr Jackson , and is now higher than it was in 1990 . 'This summer will not be the end of it , ' he said .
