CSR , the Sydney-based building products and sugar group , is investing ADollars 45m ( USDollars 32m ) in a new Chinese joint venture which will supply pre-mixed concrete in northern China . It is the first time the Australian company has made a major commitment to the Chinese market , and its largest foray into Asia to date . At the outset , CSR will have a 63 per cent interest in the joint-venture company , to be called CSR Tianjin Readymix , with the government-controlled Tianjin Building Materials Supply General Corporation holding the minority interest . The Australian company will make an initial investment of ADollars 23m . However , when a second stage of the expansion programme is completed in approximately three years ' time , CSR 's stake will have risen to 75 per cent , and its total investment is expected to amount to ADollars 45m . The joint venture , to be managed by CSR , will operate a large aggregate quarry and construct four pre-mixed concrete plants close to Tianjin , an industrial centre in northern China and about 140 kilometres south-east of Beijing . It is scheduled to start supplying the market with concrete - most of which is currently mixed on site in northern China , according to CSR - in August this year . Within the three-year time-frame , sales are forecast to top ADollars 70m , and production should top 750,000 cubic metres of concrete a year . Output from the quarry is expected to treble to 3m tonnes a year . About 125 concrete trucks should be operational . CSR is understood to have other Asian projects under consideration . It recently reached a joint venture agreement to build and operate a ADollars 29m concrete products factory in Taiwan .
