An arbitrator ruled Wednesday that the Atlanta Braves released outfielder Albert Hall because of his poor play , not because he admitted to having a drug problem . Arbitrator George Nicolau , who heard the case last month , said : `` Hall was properly released under ( terms of ) the uniform players ' contract . The club 's decision was made in good faith and was not improperly motivated and the commissioner 's drug abuse program did not prohibit the club 's action . '' Hall , 30 , admitted to having a drug problem at the start of spring training . He completed a drug rehabilitation program March 22 and was released by the Braves six days later -- just before the deadline for releasing a player without having to pay his entire salary . The Major League Players Assn . filed a grievance , claiming that under the commissioner 's policy , players who come forward and admit having drug problems may not be released . Hall had a .254 batting average , five home runs and 64 stolen bases in eight major league seasons .
