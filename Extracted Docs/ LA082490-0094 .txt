Residents of the city of Los Angeles seeking to slow the flow of traffic through their neighborhoods had better prepare themselves for long waits . At a special meeting of top officials in the city 's Department of Transportation on Thursday , Mayor Tom Bradley decried the red tape delaying installation of crosswalks and traffic signals . It takes 198 days just to consider requests for new traffic signals downtown , Bradley said . Slow as that seems , it 's better than in West Los Angeles , where bureaucrats ponder such requests for 267 days . In the San Fernando Valley , requests for new traffic lights take 225 days to be decided upon . And in the East San Fernando Valley , the department takes 272 to study requests for a crosswalk . `` These kinds of delays are unacceptable , '' Bradley said . `` I do n't know what the reason is . I hope you do n't tell me you need more personnel . '' In an effort to reduce the delays , Bradley said he will hold similar meetings in the future and demand monthly or quarterly reports from transportation officials . The people of Los Angeles , he said , should n't be told `` it will take eight or nine months '' to review a crosswalk .
