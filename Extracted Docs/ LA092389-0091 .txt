Security Pacific Corp. said Friday that it will combine its three credit-card processing facilities , including one in Glendale , and move them to a new site in Arizona . The Glendale credit-card operation is the largest of the Los Angeles banking company 's three centers , employing 420 people . Security Pacific has another in Seattle , which employs 200 people . The smallest one employs 61 people in Phoenix . A Security Pacific spokeswoman said all of the current employees will be offered jobs at the Phoenix center . She added that an effort will be made to find jobs elsewhere in the company for Glendale and Seattle employees who choose not to move . If other jobs can not be found , she said , employees will receive severance benefits . The credit-card facilities operate 24 hours a day , processing transactions for purchases made with MasterCard and Visa credit cards issued by Security Pacific . The three facilities combined handle 1.5 million accounts with total balances of more than $ 1.5 billion . Security Pacific , parent of Security Pacific National Bank , disclosed in April that it was considering combining the three facilities into one as a major cost-saving measure . Security Pacific now has three centers because it acquired banks in Arizona and Washington that had their own processing facilities . To Start by Year-End Security Pacific said it also considered sites in California , Oregon , Nevada and Washington . It said Arizona was selected because workers are plentiful , operating costs are expected to be lower and because various laws and regulations there are less strict than in some other states , such as California . The banking company said it expects to start consolidating the facilities by the end of the year .
