leo mullin the 50-year-old harvard-educated banker recently named as president of first chicago corporation has thus become heir-apparent to first chicago chairman richard thomas the engineer of a remarkable turnround over the past two years at the us's eleventh largest bank writes laurie morse mullin's first task will be to convince wall street and the ranks of first chicago's institutional bankers that despite his history as a retail banker he will maintain the bank's successful balance of retail and global corporate banking activities first chicago after a decade of mishaps and disappointing returns is now profitable and poised for growth mullin's promotion not only paves the way for an orderly succession to thomas who must retire in 1996, but suggests that the bank plans to expand through retail bank acquisitions mullin came to first chicago 12 years ago as a strategic planner and ended up directing the corporation's retail banking activities he has plenty of experience of producing healthy businesses out of turnround situations he is credited with preserving first chicago's credit card portfolio in the early 1980 s a loss-maker at the time the credit card division is now one of the bank's biggest profit centres before joining first chicago mullin spent nine years at mckinsey where he helped forge conrail out of a handful of failed eastern freight carriers mullin claims he fully understands the bank's balance of business my job is to develop a strategy for the entire corporation he says we have as much upside in corporate banking as anywhere else still he is keen to keep first chicago a leader in its home market barely a week after his promotion first chicago announced it would acquire lake shore bancorp a local institution with dollars 1.2 bn in assets and headquarters on chicago's posh michigan avenue for dollars 323 m in stock first chicago's share price fell after the deal which analysts viewed as pricy however mullin says the purchase makes strategic sense and that first chicago should grow aggressively in all its divisions
