A Los Angeles man who hired a helicopter pilot in a failed attempt to fly his brother out of a federal prison in Florida pleaded guilty in Miami Wednesday to conspiracy charges in connection with the unsuccessful escape attempt , authorities said . Marc Kramer , 30 , hired the pilot in April to fly into the exercise yard at the federal correctional center in Miami and pick up his brother , Benjamin Barry Kramer , who was awaiting trial on drug smuggling and money laundering charges , federal prosecutors said . The inmate boarded the aircraft , but the helicopter crashed after its blades became entangled in a security fence as it tried to take off . Benjamin Kramer , who was injured in the crash , faces trial later this year on the escape charges , prosecutors said .
