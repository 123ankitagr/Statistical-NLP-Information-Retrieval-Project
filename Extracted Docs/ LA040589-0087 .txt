Three of the four Arizona freshman football players arrested last month in connection with a series of campus assaults have been suspended from the school for two years and a fourth has been put on probation , the university 's dean of students said Tuesday . Rosalind E. Andreas said that the three players must decide this week whether to accept or appeal the sanctions . She would not name the suspended students , but four players -- offensive lineman Michael Bundy , defensive back Samuel Edwards , quarterback Sean Hutson and walk-on wide receiver Jeffrey King -- were arrested March 9 and charged with misdemeanor assaults . The players were accused of a series of random attacks in which 11 people were beaten during a two-hour period . Several were treated at hospitals for bruises and black eyes , and at least one was treated for a broken nose , police said .
