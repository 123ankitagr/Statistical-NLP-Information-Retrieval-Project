Three new City Council members were sworn into office on Tuesday . Their arrival will end months of deadlocks that divided a four-member council . Leslie Ann Pontious , a travel agency owner , Jim Potts , a police sergeant , and Charles E. Puckett , a district sales manager , fill seats on the council that were previously occupied by Ursula E. Kennedy , John Kelly and Ronald B. Hoesterey . Hoesterey resigned in November , leaving the two years of his office that will be completed by Potts . Kennedy chose not to run again and Kelly was ousted in last week 's election . The new council voted unanimously to retain Richard B. Edgar as mayor and chose Pontious to replace Kennedy as mayor pro tem . Edgar has held the post since November and several other times .
