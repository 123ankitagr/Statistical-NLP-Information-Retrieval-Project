question my soninlaw is a real jock who is now in training for a triathlon but he never works out in the morning because he says that most heart attacks happen at that time and he doesnt want to take a chance my question has to do with what he says about the timing of heart attacks what logical reason can there be for heart attacks to happen more in the morning than at any other time of day if anything i would expect that more attacks would take place at night after a hard days work answer there is substantial evidence that more heart attacks occur between 6 am and noon than at any other period of time during the day furthermore the initial symptoms have been reported to appear usually within the first four hours after the person awakens in the morning why heart attacks occur so often in the morning is still to be explained one physician who has been studying this phenomenon suggests that the incidence of heart attacks is related to the time after awakening but the specific association has yet to be determined
