when asked to name the commonest cancer in men under 45, most people get it wrong i concluded at a recent dinner party my question killed the conversation dead but it highlighted the importance of testicular cancer one man in 450 will develop this cancer before the age of 50 and more than 1,400 new cases are diagnosed in the uk every year the incidence is even higher in other northern european countries notably denmark germany switzerland ireland and luxembourg testicular cancer is generally treated with a combination of surgery and chemotherapy with great success sterility is the rule for a year or two after treatment but the long-term outlook is excellent around 95 per cent recover completely and many father children unfortunately results are less good when the disease is advanced in 1992, this cancer killed 123 men in england and wales few men examine themselves regularly only 3 per cent according to an imperial cancer research fund icrf study as for breast disease the value of self-examination is disputed but many authorities now recommend it on the basis that it is important to be familiar with one's own anatomy signs to be taken seriously include swelling of one testicle or a lump on the front or side sometimes there is real pain but often there are only vague symptoms such as dull ache heaviness or change in feel unfortunately men are reluctant to go to the doctor and may have to be propelled into the surgery by wife or girlfriend many men perhaps believing that the symptoms will go away leave things too late over half of all those with testicular cancer seek help after the tumour has spread this cancer does not spread to the easily felt lymph glands in the groin but to those around the aorta deep within the abdomen this is entirely logical given that the testicle originates embryologically from that area in the past 20 years the incidence of testicular cancer has doubled it is rising especially in younger white men and in higher social classes for reasons which are unclear nobody knows the cause of testicular cancer but risk factors are coming to light until recently an undescended or partly descended testis was one of the few known causal factors if left surgically uncorrected beyond the age of 10 or so this condition roughly trebles the risk of testicular cancer even on the side which appears normal heredity appears to be even more important and a history of this cancer in a close relative calls for extra vigilance sons of men with the disease are four times as likely to develop it while brothers of those affected are nearly 10 times as likely to do so in the hope of finding a gene for it a research project is now being carried out into families with two or more members with testicular cancer sixty such families have been identified so far in britain and the cancer research campaign crc and icrf are on the lookout for more over the years there have been worries about the possible effect of mumps vasectomy injury and heat especially in the form of tight trousers hot baths and central heating a leading study from the uk testicular cancer study group looked into the medical and social histories of nearly 800 men with the disease in nine british health regions the findings were reported in may in the british medical journal and this month in the british journal of cancer there seems to be no association between testicular cancer and either heat or mumps even after puberty when orchitis as it is known is more likely but a history of any sexually transmitted disease appears to double the risk of this cancer there is also some relation between infertility and testicular cancer but it is not yet clear whether this is cause-and-effect men contemplating vasectomy however should be reassured there is no evidence of a link the study suggests that regular exercise could have a protective effect men who exercise for 15 or more hours a week had a substantially lower incidence but injury to the testis can double the risk this could be significant in some sports although there are not yet enough data on which to base firm advice finally there is some suggestion that an early puberty is an important risk factor this ties in with the theory that high levels of gonadotrophin hormones from the pituitary gland may stimulate cells in such a way as to promote cancerous change and since puberty is occurring earlier these days often well before the standard age of 14 in boys it is also consistent with the rising trend in testicular cancer however there is unlikely to be a single cause for this cancer or put another way one remains to be discovered for more information about testicular cancer contact icrf po box 123, lincoln's inn fields london wc2a 3 fx tel 071 242 0200 the author is a london general practitioner
