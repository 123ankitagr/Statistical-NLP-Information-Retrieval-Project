in a phone interview friday playwright christopher durang rejected charges that his play sister mary ignatius explains it all for you constitutes anti-religious bigotry as has been charged by a costa mesa couple who are protesting a local production i disagree with calling the play bigoted and i bristle at it said durang who in writing the play drew from his own experiences as a student in catholic schools what they're calling bigotry is really criticism he said does that mean that one can't criticize the church's stand on birth control sister mary was the subject of similar controversies in the early to mid-'80s durang said the uproar has died down in recent years but that he is not surprised it has resurfaced the feeneys the costa mesa couple are certainly in their right to protest and to try to change laws i just hope they don't succeed it's not appropriate to limit free speech that way durang said john and ernie feeney have complained to the costa mesa city council that a costa mesa civic playhouse production of sister mary violates newly adopted restrictions against religious or political activity by artistic groups receiving municipal grants the city has given the nonprofit playhouse 20,000 this year but durang said he does not quite believe claims that the fight is over public funding and not over censorship at heart he said the feeneys want to stop my play being spoken and that is being a censor rick vanderknyff
