although alzheimer's is the most common cause of dementia there are more than 70 others dementia may be triggered by strokes high blood pressure alcoholism medications brain tumors and infections depression and rare diseases that cause brain damage including pick's huntington's and parkinson's alzheimer's disease the disease most closely associated with aging alzheimer's causes the progressive deterioration of the brain to such an extent as to render victims unable to recognize their spouses and immediate family the patient may become confused unable to concentrate and have trouble finishing sentences more than 70 of the patients had behavioral disorders such as unprovoked aggressiveness over time alzheimer's leaves victims as helpless and just as needing as children no treatment is available to stop or reverse its degenerative effects multi-infarct dementia multi-infarct dementia or vascular dementia is caused by multiple strokes infarcts in the brain because the strokes usually occur before the symptoms of dementia appear the onset of the dementia seems sudden the strokes affect the part of the brain responsible for specific functions such as calculations and create the more generalized symptoms of disorientation and behavioral changes because of multi-infarct dementia's similarity to alzheimer's the two coexist in 15 to 20 of dementia patients no cure or reversing process exists but early assessment of cause can halt the progression of the disease parkinson's disease those with parkinson's lack dopamine in their systems this neurotransmitter helps control the tremor stiffness and slowness characteristic of the disease in late stages some patients develop dementia parkinson's patients often develop alzheimer's and at times alzheimer's patients develop parkinson's symptoms drugs can treat the motor symptoms associated with parkinson's but do not improve any mental deterioration parkinson's is considered a model for drug research on alzheimer's disease dollars and financial impact fewer research dollars go toward studying alzheimer's disease and other dementing illnesses than heart disease cancer or aids yet alzheimer's the fourth-leading cause of death among adults in the country claims more than 100,000 lives annually an estimated 4 million seniors suffer from the disease nationally while orange county has 40,000 alzheimer's victims who struggle to cope with the mysteriously debilitating brain disorder there is no known reason why the disease strikes people over the age of 60, and there is no known cure for this ultimately fatal disease further total costs which include diagnosis treatment long-term care and lost wages is estimated to be more than 88 billion each year the federal government covers 4.4 billion of these costs and state coffers are dipped into for another 4.1 billion but the remaining 79 billion is borne by alzheimer's patients and their families research dollars and the financial impact of dementias on society federal research estimated funding societal disease requests 1991 costs 1991 millions millions alzheimer's disease and related disorders 153 88,000 heart disease 704

or are often brought on by stress aami differs from alzheimer's disease and other related dementias in that aami is neither debilitating nor progressive commonly thought of as forgetfulness aami can be brought on by grief depression illness stress medication alcohol fatigue lack of concentration or just attempting to remember too many details at once alzheimer activity patient aami forgets whole experience parts of an experience remembers later rarely often follow written or gradually unable usually able spoken directions able to use notes reminders gradually unable usually able able to care for self gradually unable usually able alzheimer's disease alzheimer's disease often mistakenly thought to be the definition of dementia is the most commonly known of the 60 possible causes of senile dementia declines in intellectual functions and in the ability to perform routine activities often renders dementia victims virtually without memory as dependent as infants on the support of others to feed clothe and bathe themselves a steady loss of brain cells intensifies the symptoms of deteriorating memory impaired judgment depression a lack of concentration and restlessness in 1989, people 75 years and older ran the greatest risk of falling victim to the debilitating and often incurable symptoms of senile dementia and within the next 50 years as the nation's senior population grows the number of dementia patients is expected to triple at what age are you most likely to fall victim to dementia age range percentage 55-64 5 65-74 16 75-84 42 85 and older 37 source source national institute on aging what is dementia dementia is a term applied to a group of progressively debilitating symptoms including the inability to learn or remember information repetitive behavior inarticulateness and personality and behavioral changes even at advanced ages memory loss that interferes with everyday life is not normal any person exhibiting an increased inability to think or reason should contact one of the local assessment centers in orange county or consult a neurologist to determine the cause of the dementia progression rates of dementia vary and depending on the condition causing the brain cells to deteriorate often the symptoms can be minimized to slow progress of the disease facts about dementia you should know nearly 20 of the causes of dementia can be corrected thyroid imbalances brain tumors drug intoxication alcoholism and infections are just a few of the many treatable and reversible causes of dementia alzheimer's disease is not a generic term for forgetfulness rather alzheimer's is the most common form of the progressive degenerative and ultimately fatal diseases that produce dementia parkinson's disease multi-infarct dementia huntington's disease lou gehrig's disease and multiple sclerosis are other well-known diseases whose link to dementia are irreversible early signs of dementia include memory problems depression anxiety and an inability to concentrate long enough to read or follow the plot of television shows in orange county there are more than 40,000 victims of alzheimer's disease nationally an estimated 4 million seniors are affected by the disease by the year 2040, the total number of alzheimer's disease victims is expected to triple over 50 of all nursing home patients suffer from dementia-related disorders the annual cost of nursing facility care ranges from 24,000 to 36,000 an estimated 70 of all alzheimer's victims are cared for at home by their families annual costs of home care are approximately 18,000 congress is considering increasing the amount in federal spending allotted for alzheimer's disease research to 132 million in fiscal year 1990, an increase that would average out to a little more than 50 per patient by comparison the national institutes of health invests 10 times that amount for research on cancer heart disease and aids in the case of alzheimer's there is no cure and the cause of
