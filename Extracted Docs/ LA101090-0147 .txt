is available to stop or reverse its degenerative effects multiinfarct dementia multiinfarct dementia or vascular dementia is caused by multiple strokes infarcts in the brain because the strokes usually occur before the symptoms of dementia appear the onset of the dementia seems sudden the strokes affect the part of the brain responsible for specific functions such as calculations and create the more generalized symptoms of disorientation and behavioral changes because of multiinfarct dementias similarity to alzheimers the two coexist in 15 to 20 of dementia patients no cure or reversing process exists but early assessment of cause can halt the progression of the disease parkinsons disease those with parkinsons lack dopamine in their systems this neurotransmitter helps control the tremor stiffness and slowness characteristic of the disease in late stages some patients develop dementia parkinsons patients often develop alzheimers and at times alzheimers patients develop parkinsons symptoms drugs can treat the motor symptoms associated with parkinsons but do not improve any mental deterioration parkinsons is considered a model for drug research on alzheimers disease
