he swallowed his words saying we have done some things wrong in this administration and the top man always takes the responsibility he fought back tears talking about his father who owned the poorest lemon ranch in california then sold it before they struck oil and became a grocer but he was a great man because he did his job and when he mentioned his mother whom he said no one would ever write a book about his voice fell to a whisper well i guess all of you would say this about your mother he paused my mother was a saint remember it was from richard nixons last speech as president on friday aug 9 1974 coming back to tv in the form of docudrama and these were the final days in the shooting of the final days a threehour movie for abc based on the 1976 book by bob woodward and carl bernstein with actor lane smith as nixon as the fourth in a series of att presents dramas final days airs next season in the gold room at pasadena civic auditorium late last winter the highceilinged ballroom bore the closest resemblance the producers could find to the east room of the white house there was a palpable hush among the cast and 200 extras as smith portrayed nixon behind the nixon character a pace and off to his left stood actress susan brown looking ohsomuch like the real pat nixon with her prim hairdo and pinkandwhite gingham dress just like the one the first lady wore that final day as mrs nixon the actress also wore a stoic face reddened by the effort to stay in control the characters of the two nixon daughters and sonsinlaw completed the picture now 15 years later and much to the disapproval of nixon family loyalists here they all are again dick and pat watergate and the lawyers the courts and the tapes facing certain impeachment on charges of obstruction of justice and abuse of power the 37th president had virtually no choice but to resign the irony was that it was not the actual breakin at democratic national committee headquarters at the watergate complex in 1972 that forced the first presidential resignation in american history but the coverup afterward as the last chapter of the watergate scandal written by the two washington post reporters who broke the watergate story final days was the stuff of high drama like the book the script deals with the behindthescenes saga of the last 15 months in the nixon white house the mood of fatalism is summed up early on in the docudrama when nixon lawyer leonard garment played by st elsewheres ed flanders says weve got time bombs all over some have already exploded the rest lie ticking i didnt want to do the obvious said executive producer stu samuels who had been abcs vice president for movies and miniseries when the day after the landmark drama about nuclear war and something about amelia the first tv movie to deal with incest were made i didnt want to bash nixon without prompting samuels shrugged because its too easy the issue for me was how do you provide insight into the mistake clearly nixon had made a mistake how did that happen look at the mans accomplishments nixon remains one of the most outstanding presidents in contemporary history with regard to his achievements he did get us out of vietnam he did reopen a dialogue with china this is not a stupid man a man given to casual error theres a wonderful moment in the movie samuels said when nixon is in his eob executive office building office when he says to press secretary ron ziegler maybe we were talking about a coverup its as though he were waking from a dream at least from an unconscious state and asking himself is this what we were doing our own assessment is that this president acted as though he were on a kind of auto pilot the script was written by hugh whitemore an englishman who wrote concealed enemies pbs emmywinning american playhouse miniseries about the alger hiss case in which thenrep nixon had a featured role as well as the plays pack of lies and breaking the code both samuels and abc felt that a nonamerican would be more dispassionate whitemore anchored his script around nixon lawyer j fred buzhardt its pure instinct but dramatically it seems to me things work better with much lessknown people the writer said so while the relatively unfamiliar smith and brown respectively play nixon and mrs nixon richard kiley a year in the life man of la mancha is buzhardt asked what attracted him to the role of buzhardt one the least known of the watergate players kiley snapped to attention you just answered your own question he was one of the mystery men very much behind the scenes and yet he played a key role he was the one who really found the incriminating tape passages woodward now an assistant managing editor at the washington post and author of another controversial bookturnedmovie wired about the final days of comedian john belushi was an active consultant on the production he supplied notes on buzhardt it was in the final speech that nixon shed some emotional masks as well as a certain vanity reading a passage from theodore roosevelts diary he put his glasses on for the first time in public so does smith in his long monologue how do you play nixon and how do you bypass what director richard pearce calls the bump that instant when the audience knows its an actor after all pearce country heartland who was in yales class of 1965 with woodward though they didnt know each other then said he did not want the portrait of nixon to be charged with a star turn somebody who is doing nixon so with abcs consent he chose smith 50 originally from memphis a professional actor for 29 years who won a drama desk award for his role in glengarry glen ross on broadway the actor was cast so hurriedly as nixon less than a week before shooting began that he had no time to read the book his hairline was shaved to resemble nixons and each morning his hair had to be fingerwaved but a prosthetic skijump nose was not used neither pearce nor smith wanted imitation or caricature preparing to read for abc smith found an old nixon tape i got the physicality of nixon smith said hes so specific in what he does but you have to get it to the point where its second nature to you and then not overdo it i stay pretty much in character the whole time im here i stay in the physicality ill show you smith said standing and hitching up his trousers my father used to wear his pants real high like they did in those days and all of a sudden i saw pictures of nixon with his pants way up to here so you put your pants up there and its a little tilt back and then all of a sudden its just there smith captured the nixon wave as he stood on the helicopter ramp when he realized nixon throws his hand away almost his wrist its limp but its not effeminate and i think part of that physicality is that theres so much emotion there the actor deliberately did not view tapes of nixons final speech but he said he could play it because he understands loss here you have this man totally isolated from everybody from his loved ones he cant reach out to a soul with all the power and majesty of his office you have him isolated down to three or four people so you see the pain wasnt the pain brought on by nixon himself smith was asked pain is pain i cant approach this right or wrong whos going to throw the first stone here regardless of whether he brought this upon himself its tragedy greek tragedy its richard iii the fatal flaw and i had to evoke in my experience that pain i called on the very most private things that have occurred to me as far as the loss of a great love and the isolation when things totally turned against me in my life he was quiet for a moment making it clear he would not brook further questions then added if there is a parallel between nixon and lane smith its that ive been waiting for this moment for many many years and for this kind of work so when it came about even with this short a period of time its like everything that i know my whole experience of 36 years 29 professional it all came together for pearce 15 years after nixons resignation his movie must balance the emotional issues surrounding this mans loss of the presidency and the abuses of power that went on during the nixon presidency its not the sorrow and the pity its like the horror and the pity two days after principal photography was done in march the director was discussing technique as well as politics we begin the movie its not in the script when nixon is backstage on nomination night 68 and it echoes everything up to the robert f kennedy assassination all the secret service are there and the kitchen help and the campaigners and you nixon are like a rock star for me theres a great shot from an early film when people were first working with handheld cameras its a documentary called primary about john f kennedy in the wisconsin primary this was early cinema verite where people were following a character around the camera was right behind the back of his head and you saw what it was like to be kennedy that night pearce would have liked to take the nixon character onto the stage to see the whole place rise up but he said budgetary constraints precluded recreating the gop convention in miami but we could take him right up to the moment that he walks out on stage pearce continued and then with stock footage you see nixon from a distance the footage so far away you can accept it then we go to the speech that begins the script and the preparations for it you dont see lane smiths face you see it the way you saw kennedy you never saw jack kennedys face you saw everybody else relating to him you never hear nixons actual voice you hear lanes voice then what happens you gradually introduce the image of him as nixon on a tv monitor it was easier to introduce him where you sort of felt he was president hes talking about accepting the resignations of hr haldeman and john ehrlichman hes speaking about watergate by the end of that speech said pearce we will have seen enough of lane as president to allow him to speak directly to the audience the nixon camp apparently first learned about a tv production of the final days after pearce phoned steve bull now a tobacco company lobbyist who had been nixons personal aide you can imagine im going to have to recreate not just the words but what it felt like to be in the room did nixon pace did he just sit at his desk did somebody smoke hundreds of questions so pearce invited bull to the set suddenly he was talking as if this was an ideological issue the book was the enemy woodward and bernstein were the enemy samuels says with pride that the script scrupulously adheres to the book the primary source we are dealing with a living expresident and in all of us there was a sense of responsibility for getting it right you dont want to take cheap shots it wasnt a question of libel on the other hand here is a book written by two of americas most noted journalists in existence for years now and with no legal action against it old arguments involving the accuracy of specific incidents in the final days see story on page 80 also did not bother alfred r schneider abc vice president for policy and standards we relied on the veracity of the book he said adding its certainly of notice that a lawsuit did not occur still the script does contain certain inaccuracies such as having nixon in the white house as the supreme court unanimously ruled he had to turn over crucial tapes when actually he was in san clemente i kept driving whitemore back to whats in the book noted woodward and for reasons of compression he may have had to do it a different way in all the presidents men they had to compress the city editor and metropolitan editor into one character as a reporter i would do it the way it happened but he quickly added that he and bernstein had the luxury of a 450page book more important woodward noted whitemore caught the emotional reality inside the white house the isolation of nixon as i watched some of it being made theres not a wasted word or phrase its very tight very directed at the target what was it like jack kennedys question to journalists always had been tell me what it was like at samuels request woodward phoned schneider to clear up two problems the abc executive had with the script one was the kissingernixon prayer scene woodward said and essentially there are differences in the kissinger and final days versions and i said now sit down and read em both whats really different here and whats disputed theres really minor difference in final days woodward and bernstein wrote that kissinger knelt along with nixon that wednesday night before nixon resigned nixon seemed to back them up woodward points out in his memoirs nixon said he asked kissinger to pray with me now and we knelt kissinger wrote in whatever posture i was filled with a deep sense of awe woodward also stands by their books account of nixon pounding the carpet even kissinger described nixon as shattered woodward said on a second point woodward said he and schneider discussed a scene in the script which is in the book where nixon is portrayed gnawing at an aspirin bottle because he cant open it with his hands they had to make sure it was an illustration of clumsiness and not that he was going to kill himself woodward said and that it was aspirin woodward said he told schneider he could justify everything he and bernstein wrote in court if it ever came to that but we wouldnt reveal our sources but its not the issue now woodward explained the essential historical point is that with time truth emerges ill tell you one thing that hugh whitemore used woodward said when julie nixon eisenhower said in her book the family was talking about the tape transcripts and nixon says was it worth it wow i wished wed had that line from woodcliff lake nj where nixon has his office not far from his home in saddle river aide john taylor said the expresident has lived through hammer blow after hammer blow of pressure and controversy frankly an abc entertainment dramatization of the final days at this late point is really not going to keep richard nixon up nights associated press
