bread-wheat crops around the world have been hit by bad weather for the second year running milling industry sources report harvests that have been delayed or spoiled by cold wet conditions are arriving on the market with quality well below normal tight supplies in europe are driving up prices of high protein bread-grain ironically in a year when price cuts were expected to result from the reform of the european community's common agricultural policy when milling wheat crops ran into trouble last year exporting countries were lucky to have large stocks of high quality grain to eke out from previous good harvests in 1991 prices rose to levels unseen for some years as stores were stripped almost bare but few customers went short however as uk milling giant rhm summed up last july we can't afford any more crop problems in 1993 it is not only the northern hemisphere suppliers that are short of good quality bread-wheat australia had a rain-damaged crop last season and is still some weeks away from its next harvest although australian quality looks much better this year prices for its prime hard high protein wheats are already dollars 50 a tonne more than they were last summer following the world trend high protein wheat is essential for millers producing the typical anglo saxon loaf firm and aerated ideal for wrapping and slicing the protein gives strength and elasticity to the bubbles that form as wheat dough is baked enabling the bread to rise and hold shape despite the enormous advance in uk self-sufficiency in bread-wheat since it joined the ec in the early 1970 s it usually grows between 2.5 m and 3 m tonnes of its own soft or lower protein bread-wheats some hard high protein imported wheat is vital to get the right dough mix some continental millers are better off than their uk counterparts the typical french loaf can get by on much less protein but the quality shortages and the scramble for supplies is affecting prices for all normally uk millers count on canada to fill a protein gap of about 250,000 tonnes but canada's crops have been hit by early snowfalls and delayed by weeks of wet and wintry weather average protein content of its top wheat grades has dropped from a normal 14.5 per cent to just above i3 per cent according to the canadian wheat board even for canada's lower protein wheats prices are sharply higher currently nudging pounds 250 a tonne delivered to uk mills one leading uk miller estimated that canadian 13.5 per cent protein wheat the least he could get by on would probably cost him pounds 300 a tonne delivered basically for every tonne of pounds 140-a-tonne uk bread-wheat we don't get we will have to put in some pounds 300 canadian wheat if we can get it he explained ruefully uk ministry of agriculture figures show that the proportion of uk wheat in the millers grist has already fallen to only 56 per cent from 83 per cent this time last year leading uk grain merchants dalgety recently estimated uk wheat proteins were also down by about 1 per cent this season raising costs and requiring the use of other inputs the us is an occasional hard-wheat supplier to europe but is unlikely to fill the canadian shortfall following rain and disease damage to much of its spring planted bread-wheat which has recently traded at 13-year highs millers will therefore have to scour continental europe for high protein wheat where they will find a very mixed picture despite a reported 4 m tonnes of milling wheat downgraded by bad weather to animal feed french farmers are reported to have plenty of quality grain but high proteins are not one of their strong points one shipper pointed out germany also has a mixed bag of good-to-rain spoiled milling wheats but merchants there are now demanding higher prices reportedly leaving many of their own millers short denmark and spain other frequent sources of bread-wheats have also been unable to provide the right high quality grain so far another traditional option for millers short of high protein wheat is to incorporate large quantities of wheat gluten a by-product of starch manufacture to solve the bubble problem in loaves made from lower protein wheats but more bad news thanks to europe's recession and a glut of cheap competing potato starch wheat starch production has collapsed and wheat gluten supplies along with it american millers have meanwhile been snapping up dwindling european gluten supplies to offset their own protein wheat shortfalls us starch made from maize and its by-product corn gluten is only fit for animal feed anyone who bought ec wheat gluten in june at pounds 700 a tonne should be celebrating its price has since rocketed to pounds l 590 crunch time comes early in 1994 many of the big uk milling concerns will then run out of the canadian 1991 crop stocks they prudently bought forward before this summer's wash-out after that we're on to what comes out of the 1993 crops and it doesn't look good one summed up weather and other factors have also made a mockery of much vaunted cost benefits grain consumers expected from reforms of the general agreement on tariffs and trade headline wheat price cuts of pounds 59 per tonne have simply not materialised due to the premiums quoted on bread-wheats over ordinary wheat one industry executive lamented on top of that many countries domestic and imported prices have been strengthened by weak currencies surrounding the erm's ec exchange rate mechanism's collapse even farmers may be robbed of profit from the rise in milling wheat values because their bread-wheat crops failed to perform as expected and there is an ominous flip-side to this situation a flood of cheap feed-wheat sloshing around the european and world markets pushing the export price down to just dollars 60 a tonne its lowest for some years meanwhile the rise in bread-wheat prices shows no sign yet of levelling off
