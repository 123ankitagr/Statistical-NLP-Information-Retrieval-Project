Five of the Mercury 7 astronauts , America 's first and perhaps most beloved space explorers , returned to their history-making roots Friday to help dedicate the Astronaut Hall of Fame . `` We do n't sit around getting nostalgic , '' said Donald ( Deke ) Slayton , now 66 . `` We 're trying to make things happen for the future . '' The United States Astronaut Hall of Fame , 13 miles from where the men rocketed into history three decades ago , is a tribute to their exploits . There is an `` umbilical '' plug from the Freedom 7 spacecraft that carried Alan Shepard on a 15-minute suborbital flight in 1961 , making him the first American in space . There is a chunk of the Atlas rocket that propelled John Glenn into space in 1962 , America 's first manned orbital mission . There is Walter Schirra 's Mercury spacecraft , the late Virgil ( Gus ) Grissom 's spacesuit , L. Gordon Cooper 's spacecraft heat shield , Malcolm Scott Carpenter 's camera with which he photographed Earth , and Slayton 's food tubes from the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz mission .
