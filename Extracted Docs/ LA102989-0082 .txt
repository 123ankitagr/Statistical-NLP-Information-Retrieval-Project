The Rev . Louis P. Sheldon 's response ( Oct. 15 ) to the editorial entitled `` The Freedom to Decide '' was , to say the least , quite interesting . The crux of his argument is that homosexuality is not prescribed in the genetic code . My question for the reverend is : Since when is bigotry contained in the genetic code ? Sheldon states that the act of sodomy is the underlying connection of homosexuals . And I ask : Is prejudice not the common link of bigots ? And most unfortunately , I know of no reparative therapy or medical treatment for those who desire change . KENT NEAL Laguna Beach
