UPON LEAVING my previous employer , I transferred my pension into a lump sum bond with a life assurance office . This is invested in unit trusts and will provide a lump sum plus a pension for me at age-50 . The sum held in units is Pounds 60,000 . Can this kind of fund be auctioned ? If so , how would I go about it ? I am now 44 and recently lost my job . I would like to use any money realised at auction to go into business . Retirement annuity policies , unlike ordinary life policies , are not assignable ( an Inland Revenue requirement ) and benefits can be taken only in the approved form by the person who has enjoyed the expense relief on his or her contributions . If you wish to raise some capital to start a business , you should ask the insurance company whether it is prepared to make you a loan . Over the years , a number of insurance companies have been prepared to offer loan facilities to their pension policy-holders up to the amount that they reasonably expect to be repaid out of the tax-free lump sum which can be taken at retirement ( and which , therefore , provides a guarantee that the loan will be repaid ) . No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns . All enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible .
