Here is an opportunity to take a break from the crowded shopping malls and their parking lots to step back in time -- to a Christmas setting of 100 or more years ago . Rancho Los Cerritos Historic Site in Long Beach will hold its annual Christmas open house from 1 to 4 p.m. today . It can be an afternoon of wonderment for adults and old-fashioned fun for children . Visitors can wander through the house whose every room is adorned with 19th-Century furnishings and Christmas decorations . A costumed volunteer docent will be inside each room to tell portions of the rancho 's history , from its humble beginnings as a Mexican cattle ranch to its development by 1880 into one of the largest sheep ranches in Southern California . Guests also will learn about the Bixby family , owners of the rancho , and how they and their ranch workers celebrated Christmas , according to Ellen Calomiris , historic sites officer for the city of Long Beach . Outside , visitors can stroll through the gardens , snacking on cookies and hot apple cider . The Silver Strings music group will entertain with songs of the season . A pinata event for children is scheduled at 2:30 p.m . This old Mexican tradition was a favorite in California during the Christmas season in the 1800s -- and still is today . Santa Claus also will be there to distribute treats . Rancho Los Cerritos Historic Site is at 4600 Virginia Road , on the grounds of the Virginia Country Club in the Bixby Knolls area of northwest Long Beach . Access is off San Antonio Drive . The Christmas open house is free to everyone , and no reservations are necessary . DON ERICKSON
