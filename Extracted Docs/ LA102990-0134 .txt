'' I HATED to let you kiss me , I only did it because you begged me , you hounded me ! And after you did , I used to wipe my mouth -- wipe my mouth ! '' -- Bette Davis as the slatternly waitress Mildred , cutting Leslie Howard to the quick in the 1934 movie of Somerset Maugham 's `` Of Human Bondage . '' All right , perhaps Bette 's Mildred was n't the nicest hash-slinger you 'd ever want to meet , but her performance was the turning point of her career . And it seems that one of the best ways for an actress to attract attention is to portray a waitress ! Just ask Susan Sarandon , who has garnered rave reviews for her steamy stint in the current sizzler `` White Palace . '' Sarandon , who has been on the delicious edge of all-out movie stardom for several years , seems a virtual shoo-in for an Oscar nomination . She follows such famous cinematic hamburger hefters as Joan Crawford in `` Mildred Pierce , '' Ellen Burstyn in `` Alice Does n't Live Here Anymore , '' Cher in `` Come Back to the Five and Dime , Jimmy Dean , Jimmy Dean '' and Karen Black in `` Five Easy Pieces . '' Even Elizabeth Taylor played a waitress once ! ( Maybe `` Hammersmith Is Out '' was n't one of the great movies of our time -- but the sight of ET dishing out chow , in a blond wig and miniskirt was memorable . ) BACK TO `` White Palace '' for a minute . Many are hoping that Sarandon 's young co-star , James Spader , will nab a nomination for his performance in this movie as the up-tight yuppie who ca n't resist the way Susan slaps that burger on those buns . He was overlooked for `` sex , lies , and videotape '' last year .
