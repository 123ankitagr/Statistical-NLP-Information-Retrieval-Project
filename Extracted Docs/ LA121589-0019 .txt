The San Diego area will experience a brief lull in Santa Ana winds today , only to have a stronger , colder set of Santa Anas arrive Sunday night and Monday morning , according to the National Weather Service . `` The Santa Anas are falling apart , becoming very , very weak , and a sea breeze is starting to come in , temporarily , through Saturday , '' forecaster Wilbur Shigehara said . `` Because of the lull in the Santa Anas , humidity will be up a little , but still low . As Sunday and Monday Santa Anas come , humidity will once again plunge . '' The Santa Anas will be particularly chilly because of an influx of cold air from Canada , cold enough for the Weather Service to issue a frost advisory for Sunday night in the agricultural valleys . The cooling trend will last until Tuesday . Temperatures for the inland valleys will reach lows of 27 degrees and highs of 65 to 70 degrees Sunday . Mountain areas will be cool this weekend , with highs hitting 52 to 57 degrees Friday and lows of 23 to 33 degrees all weekend . Desert regions can expect highs of 70 degrees Friday , falling a bit Saturday and Sunday , and temperatures as low as 30 degrees at night . Winds in the desert will reach 30 m.p.h . before the cold Santa Ana winds kick in Sunday night . Beach temperatures will reach 66 over the weekend , with inland coastal regions slightly higher . High tides for the weekend will be under 7 feet , Shigehara said , but should cause no problems . `` Winter is around the corner , '' said Shigehara . Winter officially begins at 1:22 p.m. next Thursday . It may , however , arrive a bit earlier . `` Monday should be a harbinger of winter , with temperatures in the mid-60s along the coast and upper 60s inland , and chilly winds , '' Shigehara said . It appears that this winter will be nothing unusual , he added , with temperatures and rainfall forecast to be about the same as last year .
