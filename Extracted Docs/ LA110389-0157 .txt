The Orange County Hazardous Materials Team , administered by the county Health Care Agency division of environmental health , responds to calls on chemical spills and other incidents involving hazardous materials . Sometimes it goes to the site , other times it advises citizens or local fire departments over the phone . Of 17 local fire departments in Orange County ( 16 city departments plus the county ) , three have hazardous materials units that cover the county through mutual aid agreements -- Anaheim , Huntington Beach and the county station in Irvine .
