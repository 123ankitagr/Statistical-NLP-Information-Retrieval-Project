United Nations officials reported a new wave of 'ethnic cleansing ' yesterday in an apparent rush by Croats and Moslems to consolidate their holds on disputed areas of central Bosnia as peace talks got under way in Geneva , Reuter reports from Sarajevo and Zenica . Although the front lines were mainly quiet , Bosnian Croat forces were pushing Moslems out of villages they held around Vares , 30 miles north of Sarajevo , and from the town of Kiseljak , just west of the besieged Bosnia capital . Moslem forces were simultaneously clearing Croats from recently captured territory further west at Novi Travnik . The town of Zenica suffered renewed shelling which killed nine people . This was the second worst incident the town has suffered since the beginning of the war over a year ago . Residents of the housing estate where the shells fell said three shells were fired from the Croat-held town of Vitez , seven miles to the south .
