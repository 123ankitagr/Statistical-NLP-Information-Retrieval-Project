Prompted by appeals from a 14-year-old boy , the City Council gave preliminary approval Tuesday to an ordinance that restricts stores from openly displaying sexually explicit books , magazines and videos . Randy Wiser , an eighth-grader at Foothill Christian School in Glendora , said he approached city officials in February because he was concerned that pornographic magazines were being sold to minors . If given final approval Sept. 11 , the ordinance will require racks that partially hide erotic material from view . City Atty . Ken Brown said pornographic videos will have to be in an area restricted with an `` adults only '' sign . California law prohibits sale of erotic material to those under 18 .
