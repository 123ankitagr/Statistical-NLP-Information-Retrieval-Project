MR Julian Mounter , chief executive of Star TV , the Asian satellite venture , is expected to announce his resignation tomorrow . The move comes a week after Mr Rupert Murdoch 's News Corporation bought a majority stake in the company , which broadcasts five channels of television to 38 countries . The cash and shares deal was worth around Dollars 525m . His resignation will come as a surprise after appearing last week to be looking forward to working with the new owners of Star TV . A meeting with Mr Murdoch was expected in Los Angeles this week . News Corporation said it would be interested in maintaining some relationship with Mr Mounter , whose experience ranges from working for The Times newspaper and Thames Television in the UK . He was also director-general of the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation . He then took a year off to sail the world before becoming chief executive of Star last September . He was involved in the negotiations which pitted Pearson , owners of the Financial Times , against News Corp for a majority stake in Star .
