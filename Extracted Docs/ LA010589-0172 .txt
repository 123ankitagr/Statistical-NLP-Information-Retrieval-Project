Citing philosophical differences , the City Council fired City Manager Murray L. Warden at the Council 's regular meeting Tuesday night . `` This was essentially a parting of the ways , '' said Mayor Charles V. ( Chuck ) Smith , who added that Warden , who was hired 8 months ago , and the council `` never clicked . '' The termination was effective immediately . The decision was announced after Warden met with council members in a closed session to discuss his job performance , Smith said . Warden accepted the position of city administrator , but the job later was modified , with the City Council 's approval , and he was given the city manager 's title . `` Murray had his way of doing things , and they did n't always coincide with the council 's way , '' Smith said . `` We did n't really clash , but we did n't really have a meeting of the minds as to how things were going to get done . '' Jerry Kenny , public works director , was to become interim city manager immediately . Kenny , who has been employed with the city 15 years , is a former community development director and former director of finance . Warden could not be reached for comment Wednesday .
