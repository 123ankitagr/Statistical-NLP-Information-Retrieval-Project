Sir , I am writing to correct the implication that New Zealand lamb is a cheap alternative to British in David Richardson 's article ( Farmer's Viewpoint , February 18 ) . New Zealand lamb has a place in the European market in providing a complementary supply and sustaining interest in lamb at a time when the domestic product is either not available or of variable quality . British producers rushing to get the most out of the variable premium , prior to its abolition at the end of last year , created some of the problem by having lower than normal stocks available to supply their customers in the new year . Traditionally , at this time of year , the British product is variable and supermarkets , as always , supply their consumers with the best quality product available . They have chosen the New Zealand product . Their decision is not solely based on price but on value for money . New Zealand 's unsubsidised producers are constantly having to compete with situations such as this which have been created by market distorting policies . To borrow a phrase from Mr Richardson 's headline : New Zealand farmers are 'not in the mood for joking ' either ] Neil Taylor , trade policy director ( Europe ) , New Zealand Meat Producers Board , Totara Park House , 34/36 Grays Inn Road , London WC1X 8HR
