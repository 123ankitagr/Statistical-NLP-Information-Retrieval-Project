Producers at Australia 's largest gold mine , hurting from low gold prices , cut jobs and closed down some high-cost underground operations today . `` It 's a reflection of the difficult times we 're in , '' said gold stock analyst Howard Walker at broker J B Were . `` There will probably be more suspended or closed over the next few months . '' Joint venture partners Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie Ltd. and Homestake Gold of Australia Ltd. said cash costs of production at their Fimiston underground mines were running at more than $ 385 an ounce . That compares with current gold prices at around $ 353 an ounce . Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie and Homestake , an 80 % owned subsidiary of U.S. producer Homestake Mining Co. , jointly own the huge `` super pit '' and five underground mines in Western Australia 's Golden Mile area at Kalgoorlie . The price of gold is down almost $ 60 from December levels , and many analysts believe there is little chance of a recovery for the next six months .
