A federal judge on Friday upheld the government 's indictment of Exxon and rejected a plea to throw out criminal charges stemming from last year 's massive Exxon Valdez oil spill . `` I deny all motions to dismiss , '' U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland said after a two-hour hearing in which Exxon Corp. and Exxon Shipping Co. sought to have the charges against them thrown out . The ruling , to be followed by a written opinion later , was welcomed by Justice Department lawyers , who are prosecuting the two Exxon companies for the nation 's worst oil spill . `` The indictment is proper and fairly puts the defendants on notice of what they have to defend against , '' Holland said in a brief statement . Exxon lawyers at the hearing voiced disappointment over their defeat but said there would be no appeal . The trial has been set for April 10 , more than two years after the tanker Exxon Valdez rammed into Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound and spilled 11 million gallons of oil into pristine waters , fouling rich fishing grounds and wildlife habitat .
