Peugeot Citroen , the French car group , has a 'real chance ' of returning to profit this year , despite an expected slowdown in the growth in the European car market , Mr Jacques Calvet , chairman , said yesterday . Addressing a shareholders ' meeting , Mr Calvet said it was still too early to say whether the company would achieve its three financial aims for this year -a return to profit after losses of FFr1.4bn ( Dollars 250m ) in 1993 , covering investments through cash flow and a sharp reduction in group debt . The Peugeot chief said , however , that 'the first indications we have been able to get lead us to think that barring a shake-up in the car or currency markets , our chances of succeeding are real ' . According to Mr Calvet , sales rose strongly in the early part of the year . In France , he said , sales had increased by 16 per cent in the first five months , partly because of government measures to stimulate the industry . These measures included paying FFr5,000 to car owners who trade in vehicles more than 10 years old to buy a new one . The impact of these measures has , however , begun to wear off . Mr Calvet described the recovery in the European and French car markets as fragile , and partly artificial . Mr Calvet said that hard times still lay ahead , resulting from overcapacity in the market , and uncertain demand . As a result , Peugeot Citroen will continue to cut costs . This year , the company would again aim for a 12 per cent improvement in productivity , Mr Calvet said .
