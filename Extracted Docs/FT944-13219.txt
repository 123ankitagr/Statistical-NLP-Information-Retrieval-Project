fears that this year's strong demand growth for commodity chemicals was merely restocking were confounded yesterday by ici's third-quarter results the figures were unusually strong even for this stage of the cycle heady demand in asia and the us has led to a change in trade flows reducing imports into europe and increasing exports with rising world demand and limited new supply prices should rise sharply spot commodity chemical prices have already increased though ici is yet to benefit fully because contract price rises have only just started coming through these will be driven still higher when european domestic demand which has so far remained weak really recovers ici's downstream businesses such as paints may suffer from raw material cost inflation but such pressures should be more than offset by commodity chemicals the question remains whether ici is fairly valued the issue is one of timing when its earnings peak ici's shares will stand at a discount as investors anticipate the cyclical downturn but with possible earnings growth next year of 50 per cent selling now would be a mistake the chemical industry typically suffers from supply-driven not demand-led recessions so the right moment to sell will be when capital expenditure reaches unsustainable levels four years ago the group's capital expenditure was pounds 1 bn compared with depreciation of just pounds 525 m a clearly unsustainable ratio of nearly two last year ici's ratio was 0.9 suggesting there is a long way to go before over-capacity once again becomes a problem
