once again ad nauseam nixon is being rehabilitated by his nostalgic admirers and a bemused press conrad as usual is right on target in satirizing this latest resurrection of our disgraced expresident what puzzles me as a retired foreign service officer is nixons reputation as a foreign policy guru which rests largely on the puffery that surrounded his notsosurprising restoration of relations with china otherwise he has been associated with some notable fiascoes as president eisenhowers reputed expert on southeast asia our thenvice president pushed for us to replace the french when they were forced out of vietnam by the 1954 debacle of dien bien phu while he ignored any possible understanding with hanoi later his decision to bomb cambodia appears to have been part of a sequence of disasters that led to the genocidal scourge of pol pot was the slaughter of millions of cambodians part of his peace with honor on iran did nixon foresee that our overthrow of premier mohammed mossadegh in 1953 might eventually lead to the fanatical revolution of 1979 what led him as president to believe that the vain mercurial shah could be our effective surrogate in maintaining peace in that troubled area has nixon ever regretted our 1954 ouster of the leftist arbenz government of guatemala which led to a series of brutal military dictatorships and to the loss of more than 100000 lives the same deviousness and amorality that entangled nixon in watergate characterized his foreign policy maneuvers by using his national security adviser henry kissinger as de facto secretary of state he was able to avoid congress traditional scrutiny of cabinet members this finally led him to use the nsc for action purposes as in the cias apparently successful overthrow of chilean president salvador allende in 1973 which almost certainly became the precedent for the supreme folly of irangate this institutional perversion persists with president bush frequently relying on his nsc staff to perform missions that should logically fall to our resident ambassadors or to the secretary of state and his deputies marshall phillips long beach
