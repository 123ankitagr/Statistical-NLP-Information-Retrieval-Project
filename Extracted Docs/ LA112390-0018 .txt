I am extremely concerned that The Times has repeatedly run inaccurate statements about gluten that not only misinform but , more importantly , give potentially life-threatening information . For the thousands of people who have Celiac Disease ( a chronic , hereditary intestinal malabsorption disorder ) , all gluten is bad . The consequences of a Celiac eating foods with gluten ( or derivatives of ) basically boils down to death by starvation , even if they were eating a `` normal , '' well-balanced diet . The body fails to absorb fat-soluble vitamins ( A , D , and K ) and eventually stops absorbing even the simplest proteins and carbohydrates . The lack of awareness among the general public ( and unfortunately , the medical community as well ) perpetuate the many problems facing Celiacs . While Celiac Disease affects one out of every 1,500 to 2,000 Americans ( the same ratio as Muscular Sclerosis ) , patients can not get the medical information or FDA labeling laws they need to stay alive and healthy . Celiac is treatable if diagnosed in time and only when strict adherence to a gluten-free diet is maintained . -- RACHEL KAE Senior Vice President Celiac Disease Foundation
