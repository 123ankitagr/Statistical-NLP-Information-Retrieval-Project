i am extremely concerned that the times has repeatedly run inaccurate statements about gluten that not only misinform but more importantly give potentially lifethreatening information for the thousands of people who have celiac disease a chronic hereditary intestinal malabsorption disorder all gluten is bad the consequences of a celiac eating foods with gluten or derivatives of basically boils down to death by starvation even if they were eating a normal wellbalanced diet the body fails to absorb fatsoluble vitamins a d and k and eventually stops absorbing even the simplest proteins and carbohydrates the lack of awareness among the general public and unfortunately the medical community as well perpetuate the many problems facing celiacs while celiac disease affects one out of every 1500 to 2000 americans the same ratio as muscular sclerosis patients can not get the medical information or fda labeling laws they need to stay alive and healthy celiac is treatable if diagnosed in time and only when strict adherence to a glutenfree diet is maintained rachel kae senior vice president celiac disease foundation
