TOKYO Seimitsu , a leading Japanese producer of semiconductor-manufacturing systems , has agreed to buy Silicon Technology , a US chip equipment maker . Tokyo Seimitsu said it would pay Dollars 14m for Silicon Technology , which has annual sales of Dollars 5.6m . The move is part of the trend for Japanese companies to expand overseas amid the current slump in the Japanese semiconductor market . Many Japanese chip equipment makers are eager to acquire new technology from US companies . Mr Yasuo Komatsuzaki of Semiconductor Equipment and Materials International , an international trade group , said Japanese acquisitions of US equipment makers may accelerate in the near future . Tokyo Seimitsu hopes to expand its US distribution network and develop products with Silicon Technology . Silicon Technology also has a distribution network in eastern Europe and Russia , which Tokyo Seimitsu hopes to use .
