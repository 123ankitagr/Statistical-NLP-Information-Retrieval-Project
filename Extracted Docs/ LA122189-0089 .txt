In an effort to promote computer literacy and pave the way for employees to work at home , the City Council has approved an interest-free computer loan program for half- to full-time city employees . The city will provide loans of up to $ 3,000 to 43 eligible employees , including City Council members , for the purchase of home computers and software compatible with the city 's system . Assistant City Manager Don Pruyn said the program will encourage greater computer proficiency and will allow employees to work at home , reducing traffic and enabling the city to meet future South Coast Air Quality Management District requirements . The program 's $ 50,000 budget will come from the city 's Vehicle Replacement Fund , normally used to replace city trucks and other vehicles . Payments , made through monthly payroll deductions , will go back into the vehicle fund . Loans must be repaid in two years . The vendor , Computer Vision of San Dimas , in January will show city employees four computer packages available , with prices ranging from $ 1,425 to $ 3,174 .
