if president george bush makes good on his threat to veto the civil rights act of 1990 it will not only be an act of unfeeling misgovernment but also another sign of his partys failure to resolve the contradiction between what it says it intends toward minority americans and what it actually does for them when former ku klux klan leader david duke ran for the us senate as a republican bush and other gop leaders were sincerely horrified and rushed to repudiate him they have been less quick to forswear their partys historic antipathy toward civil rights legislation an antipathy that made it easier for duke to call himself a republican however uneasy it made gop regulars feel to hear him say so president bush and the other republican leaders of his generation are the architects of a strategy designed to wean southern white and northern ethnic voters away from their traditional democratic loyalties the key element in that approach is the anxiety both groups share about the legal and economic gains women africanamericans and other minorities have made as the result of the civil rights movement the gops strategy has been an electoral success but it all too frequently has turned the the party of lincoln and emancipation into the party of white male privilege through obfuscation it is of course the habit of american political discourse to excuse inequality through euphemism states rights separate but equal reverse discrimination the circumlocution bush employs to justify his hostility to the civil rights act of 1990 is quotas the president insists the bill will force quotas despite the fact it explicitly says nothing in the amendments made by this act shall be construed to require or encourage an employer to adopt hiring or promotional quotas on the basis of race color religion sex or national origin but bush recently wrote i am convinced that it will have the effect of forcing businesses to adopt quotas it will also foster divisiveness and litigation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights these observations are hard to reconcile with the bills explicit disclaimer and its actual provisions the civil rights act of 1990 aims to reverse six recent us supreme court decisions that have weakened existing federal laws against employment discrimination among other things it requires that employers once again bear the burden of legally justifying practices or policies whose objective effect is to create discriminatory patterns in hiring or promotion it also allows victims of sexual religious or ethnic discrimination to seek the same compensatory and punitive damages already available to those who have suffered racial discrimination fairminded people will search such proposals in vain for the dire consequences over which bush frets the president already has said he will allow a bill restricting advertising on childrens television to become law without his signature even though he personally feels it abridges some first amendment freedoms americans are entitled to wonder why he can not do the same for the civil rights act of 1990
