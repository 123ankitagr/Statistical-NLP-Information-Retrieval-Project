Michael Jackson says his hit songs are not his doing , that he is merely a conduit for tunes already written . Jackson made the remarks in a 1984 home video taped at his home in Encino . It was scheduled for broadcast tonight on `` A Current Affair , '' said Jeff Erdel , a spokesman for the syndicated program . In the video , the reclusive star said he feels his songs existed somewhere else before he wrote them . `` I feel I 'm just a tunnel , a tube through which they come , '' Jackson said in the video . `` I mean , 'Billie Jean ' and 'Beat It ' and all those songs have been up there somewhere and just came through to me . So even if I did it , I just ca n't always take credit . '' The video also shows Jackson playing with his pet llamas and performing scenes from `` Peter Pan . ''
