The final prosecution witnesses in the Joseph Hazelwood trial in Anchorage testified that the Exxon Valdez skipper drank enough vodka to impair judgment before the tanker sailed , and that he risked capsizing by rocking the ship back and forth after the helmsman drove it onto a reef . Alaska Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone refused to allow testimony from a state investigator assigned to guard Hazelwood after the March 24 grounding . The judge said the guard should not have questioned Hazelwood without his lawyers .
