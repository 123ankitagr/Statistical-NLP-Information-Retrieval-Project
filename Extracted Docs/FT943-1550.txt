CLS Holdings , the property investment company majority-owned by Sweden's Mortstedt family , yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.37m in the first half of 1994 , compared with a loss of Pounds 1.49m last time . Excluding exceptional items , though , the company 's first set of figures since making its stock exchange debut in May showed a profit before tax from continuing operations of Pounds 1.95m , against Pounds 575,000 before . After adjusting for transactions completed since flotation , net assets per share were 129p . The first interim dividend is 0.4p , although the Mortstedt family , who own 53 per cent of the shares , have agreed to take a scrip alternative .
