Danny Bilson and Paul De Meo love `` The Simpsons . '' `` I think 'The Simpsons ' is the best thing on TV , '' said Bilson . But Bilson and De Meo probably wo n't be seeing a lot of Bart and clan this season . The two are the executive producers of CBS ' lavish new action series , `` The Flash , '' which has the unenviable task of competing not only against the hot Fox cartoon series on Thursdays at 8 p.m. but also NBC 's ratings powerhouse , `` The Cosby Show . '' `` We have no control over ( scheduling ) , '' said Harvey Shephard , president of Warner Bros. TV , the studio behind `` The Flash . '' `` We are clearly not thrilled . '' CBS had an understandable strategy in mind when it announced the show 's scheduling last spring . Based on a DC comic book character who is the fastest man alive , `` The Flash '' was intended to challenge `` The Cosby Show '' for young viewers . `` The day after we announced , '' Bilson said , `` Fox announced 'The Simpsons ' ( would be moving from Sundays to Thursdays ) . Nobody knew they were going to do that . '' `` It was a total ambush , '' De Meo said . `` They were n't ambushing us ; they were doing the same thing we are -- ambushing 'Cosby , ' `` Bilson said . `` The last thing we want to do is to be up against 'The Simpsons . ' It 's our audience . '' To combat their predicament , CBS and Warner Bros. have been aggressively marketing `` The Flash '' in advance of its two-hour premiere Thursday at 8 p.m. '' It 's a tough time period , and every effort has to be made , '' said Doug Duitsman , vice president in charge of promotion , advertising and publicity for Warner Bros. television . A few weeks ago , Warner flew banners over beaches on both coasts . The studio also unveiled the pilot last Saturday with a big bash at its Burbank lot . CBS started its promotion in July during baseball 's All-Star game , said George Schweitzer , senior vice president of communications at the CBS Broadcast Group . `` It 's not being sold as a comic book . It 's being sold like 'Batman ' -- dark and mysterious and exciting . The promos have a theatrical quality . '' CBS also launched ad campaigns on radio and cable TV , Schweitzer said . `` We bought commercials during the wrestling matches on USA Cable and during the old 'Batman ' shows on the Family Channel . '' But the hype does n't stop there . The current Flash comic books feature ads for the series , and `` Flash '' posters are being displayed in malls and in 2,300 K-marts across the country . Four-minute promos of the series have aired at all Six Flags amusement parks . `` The Flash '' had its genesis as a TV series two years ago , when Warner Bros. , which owns DC Comics , tried to develop TV movies based on some of the characters for CBS . Bilson and De Meo conceived one that featured several superheroes , including the Flash , who had first been introduced to readers 50 years ago . None of the projects was made , but when Jeff Sagansky became CBS Entertainment president last January , he expressed interest in creating a series featuring the Flash . `` It had been so long since there had been a great superhero , '' Sagansky said . `` I was a regular reader of the Flash and all the DC comics . '' In the pilot airing Thursday , the life of a police forensic scientist ( former soap star John Wesley Shipp ) is transformed one night when his lab is struck by lightning . The resulting chemical spill causes him to become faster than a speeding bullet ; he uses his new-found power to fight criminals under the guise of the Flash . Bilson and De Meo wrote the pilot in January and began filming in May . It was finished only late last week . `` There are 125 special effects , '' Bilson said . `` It 's done on a grand scale . Even the score is done on a grand scale . '' And so is the budget . `` The Flash '' is quite literally the Six Million Dollar Man . The pilot cost $ 6 million , and it 's been reported that each one-hour episode will cost about $ 1.6 million . The superhero 's suit alone cost approximately $ 100,000 . `` The suit itself is a makeup effect , '' De Meo said . `` John had to have his entire body cast . The suit is made out of latex . It was quite a process getting it . '' `` The suit was critical , '' Bilson added . `` You ca n't , after 'Batman , ' have a guy running around in tights . '' Both agree that audiences probably have a misguided notion of what the Flash is really all about . `` We are fighting against preconceptions of other superhero shows that have been on TV in the past , '' De Meo said . `` The simplest analogy is that it 's close to 'Batman ' the movie , not 'Batman ' the ( TV ) show . We never get silly . '' CBS is giving `` The Flash '' ample chance to succeed . `` It 's a very tough time period , '' Sagansky said . If viewers miss the premiere on Thursday , they can catch a repeat Sept. 28 at 11:30 p.m. And , as a test , the second episode will air next Thursday at 8:30 p.m. , opposite less formidable competition : Fox 's new series `` Babes , '' NBC 's `` A Different World '' and the second half hour of ABC 's `` The Father Dowling Mysteries . '' `` They ( CBS ) are not going to waste this show , '' Bilson said . `` Look at what else they have on . Not only does this cost a lot of money , it has the potential of being the first action-adventure show to work at 8 p.m. since 'The A-Team . ' The bottom line around here is that when 'The Simpsons ' was announced , everybody said , 'Just make a good show . If it 's a good show , it will stay on the air . ' ``
