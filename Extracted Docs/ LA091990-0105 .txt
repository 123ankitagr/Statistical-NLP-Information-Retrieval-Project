danny bilson and paul de meo love the simpsons i think the simpsons is the best thing on tv said bilson but bilson and de meo probably wont be seeing a lot of bart and clan this season the two are the executive producers of cbs lavish new action series the flash which has the unenviable task of competing not only against the hot fox cartoon series on thursdays at 8 pm but also nbcs ratings powerhouse the cosby show we have no control over scheduling said harvey shephard president of warner bros tv the studio behind the flash we are clearly not thrilled cbs had an understandable strategy in mind when it announced the shows scheduling last spring based on a dc comic book character who is the fastest man alive the flash was intended to challenge the cosby show for young viewers the day after we announced bilson said fox announced the simpsons would be moving from sundays to thursdays nobody knew they were going to do that it was a total ambush de meo said they werent ambushing us they were doing the same thing we are ambushing cosby bilson said the last thing we want to do is to be up against the simpsons its our audience to combat their predicament cbs and warner bros have been aggressively marketing the flash in advance of its twohour premiere thursday at 8 pm its a tough time period and every effort has to be made said doug duitsman vice president in charge of promotion advertising and publicity for warner bros television a few weeks ago warner flew banners over beaches on both coasts the studio also unveiled the pilot last saturday with a big bash at its burbank lot cbs started its promotion in july during baseballs allstar game said george schweitzer senior vice president of communications at the cbs broadcast group its not being sold as a comic book its being sold like batman dark and mysterious and exciting the promos have a theatrical quality cbs also launched ad campaigns on radio and cable tv schweitzer said we bought commercials during the wrestling matches on usa cable and during the old batman shows on the family channel but the hype doesnt stop there the current flash comic books feature ads for the series and flash posters are being displayed in malls and in 2300 kmarts across the country fourminute promos of the series have aired at all six flags amusement parks the flash had its genesis as a tv series two years ago when warner bros which owns dc comics tried to develop tv movies based on some of the characters for cbs bilson and de meo conceived one that featured several superheroes including the flash who had first been introduced to readers 50 years ago none of the projects was made but when jeff sagansky became cbs entertainment president last january he expressed interest in creating a series featuring the flash it had been so long since there had been a great superhero sagansky said i was a regular reader of the flash and all the dc comics in the pilot airing thursday the life of a police forensic scientist former soap star john wesley shipp is transformed one night when his lab is struck by lightning the resulting chemical spill causes him to become faster than a speeding bullet he uses his newfound power to fight criminals under the guise of the flash bilson and de meo wrote the pilot in january and began filming in may it was finished only late last week there are 125 special effects bilson said its done on a grand scale even the score is done on a grand scale and so is the budget the flash is quite literally the six million dollar man the pilot cost $ 6 million and its been reported that each onehour episode will cost about $ 16 million the superheros suit alone cost approximately $ 100000 the suit itself is a makeup effect de meo said john had to have his entire body cast the suit is made out of latex it was quite a process getting it the suit was critical bilson added you cant after batman have a guy running around in tights both agree that audiences probably have a misguided notion of what the flash is really all about we are fighting against preconceptions of other superhero shows that have been on tv in the past de meo said the simplest analogy is that its close to batman the movie not batman the tv show we never get silly cbs is giving the flash ample chance to succeed its a very tough time period sagansky said if viewers miss the premiere on thursday they can catch a repeat sept 28 at 1130 pm and as a test the second episode will air next thursday at 830 pm opposite less formidable competition foxs new series babes nbcs a different world and the second half hour of abcs the father dowling mysteries they cbs are not going to waste this show bilson said look at what else they have on not only does this cost a lot of money it has the potential of being the first actionadventure show to work at 8 pm since the ateam the bottom line around here is that when the simpsons was announced everybody said just make a good show if its a good show it will stay on the air
