an american research team has won the race for the most sought-after prize in science this year isolating the gene that causes an inherited form of breast cancer dr mark scolnick and colleagues at the university of utah have found the gene called brca1 responsible for an estimated 3 to 5 per cent of breast cancers ahead of a dozen other research groups in the us and europe the discovery was announced last night by the us research journal science which will publish details next month at the same time science said an international team led by dr douglas eaton of the institute of cancer research in the uk was well down the road to isolating a second gene brca2 which probably causes another 3 to 5 per cent of breast cancers finding the two genes will enable scientists to develop tests that women with a family history of breast cancer can take to discover whether they are individually at risk of developing an inherited form of the disease prototype tests for brca1 may be available within two years women who know they carry the genes will be able better to monitor themselves for early signs of cancer or even have a mastectomy as a precaution those whose tests are negative in spite of a family history will be reassured but scientists say the discoveries will eventually also help the 90 per cent of breast cancer patients whose disease is not inherited random mutations in the same genes are probably involved there too and understanding the chemical processes by which brca1 and brca2 trigger cancer will help researchers develop drugs to treat the disease these are very exciting stepping stones on the path to more effective treatment and diagnosis of breast cancer said dr bruce ponder a uk cancer research campaign scientist working at cambridge university on cancer genes but it's important for people to realise that there are no immediate practical consequences the search for breast cancer genes described last year by dr james watson a founder of modern genetics as the most exciting story in medical science has caught the scientific and popular imagination the national cancer institute and the us army have responded to health lobbyists by devoting many millions of dollars to the quest
