EAST JAPAN RAILWAY , one of the seven divisions of Japan Railway Group , the former Japanese National Railway , which was incorporated in 1987 , has announced plans to raise up to Y80bn ( Dollars 649m ) in straight bonds on domestic and overseas markets by the middle of this year . This will be the first bond issue by any of the seven operating units of the rail group . The announcement follows last year 's decision by the Ministry of Transport to postpone privatisation of the railway units due to the sluggishness of the Japanese stock markets . The move is expected to promote further expansion of the domestic corporate bond market . Companies are turning to the Japanese straight bond market , originally seen as immature because of rigid issuance restrictions and an illiquid secondary market . Last year , due to the stock market slump which made large equity-linked financing difficult , and to the loosening of restrictions by the Ministry of Finance , the straight bond market saw an increase in straight bond issues . In 1991 , domestic straight bond issues totalled Y2,380bn , up 30 per cent from 1990 , and issues in the Euro market rose 2.5 times to Y3,500bn . East Japan Railway said that it would continue to tap the straight bond market for fund-raising . The company needs funds for instalment payments for the 'Bullet Train ' facilities worth Y3,100bn . East Japan Railway must repay Y150bn of maturing long-term debt this year , and the unit plans to spend Y200bn in capital investments in the year to March 1993 . East Japan Railway said that issue terms and details of the bonds have yet to be fixed . The remaining railway units , including Central Japan Railway and West Japan Railway , are expected to follow suit by raising funds through the corporate bond market .
