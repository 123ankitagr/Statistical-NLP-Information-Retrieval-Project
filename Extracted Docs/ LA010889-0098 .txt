a few members of the san diego high school boys basketball team wandered into the gym after practice to check out a girls game between san diego and point loma its halftime but the only reason the teams will play two more quarters is that the rule book requires it point loma has put this game away early thats not the score is it says one player pointing to the scoreboard that reads point loma 44 san diego 14 yup says another what kind of a score is that asks a nearby spectator the answer is easy its the kind teams get used to when they play point loma 151 the class of the city eastern league and the team to beat in san diego county vista of the palomar league ranks close behind but point loma scored a 5444 knockout victory over the panthers 122 in a spirited battle that featured point lomas slick point guard monica filer and vistas 6feet 4inch center chris enger filer or as the back of her warmup jacket reads lady ice is a little girl 56 with big stats and was a preseason allamerican in street and smith magazine filer swerves around defenses flips nolook passes to teammates breaks into a smile with equal speed after the ensuing layup and is just a general paininthezone for opponents she has been for four seasons three as a starter enger named to usa todays super 25 team is appropriately dominant inside in scoring 273 points per game and rebounding 118 the countys players look up to her literally and figuratively her shots get blocked about as often as people get real butter on popcorn at the movies among the other teams in the county santana is good poway and patrick henry are having nice seasons but the difference is that santana poway and patrick henry dont have enger or filer right now as far as experience and overall talent vista and point loma probably have the best teams vista coach joe demaria said enger and filer are the two reasons why our teams are as good as they are filer averages 233 points but her true joy is passing fancy she learns her stuff going to the gym and playing with the guys she got used to being a passer rather than a shooter when she played with terri mann an allamerican who led the pointers to four consecutive state titles from 198487 mann didnt have trouble handling filers rocket passes and filer didnt hesitate to try anything terri and i would go to the gym and play ball and a guy would do a nice move and id say hey terri im going to try that next time we play enger doesnt need to fool around those nice short turnaround shots will do just fine when given the opportunity why not take the easy way no need to shoot from the perimeter its a lot easier to take 6 or 7foot bank shots demaria said sometimes its too easy so it seems vista and point loma have won a few games by lopsided scores this season vista clubbed san dieguito tuesday 6220 the final score of point lomas victory over san diego wednesday was 7329 and therein lies the problem the girls want to play hard but if they run up ridiculous scores people complain because of its fullcourt press point loma hears a lot more complaints than vista pointer coach lee trepanier received an anonymous letter from an angry parent after his team routed mt miguel 9710 this season trepanier figures he knows his business better than parents and fans so he doesnt usually pay much attention to negative mail im not changing my style of coaching for anybody trepanier said i think i know a little bit about the game i dont have to explain to parents how to run the team mt miguel coach sue stinchcomb doesnt expect explanations but she doesnt necessarily approve either theyre ruthless she said it bothers me but i cant blame point loma for doing it its not something i would do point loma proved vincible last season when it was knocked out of the playoffs by mount carmel in the semifinals and was thus dethroned after four consecutive cif section and state titles this season against chino a team with superior frontline height the pointers lost for the first time at home since 1980 but trepanier has no regrets if you dont play the best he said you never know what you can do san diegos best have met for the last time this year point loma a division ii school opted to compete in division i this year because vista stayed in division ii it wont have a chance for the muchsought rematch i think we could beat them enger said it wouldnt be at their home gym where we played them before i still see terri mann there in my mind separating vista and point loma for the san diego playoffs should allow both teams to compete at the state tournament strengthening the representation from san diego santana 102 heads the list of other top teams in the county the sultans of the grossmont 2a league are led by two talented forwards junior rebecca aase and sophomore stephanie thompson poway 106 probably wont challenge vista for the palomar title but has been consistent and balanced this season led by guardforward dawn gigstad 101 points per game guard christy fortney 10 and center laura nugent 93 patrick henry 104 of the city eastern league is coasting along behind forwardguard sorri epps 16point average and center rochelle johnson 20
