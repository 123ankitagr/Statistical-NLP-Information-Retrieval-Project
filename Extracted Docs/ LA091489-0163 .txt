While expressing support for Boys Town USA 's proposal to build five homes in Trabuco Canyon for troubled and needy youths , the Orange County Board of Supervisors on Wednesday sent the project back to the Planning Commission for a new environmental review . The commission approved the project in August , prompting a preservationist group , the Rural Canyons Conservation Fund , to file a lawsuit charging that the project violated zoning guidelines for grading and ridgeline development in the area northeast of Mission Viejo . Environmentalists also wanted Boys Town USA to explain what it plans to do with the portion of its 76-acre parcel that is not developed . Boys Town USA spent $ 1.6 million last year to buy the property and develop its first campus in the western United States to care for abused and neglected youths . The group , encouraged by the county 's Social Services Agency to locate here , has proposed building five 3,900-square-foot homes on five acres along a ridge between Rose and Hickey canyons not far from Trabuco Canyon Road . About six to eight youths ages 9 to 15 would live in each house . Environmentalists argue that the group has enough acreage to build the homes on flatter land , where they would be less visible and cause less disruption to wildlife habitat and views . There are also concerns that the group might develop single-family homes on the rest of the acreage . In praising the project , supervisors sent the project back to the Planning Commission for additional study to satisfy community concerns about its impact . Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez also suggested that the five Boys Town homes be built on a minimum of three acres each to provide more open space . A Boys Town USA representative said the group has no intention of developing the balance of its property in the near future .
