the fear diets ultimately fail dieters metabolism becomes abnormally sluggish appears unfounded researchers report todays journal american medical assn but said longterm weight loss still difficult maintain reasons poorly understood the findings similar reported recently usc researcher experts previously assumed drop weight triggered permanent corresponding drop resting metabolic rate amount energy body requires rest maintain basic physiological functions heart rate respiration a permanently lowered resting metabolic rate would mean dieter would burn calories rapidly might regain weight trouble shedding pounds however new studies university pennsylvania show overweight women also exercised taken verylowcalorie diet metabolism bounced back level normal new lower body weight the findings important individuals attempting medically supervised dieting some experts feared verylowcalorie diets liquid diets put body starvation mode slowing metabolism rate thwarted significant weight loss theoretically least dieting work researchers still dont understand hard many people permanently keep weight said thomas a wadden associate professor psychology university pennsylvania school medicine statistics tell us extremely difficult keep weight people still work hard despite favorable metabolic findings wadden said studies shown extreme dieting triggers plunge metabolic rate but change metabolic rate affects longterm weight control subject much research debate we long known people diet metabolic rate falls sharply and cut back calories metabolic rate falls wadden said but ever come back stay that trying assess the study followed 18 women weighing average 216 pounds 48 weeks nine women received conventional diet 1200 calories day 48 weeks the nine placed verylowcaloried liquidformula diet optifast 16 weeks followed conventional reducing diet all women increased physical activity walking after five weeks resting metabolic rate dropped groups significantly verylowcalorie dieters but metabolic rate rose groups after 48 weeks metabolic rates groups 9 lower start study weight reduced 16 19 after people lost 40 50 pounds metabolic rate lower that reduction metabolic rate anticipated takes less fuel keep lighter body going heavier body wadden said what dont longterm suppression metabolic rate due effects dieting over long term metabolic rate increases level appropriate new reduced body weight the results mirror similar study performed usc dr ken fujioka san diegobased researcher in study obese women placed 650calorie diet 10 weeks fujioka found dieters metabolic rates fell proportion weight loss waddens finding even diets 420 calories trigger longterm metabolic suppression significant fujioka said the question many calories go permanently lower metabolic rate im surprised number 420 calories said because metabolic rate lower dieting however dieters still needed consume fewer calories maintain weight loss wadden said generally 25 pounds lost dieter cut back 100 calories day wadden also noted women study also exercised factor might important boosting metabolic rate its important exercise youre dieting said the exercise preserves muscle tissue muscle tissue higher metabolic rate moreover know exercise single known predictor longterm weight loss in related study published earlier year stanford researchers found men dieted exercise experienced suppressed metabolic rate but overweight men lost weight exercise diet experienced reduction metabolic rates weve always held would better overweight people increase exercise rely totally extremely lowcalorie diets said peter wood stanford exercise less likely permanent effect resting metabolic rate makes easier people maintain weight future but wadden said researchers clues maintain longterm weight loss im afraid cant say lose weight never regain
