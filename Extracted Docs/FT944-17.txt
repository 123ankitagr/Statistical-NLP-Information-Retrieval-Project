in the interests of safety an ordinary motorway contraflow requires about 10000 road cones in view of the number of roads currently under repair this means there are probably more than 3m cones in use in britain alone by the year 2000 the highways agency forecasts 37 per cent of britains motorway network could be operating above its design capacity in other words over a third of its main roads will be either blocked with cars or coned off for repair we are moving into the era of king cone in the gloucestershire hamlet of broughton poggs this news is cause for optimism broughton poggs is the home of peter cook safety products the worlds leading producer of cones every week they make 25000 of them david morgan the companys managing director and inventor of the plastic cone even collects them he has 570 in his garage morgan produced the first pvc cone in 1967 while he was working at ici and experimenting with liquid polythene it was my job to make products using a rotating moulding machine i tried designing hollow toys one was an elephant but when i pulled it out of the mould the trunk kept breaking off i drove over a wooden police cone going to work one day and realised it was the perfect shape for my machine in 1973 he was invited to set up a cone manufacturing plant for british telecom and he has been making and collecting them ever since morgan was runnerup in a recent british television vote for the most boring man in britain the winner collected brown paper bags but how could anyone want to surround himself with objects that symbolise danger and frustration for me road cones hold an extraordinary fascination and i can spot a different design at 100 yards he says i search for different styles everywhere i travel and then barter for new discoveries with swaps in my boot the prizes in his collection include a fivesided cone he picked up in manchester a malaysian version he found on a beach in the scilly isles and one from his own company which floated ashore while he was on holiday in corsica i took it through the red channel at heathrow customs but the man said we havent got a category for that ok carry on the adaptability of these coloured plastic sentries is immense they turn up guarding wet paint or washed floors in public buildings on football training grounds or at cycling proficiency test centres as accessories in student bedsits and as chewable toys for young pit bull terriers morgan spotted one suspended over a naked bulb outside a brothel in amsterdam and he recently received a video from a zookeeper of a polar bear playing with one swimming with it and storing his food in it watch news at ten every day and therell always be one of mine somewhere he says they possess great authority motorists manoeuvre obediently around them even when they have strayed from their original position the key is to keep them upright a horizontal cone is usually ignored and for this reason a legion of workers pour 20 tons of sand a day into the blackplastic base morgan has done well from the cones he runs a highly successful 24hour manufacturing business with a pounds 9m turnover britain with the best road safety record in the world has persuaded other countries to invest in cones and 20 per cent of their sales are overseas mostly to mainland europe but morgan sells cones to police forces and traffic authorities as far away as saudi arabia and china as well as large and engineering companies across the uk we get orders from all over the world says morgan one of ours was pulled out of the sea by a man in fiji and he requested 5000 morgans company makes everything from the diminutive 13inch traffic cone to the giant highwayman personalised wedding cones decorated with lace and frills are available to order and morgan sells about 50 special black funeral cones a week he has even diversified into road signs barrier systems flashing lamps and paint for marking out white and yellow lines but the production of around 15m cones a year is still the chief preoccupation of the 65 staff at the broughton poggs plant in britain the 365page traffic sign regulation and general directions booklet gives precise dimensions and colours of cones and the layout needed for certain types of traffic control cones are forever getting stolen mangled or discoloured so there is always fresh demand is morgan proud of his job well its not something i admit to socially but its quite satisfying knowing my product sees people through road works safely what if there is a decline in road building thats fine old worn out roads are better for us but if and when work starts on extending the m25 to 14 lanes were going to have a big party
