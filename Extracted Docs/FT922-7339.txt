russia is continuing to build big warships despite funding problems and its submarine operations have hardly been affected by the dissolution of the soviet union a western naval authority said yesterday capt richard sharpe editor of jane's fighting ships the 1992-93 edition of which was published yesterday said production of nuclear missile-carrying submarines had come to a temporary halt last year but three nuclear-powered hunter-killer submarines and three diesel-powered craft had been launched he warned that proliferation of submarine expertise was one of the main problems posed by the break-up of the soviet union iran is said to be interested in buying one or two diesel-powered submarines of the former soviet union's 24 naval yards 14 were now under civilian control captain sharpe predicted that if this trend continued russia would probably have only two major submarine yards with perhaps another two yards producing large surface vessels and three building minor warships however at least three of these yards were each equivalent to any other naval yard in the world
