russia is continuing to build big warships despite funding problems and its submarine operations have hardly been affected by the dissolution of the soviet union a western naval authority said yesterday capt richard sharpe editor of janes fighting ships the 199293 edition of which was published yesterday said production of nuclear missilecarrying submarines had come to a temporary halt last year but three nuclearpowered hunterkiller submarines and three dieselpowered craft had been launched he warned that proliferation of submarine expertise was one of the main problems posed by the breakup of the soviet union iran is said to be interested in buying one or two dieselpowered submarines of the former soviet unions 24 naval yards 14 were now under civilian control captain sharpe predicted that if this trend continued russia would probably have only two major submarine yards with perhaps another two yards producing large surface vessels and three building minor warships however at least three of these yards were each equivalent to any other naval yard in the world
