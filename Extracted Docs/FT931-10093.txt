new zealand's apple growers are in a buoyant mood as they pick the new season's fruit thanks to the japanese the export outlook has never been rosier from june new zealand looks set to be the first major apple producer in the world to be able to export its fruit to japan which has a keen appetite for the fruit this depends on final acceptance by the japanese that new zealand can effectively control various moth parasites new zealand exporters acknowledge however that gaining a sizeable share of this market will not be easy for a start the japanese prefer larger rosy coloured apples of a type they do not now produce and the condition must be superb luckily new zealand which has been pioneering new varieties for world markets believes it could have the answer in an unnamed variety still known as gs2085 in the meantime exporters hope the japanese might be persuaded to eat granny smiths royal gala and some other export varieties the optimism follows the agreement in principle reached late last year on the treatment of new zealand apple pests mr joe pope chief executive of the apple and pear marketing board says he is very confident that the agreement will soon be formalised but it represents a huge challenge japan is the most demanding market in the world and our success there depends only on our ability to perform he says that apples are at present a high-priced luxury in japan the large blemish-free fruit produced domestically are virtually hand reared as each apple is grown it is put into a succession of paper bags to protect it apples are sold individually with a family dividing one up between them mr pope says new zealand will have to develop varieties for this market although royal gala would seem suitable as would the new variety gs2085 that will have considerable potential there he says at present only korea is permitted to export tiny quantities of apples to japan so new zealand has scored something of a coup mr pope claims he warns however that the us is also working hard at securing a similar agreement with japan and might be as little as six months behind new zealand
