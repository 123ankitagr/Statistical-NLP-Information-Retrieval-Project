Like a prizefighter returning to the ring after a long layoff , `` Raging Bull '' has come back to movie theaters after a 10-year absence and scored a quick knockout at the box office . Although 1980 's `` Raging Bull '' has enjoyed repeat appearances on television , cable and home video , the film grossed $ 16,311 over the last weekend while playing in just two theaters in New York and Los Angeles . `` It 's a good opening , and we 're very happy about it , '' said Jack Foley , president of distribution for MGM/UA . `` A lot of people have n't seen the movie . '' Older films , such as `` Laurence of Arabia , '' tend to sit on the shelf much longer than did `` Raging Bull . '' The film 's prompt re-release is also unusual because the movie is so readily available elsewhere . Foley said that he hoped to expand the film 's distribution to San Francisco , Washington , Boston , Chicago , Seattle and other key movie markets soon , and he said he hoped that it could move into scores of theaters in coming weeks . Renewed interest in the film was sparked in part by the selection of `` Raging Bull '' as the best film of the 1980s , as voted by American Film and Premiere magazines and the film critics Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel , among others . `` Raging Bull '' stars Robert De Niro as boxer Jake LaMotta in a dark drama of one man and his many demons . De Niro won a best actor Oscar for his work . The film was directed by Martin Scorsese , and co-stars Cathy Moriarty , Joe Pesci and Frank Vincent . Foley said that MGM/UA has spent just less than $ 100,000 re-releasing the movie , and that `` it 's going to take a long time to break even . '' He said MGM/UA struck new prints of the film from the original negatives so that moviegoers would see the film in its pristine state . When first released , `` Raging Bull '' was hardly a blockbuster , collecting $ 22 million , Foley said . But it has long been admired as one of the classics of contemporary American cinema .
