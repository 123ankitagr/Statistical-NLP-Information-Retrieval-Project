When a speaker at a conference on advertising accountability * gives a paper called '24 ways to con a client ' accompanied by 'You got ta pick a pocket or two ' from the musical 'Oliver ] ' , fireworks are bound to follow . Last week , John Terriss , vice chairman of the CIA Group , one of the UK's largest media buying agencies , delivered just such a paper . He claimed that some media buying agencies were increasingly resorting to dubious practices such as 'slushing ' - illicitly transferring funds from one client 's account to boost the advertising spend of another - or , simply , to fabricating the sale of TV advertising space . Even though Terriss is not a neutral player , his assertions must alarm advertisers given that some Pounds 1.6bn is spent annually on television advertising space in the UK . His concern was less to attack malpractice but more to argue for greater auditing of media buying and advertising to boost the industry's credibility . His fellow speakers , both advertisers and advertising agencies , all addressed the same basic issue ; how , in a recession , to ensure that money spent on advertising is worthwhile ? There was no consensus . One agency said it had jettisoned the traditional 15 per cent commission system in favour of one based more on payment by achieving pre-agreed aims . Advertisers disputed the value of using agencies ; all demanded greater evidence of advertising 's accountability . Robert Lauterborn , principal of the transatlantic marketing services agency Morgan , Anderson , said : 'Gone is the blind faith that advertising is good and lots of advertising is better ; therefore , gone is the system that paid agencies simply to create and place that advertising ' . * Advertising Accountability and the Client-Agency Relationship ; organised by Westminster Management Consultants .
