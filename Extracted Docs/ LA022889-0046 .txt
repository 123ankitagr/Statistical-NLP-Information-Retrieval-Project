question do bran cereals really provide as much fiber as the manufacturers claim this seems to be one of the biggest selling points lately for all kinds of cereals answer some bran cereals do provide substantial amounts of fiber as much as 9 grams for each serving however i suggest you check on the fat and sugar content of the cereal before making a choice q i would appreciate it if you would clarify the amount of sodium a person should have my husband is well over 6 feet tall and weighs 220 pounds im a foot shorter and weigh a hundred pounds less it doesnt make sense that we should both take in the same amount of sodium does the difference in size make any difference in this a the amount of sodium an individual is permitted is related to the number of calories he or she consumes each day obviously you and your husband do not consume the same number of calories a teaspoon of salt contains 2300 milligrams of sodium you should limit your consumption of sodium to no more than 1000 milligrams for every 1000 calories you consume thus you and your husband would not have the same sodium intake
