in many bars and night clubs in the far east almost every other bottle of spirits sold is a counterfeit according to international investigator wayne grant the usual trick is to supply the first bottle of the correct spirits usually a brand of cognac then when the clients have had plenty to drink and they order another the bartenders substitute a bottle of cheap brandy made in cyprus spain or elsewhere in a bottle expertly disguised as the real thing said grant grant international tracks down the counterfeiters and supplies the appropriate law enforcement agency with enough information to apprehend them it is a highly specialised and often dangerous task but one to which grant a 6ft 2ins 19stone former thames valley police detective is well suited when i entered the force as a 19 yearold 29 years ago i had absolutely no idea that i would end up controlling a company with a turnover of pounds 18m and a staff of 85 grant said in many ways i still do not regard myself as a particularly good businessman it just so happened that i was fascinated with the process of investigation and when i was offered the chance to come out of the force at the age of 31 and join an international cigarette company as a security specialist it was an offer i couldnt refuse after that it was a matter of luck and the fact that to do my job well i had to build up a bank of information that has subsequently proved valuable to many major manufacturers of the worlds fastest moving commodities that information has been the key to the grant success story grant stayed with rothmans for four years during that time he decided to form his own specialised international investigation agency in 1980 grant used half his pounds 3000 severance pay to travel to the us and sign two cigarette companies as his first clients grant international now has more than 60 clients in various industries who pay retainers ranging from pounds 12000 to pounds 70000 a year in that first year grant calculates that he travelled round the world 20 times while his wife carole dealt with the administration from the family home in bicester turnover in the first year was pounds 187000 of which more than half was profit it was achieved not only through negotiating retainers but also through much directed specific investigations work it was a good beginning and gave grant a cash base on which to build the company the main problem in that year was keeping up with my sleep and explaining to my bank in what was then a small country town why i had such a huge appetite for cash grant said even in those days one weeks travel budget could total as much as pounds 10000 as most of the international companies he was trading with paid on a 60day basis grant international had cash flow problems in the early years once the bank realised just exactly what i was doing it as good as gold grant said unlike many small businessmen i can honestly say i have experienced nothing but help from my bank lloyds turnover roughly doubled in each of the first 10 years but growth has tailed off slightly since 1989 for the past four years we have added roughly pounds 100000 to our turnover each year which our accountant says is very satisfactory said grant our profit before tax in our last trading year was pounds 550000 on a turnover of pounds 18m grant said the slowdown was not due to the recession but because in some sectors he had reached saturation point it is possible to expand however by undertaking more directed work for individual clients this is because counterfeiting is a growth industry particularly since the opening up of the former the ussr grant international works for all the 28 largest liquor producers in the world and for most of the large cigarette manufacturers the biggest decision each year is which industries to enter to expand the grant operation this year the new industry was food there was also an expansion of work for manufacturers of crystal jewellery in both industries the growing problem is not so much one of counterfeiting as one of the grey market otherwise known as parallel trading many large producers export the same goods at different prices to different countries but this means that local traders can often quite legally divert the goods and make a profit for many years this has been a big problem with industries such as tobacco drinks and confectionery all of which depend on a high volume and comparatively low price products grant said the task for grant international therefore is to pinpoint the culprits and advise client companies of ways of overcoming the leakage grant has paid employees and contract staff in some 30 countries who act chiefly as intelligence gatherers a very high proportion of the work is the stuff of which daytoday detective work is made from hard intelligent daytoday grind with the spark and the inspiration to know when to act on a hunch grant said six of our 15 headquarters staff in bicester and a good proportion of our overseas employees are former police there is nothing quite like a police training in this sort of work grant has been present at a dozen or so big raids but many of his staff never see such drama their lives are spent on the end of a phone or at a computer screen talking to and paying local contacts and analysing data such as export statistics a surprising amount of which is public information if you know where to find it nevertheless there can be risks two years ago two of his investigators were killed and a third seriously injured in mexico when a lorry drove into their car on a mountain road they were investigating a swindle involving the resale of cheap white rum grants nightmare is the unsuccessful raid the worst thing i can imagine is spending tens of thousands of pounds of clients money involving the local police and customs authorities only to go in and find its the genuine stuff he said but i would be very surprised if it happened we proudly proclaim that we have bought a successful outcome to every enquiry bought to us but we could be set up it is a good reason for remaining on our toes international 8587 churchill road bicester oxon ox6
