What a shame it was to attend the San Diego State-Miami game and have only 34,200 other `` real fans '' attend . I 'm sure next season the typical San Diego sports fans ( also called `` front-runners '' ) will begin to show up and support the Aztec football program . Al Luginbill has turned the program around and is a top-notch coach . Look for San Diego State in the Top 20 for years to come . Maybe then , even the front-runners will regularly attend games .
