united airlines said tuesday that it will begin service from the ontario airport in san bernardino county to oakland on july 5 with special introductory fares that will be the lowest implemented since major carriers began discounting fares in the california market about six weeks ago however southwest airlines immediately matched united's special 25 and 29 fares united would not disclose what its fare structure will be after the brief introductory period but said its fares will remain competitive and will be the lowest of any carrier serving the oakland-ontario market southwest interprets that statement to mean that united will match its regular 49, unrestricted one-way fare on the oakland-ontario route said david brown southwest's chief spokesman no other carrier so far has matched this regular 49 fare brown vowed however that southwest will not be undersold for 20 years we have been dedicated to having the lowest fare in any market we serve we see no reason to change that business philosophy brown said the ontario-oakland market is a heavily traveled route united spokeswoman sara dornacker said we would like to make some inroads into that local market united said it will begin oakland-ontario service with a 25 one-way fare good for travel between july 5 and july 12, provided that the ticket is purchased between june 10 and july 4 the special fare structure also includes a 29 one-way fare without an advance purchase requirement but good for travel only between july 5 and july 15 southwest started trend a spokeswoman said the fares will be available for every seat on every flight during those periods southwest said it will match those fares in every detail southwest a small dallas-based carrier is credited by some with starting this spring's widespread discounting in the california market it has distinguished itself from the other carriers by offering the 49 unrestricted fare for every seat on each of its six daily nonstop oakland-ontario flights and five daily nonstops between oakland and san diego southwest also offers a 29 one-way 21-day advance purchase fare for those routes which has been matched by other carriers
