what kind of car do you buy if you have a large family the fashionable solution is a multi-purpose vehicle mpv like the nissan serena i wrote about last week there is no doubt that mpvs have a lot going for them as people-carriers one version of the serena and the larger toyota previa takes up to eight a renault espace or a mitsubishi space wagon seats up to seven but there is a snag where does the luggage go when an mpv is carrying its full quota of people the answer mostly on the floor or a roof rack not even the previa has more than a modest amount of proper luggage room when all eight of its seats are filled and the spare pair that make an espace or space wagon or 4 x 4 s like the land rover discovery into a 6 7-seater take up what is normally the load space with one exception the handful of conventionally-shaped 6 7-seat estate cars are no better rover montego mercedes-benz 200-300 and volvo 940 estates become seven-seaters only when their rear-facing occasional seats for children are pulled up from the load compartment floor friends of mine who had five young daughters and a holiday home in france side-stepped the problem neatly they bought a pair of renault 4 s and split the girls between them there was plenty of room for luggage in two boots an alternative could have been one of the genuine family estate cars that were a french speciality for years peugeot and citroen made stretched seven-seat versions of their biggest estate cars the 405 and 505, ds and cx because they were longer in body and wheelbase they had room for three rows of face-forward seats plus a fair amount of luggage sadly for parents of large families they are not made any more last to go was the peugeot 505 familiale a gentle giant of a car even with seven on board it had a load floor 29 in deep and 51 in wide 72 cm x127cm behind the third row of seats this bench was habitable by adults and plenty big enough for two children to be comfortable on a journey with middle and rear rows of seats folded flat the familiale had a load floor 83 in 207 cm long they come larger only in vans so where are the family estates today gone but not forgotten so far as peugeot and citroen are concerned the 505 lived on for a time after the 605 appeared but is no longer made peugeot says there will never be a 605-based estate car citroen denies any intention of adding a stretched familiale estate with three rows of forward-facing seats to its xm range the only one of the breed still surviving although i fear not for much longer is the renault savanna it is not as big as the 505 and cx but at least it allows parents to carry four offspring fastened safely in child seats and facing forward plus some luggage the savanna nevada on mainland europe with up to seven seats is listed at between pounds 11,810 and pounds 12,770 you can pay more than that for a low-mileage h or j-registered peugeot 505 2.5 grd familiale in mint condition if you are lucky enough to find one its citroen counterpart the cx22 rs will be much cheaper around pounds 4,000 but older g-registration models were the last to be sold in britain
