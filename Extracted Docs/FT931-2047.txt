THE Andean Development Fund , awarded last week an investment-grade rating by Standard & Poor 's , is planning a Eurodollar bond issue next month if market conditions permit . The BBB rating for the fund - known by its Spanish acronym CAF and owned by the governments of Bolivia , Colombia , Ecuador , Peru and Venezuela - makes it the second Latin borrower to achieve investment grade status . The other is the government of Chile , which was awarded the same rating last year and is unlikely to be an active borrower . Mr Enrique Garcia , the fund 's executive president , said a Dollars 75m five-year issue - its first in the public bond markets - was planned next month , with Chemical Bank as lead underwriter . The fund wants to make further bond issues this year in other markets , such as the Yankee bond market in the US and Japan 's Samurai market .
