To visit or not to visit ? Japan is agonising over whether its Emperor Akihito should drop in on Pearl Harbour when he makes his first state visit to the US next month . He visited Pearl Harbour when he was crown prince . But now he is the emperor and some of his advisers are questioning whether he should be seen paying his respects at Pearl Harbour 's Arizona National Memorial , a monument for victims of Japan 's air attack in 1941 . Rightwing politicians in Japan argue that no US president has ever visited Hiroshima or Nagasaki , destroyed by atom bombs . So why should their emperor apologise for an attack which many still believe Japan was tricked into mounting by the US ? Japan 's qualms about showing remorse over its actions of 50 years ago are not going to go away . After all , there is the tricky question of how the world is going to celebrate the 50th anniversary of VJ Day - August 15 1945 .
