SHARES in Galen Health Care , a large operator of private US hospitals , rose sharply yesterday following the announcement of a Dollars 3.2bn share-exchange merger with Columbia Hospital Corporation . The deal will create America 's largest for-profit hospital chain . The new company , to be called Columbia Healthcare Corporation , will operate 99 hospitals and have annual revenues of over Dollars 5bn . Wall Street warmly welcomed the deal , which was announced after the market closed on Thursday . It involves Galen investors receiving 0.775 shares in the much smaller Columbia for each of the 160m shares of Galen outstanding . Stock in Columbia rose yesterday morning on the Nasdaq over-the-counter market to Dollars 26 1/4 at lunchtime , up Dollars 3/4 , while Galen rose Dollars 4 5/8 to Dollars 18 3/4 . Columbia , with 26 hospitals in the southern US , is a fast growing chain which acquires groups of hospitals in a particular geographical area and then consolidates them to lower costs and boost occupancy rates . Galen , which is about three times Columbia 's size , was spun off earlier this year from Humana , a hospital and health insurance company .
