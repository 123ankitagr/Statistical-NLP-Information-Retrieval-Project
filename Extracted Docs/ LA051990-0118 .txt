With construction of a new Courthouse under way , the Municipal Court building on Cochran Street in Simi Valley will soon be available for other uses . The city is accepting proposals from government and nonprofit groups until June 15 for alternate uses of about half of the 8,000-square-foot building . The new Courthouse should be completed in November , and space in the Cochran Street building will be available after that , said Bob Heitzman , the city 's deputy city manager . The Simi Valley Police Department , located next door to the Courthouse , plans to use about half the building for office space . The move will `` allow us to expand our Police Department a little bit , '' Heitzman said . The areas still available for use include the courtroom and other office space . Although no proposals have been submitted yet , Heitzman said , several agencies have shown an interest in the space . The county 's Historical Society and Mental Health Department and the Red Cross are among those interested in acquiring the office space . Heitzman said a performing arts facility has also been proposed . Although the county is not requiring that groups pay rent for the facility , Heitzman said , the amount of rent a group offers to pay will be one of the city 's considerations in choosing who will occupy the space .
