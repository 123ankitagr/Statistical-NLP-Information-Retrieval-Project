recently we have seen a number of proposals to alleviate the horrific traffic problems in los angeles including a lunkheaded notion to use the la river as an adjunct freeway and a facetious proposal to create the worlds most expensive bike path but is the idea of a city bike path really so offthewall obviously opening the la river to automobile traffic would be environmentally disastrous as well as counterproductive it would only encourage more commuters to drive worsening the problems of smog without lessening congestion why not convert the existing banks of the la river to a twoway bicycle path the idea is hardly farfetched in europe many freeways have bicycle paths along them converting the river banks to bicycle paths would encourage people to bike rather than drive the cost would be minimal indeed and planting trees along the banks of the river would both beautify the area and help clear the air of pollutants mark g roberts los angeles
