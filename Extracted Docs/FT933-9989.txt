when the 1971 rock musical godspell was new here i was too sophisticated to go to see it now that my brow has dropped a bit i have been looking forward to catching up with a show that so moved many of my generation but you would have to have your brow around your ankles to take this revival seriously it is pointless it is insincere its jesus story here is virtually stripped of plot and jesus himself becomes a a joyless wimp and b a pontificating creep and worst crime in a musical the songs are sold short you hear spirituals without spirit soul anthems without soul rock numbers without rock music and text have been heftily revised the show wants to recapture the feeling of 1971, yet also wants to be tuned in to now someone even says fatted calf oh paul gascoigne everyone onstage is dressed in the way-in carnaby street gear of pre-'71 fashion the nastiest bellbottoms i've seen in 20 years but one of them makes a joke about wearing reeboks the disciples keep re-telling jesus's parables in various showbiz guises the prodigal son story is like a crimebusters report and the story of seed cast upon stony weedy or fertile ground is re-told like an episode of blind date usually these comic turns seem only to send up jesus's original stories yet at least they are lively whereas jesus himself is a drab when he explains to cilla that she has missed the point of blind date's seed parable you want the ground to swallow him up cilla as it happens is imitated with happy panache by gemma craven who is also the only interesting singer in the cast of 12 as soon as she starts to sing day by day you know that here is a properly supported voice individual in timbre singing calmly and steadily but with a simple authority that actually sounds heartfelt pity about her hairdo however the way the show wastes her talents is beyond belief in both that number and by my side other voices soon drown hers the way that other singers have been encouraged to coarsen famous songs like bless the lord and turn back o man is dismal andy crane he of children's tv tries not very hard to be jesus and his singing is grey limp and often flat in the garden of gethsemane he asks what can none of you stay awake one hour with me answer if we can it's no thanks to you dear james gaddas judas has more sheer presence though no more persuasiveness in a largely speaking role mark greenstreet displays rather more force and sexiness than you might have believed from his work on trainer but no-one could really to be said to act and some of the cute interplay among the ensemble is embarrassing both the director lindsay dolan and the musical director steve brooker do this show no service but since stephen schwartz the original composer has abetted them with new lyrics he must take blame too i wonder if even in 1971 the show honestly brought off its attempt to make the word of god go down like a rock concert several of its songs are written for real singing but i remain suspicious of all that 1960 s god-is-for real-man the most interesting feature is the photos of oh yes jeremy irons in the original london staging because the casting and dialogue have been adjusted to ingratiate an audience steeped in modern tv this barbican revival will have some limited success nothing however about the first-night ovation was spontaneous at the barbican hall until august 30
