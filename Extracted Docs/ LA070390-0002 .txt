Question : If a teen-ager has an acne condition , how important is it that the face be washed ? I have known adolescents who were far from clean and who were never bothered with acne , and I have known others who appeared to be very clean who had a bad condition . How important is cleanliness in this ? Answer : I recommend patients with acne wash two or three times day , using a mild soap and water ; however , scrubbing the skin is not recommended . Acne is not caused by dirt . Scrubbing the skin will not improve the condition , and may even tend to aggravate it . If you have a medical question , write to Dr. Solomon , P.O .
