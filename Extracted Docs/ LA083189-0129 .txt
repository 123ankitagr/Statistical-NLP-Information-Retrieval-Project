Federal officials and wildlife experts announced plans Wednesday to split the world 's only captive flock of endangered whooping cranes to diminish the possibility of losing all 54 birds to a single epidemic or disaster . `` It 's just putting your eggs in two baskets instead of one , '' said David Thompson , an education specialist with the International Crane Foundation , a private , nonprofit organization specializing in the breeding of cranes . `` We 're talking about a whole species here . '' 22 Birds to Be Moved In November , 22 of the 54 birds will be moved from the Patuxent Wildlife Research Center in Laurel , Md. , to a breeding center at the International Crane Foundation 's headquarters in Baraboo , Wis . There are about 200 whooping cranes in existence , with the only self-sustaining wild flock consisting of about 140 birds that migrate between Wood Buffalo National Park in Canada and Aransas National Wildlife Refuge in Texas . Splitting the captive flock will also speed plans for a second self-sustaining wild flock of the regal white birds , which can stand 5 feet tall and have 5-foot wings with black tips , Thompson said . An attempt to establish a wild flock in the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge in Idaho was made in 1975 , but the birds have not produced eggs . That refuge is still home to 13 whooping cranes . 10 % of Wild Flock Lost The sole self-sustaining wild flock lost about 10 % of its population last winter during its migration south , Thompson said . John Turner , director of the Interior Department 's U.S . Fish and Wildlife Service , called the split of the captive flock a `` win-win situation for America 's premier endangered species . '' The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation is providing a grant of $ 200,000 for the construction of 12 to 15 pens to house the whooping crane flock at the Baraboo facility .
