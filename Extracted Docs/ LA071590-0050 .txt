in reply to justice suffers in sting of mayor barry by jesse jackson commentary july 8 after reading jacksons column i have several questions to ask who is on trial here washington mayor marion barry or the government was there probable cause that barry had used drugs and had lied about it jackson adroitly sidesteps the possibility that barry may be mentally sick and describes him as physically sick and chemically dependent should such a person head a city government furthermore should the government go after drug lords kingpins etc and not after users would there even be such people if there were no users finally if jackson believes the government singles out black politicians for prosecution which i doubt shouldnt black politicians behave in such a way that their actions appear beyond reproach would jackson have black politicians held to a lesser level of scrutiny than white politicians wouldnt that be the ultimate in patronizing robert s rodgers culver city
