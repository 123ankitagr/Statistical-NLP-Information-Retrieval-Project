In reply to `` Justice Suffers in 'Sting ' of Mayor Barry , '' by Jesse Jackson , Commentary , July 8 : After reading Jackson 's column , I have several questions to ask . Who is on trial here , Washington Mayor Marion Barry or the government ? Was there probable cause that Barry had used drugs and had lied about it ? Jackson adroitly sidesteps the possibility that Barry may be mentally sick and describes him as `` physically sick and chemically dependent . '' Should such a person head a city government ? Furthermore , should the government go after drug lords , kingpins , etc . and not after users ? Would there even be such people if there were no users ? Finally , if Jackson believes the government singles out black politicians for prosecution ( which I doubt ) , should n't black politicians behave in such a way that their actions appear beyond reproach ? Would Jackson have black politicians held to a lesser level of scrutiny than white politicians ? Would n't that be the ultimate in patronizing ? ROBERT S. RODGERS Culver City
