Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said today he was lukewarm about reentering the race to take control of Hollywood film studio MGM/UA Communications Co. , which terminated a $ 1.5-billion pact to be bought by Qintex Australia Ltd. MGM said its deal with the Australian broadcasting conglomerate Qintex failed because it did not deliver a required $ 50-million letter of credit . ( Section D , Page 1 . ) Murdoch was asked on Australian television if he still wanted MGM/UA after Qintex Australia 's plan fell apart . `` Ah , yes , '' he said . `` But we 're not negotiating . We 're not in there . We 're not sure about it . . . . We 're not lusting after it . '' A bid of $ 1.35 billion by Murdoch 's News Corp. was topped by Qintex last month . `` We are certainly not going to pay the price ( Qintex head ) Mr. ( Christopher C. ) Skase was going to pay , '' Murdoch said .
