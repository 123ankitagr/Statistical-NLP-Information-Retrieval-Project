i had the good fortune to work on an almost daily basis with irving berlin for close to two years at one time and for other shorter spans we had many conversations some of which i managed to record this was no minor accomplishment inasmuch as berlin a wiry supercharged individual aspired to assert complete control over any project with which he was associated he was almost always in motion seldom remaining seated for more than a few minutes unless he was at the piano he preferred to patrol the executive corridors at paramount studios where we worked or pace nervously in circles around his office frequently in shirt sleeves lost in introspection hands clasped behind his back torso bent slightly forward as he moved like an ice skater he was a genial man as sharp a businessman as he was a beguiling and perceptive poet berlin once told me with his customary candor that some of his output was trash nonetheless his ability to churn out songs so enchanting and timeless that their appeal spans generations and socioeconomic strata and national and racial boundaries is unrivaled in the annals of american music some songs just write themselves berlin said take cheek to cheek for instance it is quite a long involved song i wrote it for astaire and rogers in top hat i did it after dinner one evening while staying at the beverly wilshire hotel on the other hand i was not satisfied lyrically with always i had the tune finished for months but couldnt get the lyric right then one day i just adlibbed it and it worked for me lyrics are the hardest part theres no special recipe for success berlin told me some very good songs never got off the ground sometimes the timing is wrong and a good song dies it happens to all writers in my opinion cole porters begin the beguine is one of the greatest pieces of music written by anybody it was in a show called jubilee many years ago and it was a failure until much later artie shaw the bigband leader made a recording and everyone suddenly discovered it is a classic i wrote white christmas because i had to write a song about christmas for the show i was a good songwriter so i wrote a good song there are certain basic emotions not only in songwriting and play writing but also in making speeches or writing stories theres selfpity which is all alone or remember where you feel sorry for yourself theres happiness theres the straight love song like always theres the homesick song songs about dixie theres the patriotic song such as god bless america of course ive written songs that were failures you can be so clever that you write around your subject and become oblique your pencil becomes so sharp that you write from the outside rather than the inside were all amateurs until we write a hit and there are no basic rules when i started we were confined to an octave and maybe a note although alexanders ragtime band went beyond that then jerome kern came along and wrote two octaves or an octave and three quarters it didnt make a darn bit of difference because jerome kern had talent and a heart of gold and he just wrote great melodies i can give you all sorts of rules but you may go home and break them all and write the biggest hit ever written if youre a pro you write what you got ta write someone needs a ballad you write a ballad its a matter of talent some of the biggest hits ive had were written because we needed a ballad in the publishing house ive written many songs because the situation called for a boy and a girl to sing a love song take annie get your gun herbert and dorothy fields wrote the book about annie oakley who was a fantastic rifle shot the situations called for a love song so i wrote they say that falling in love is wonderful i thought that would be the big hit we all felt i got the sun in the mornin would be a rhythm smash annie get your gun has 16 songs its a true story frank butler was the worlds greatest marksman with a rifle but when buffalo bills wild west show in which butler starred came to town little annie oakley beat him buffalo bill asked annie to join his show but she didnt want to leave home i had to write a song that would sell her on the idea of coming along the glories of riding on a train the excitement i tried to wrap it up in one phrase and the phrase was theres no business like show business i wrote it as a throwaway song to advance the story line i didnt plan it as an anthem for show business but according to my ascap survey it is my mostperformed song not the biggest record seller but the mostperformed if youre a professional songwriter you write you write in the morning you write at night you write in a taxi or on the subway you have it in your mind until youre finished and even after its finished it may turn out to be very bad i have songs written years ago that id still like to change a professional songwriter doesnt work business hours he subconsciously gathers material and ideas all the time i dont have a notebook filled with titles or these ideas but theyre tucked away somewhere in memory theres one thing about longevity in this business you dont get holierthanthou you dont give something to the public with the attitude that well here it is and you damn better like it you try to guess what they want and then try to please them george m cohan was my ideal berlin said i tried to write like him he was the fellow who supplied special material to the guys who sang in the saloons when i was a kid i started by writing parodies of current songs by other composers at first i just wrote lyrics when i was a bit older i became a singing waiter and i want you to know i was a pretty good one at least i thought i was pretty good until we made the movie version of this is the army at warner brothers in which i sang oh how i hate to get up in the morning an electrician heard my prerecording and said that if the guy who wrote that song could hear this fellow sing it hed turn over in his grave my interest is principally in the creation of songs berlin once told me but we live in a country and society that is based on free enterprise just try buying a painting by picasso or cezanne and see what youll be charged around 1944 berlin bought up copyrights to all his songs they are still owned by his estate he refused more than one offer in the hundreds of millions of dollars for his catalogue claiming he would not know what to do with the money and the wouldbe purchasers would not know what to do with his music at his death berlin was still living in the house on beekman place in new york which he purchased in 1946 from its builder and original owner the late james forrestal onetime navy secretary we wanted to rent it but we couldnt so we bought it he remembered its on the east river in what is supposed to be a fashionable neighborhood but the east river doesnt impress me because they picked me out of the east river when i was a kid a little lower downtown perhaps but still the same river tugboats and all during his life berlin stubbornly resisted all offers to use his life story as the basis for a broadway musical or film he told me that when he died his children could make such a decision if they chose my private life is private but ill be very happy to talk about it he said puckishly we have a nice corner house in new york we spend out summers in the catskills and we go there in winter too theres lots of deer up there and snow i seldom relax my hobby is songwriting my wife and i used to go dancing but wed sooner sit and talk im not a good dancer im a very big eater i like good food i like to cook but they tell me i cook badly ive found if you buy good meat you should leave it alone the same as with a good song dont do too big of an arrangement berlin said the most important advice he would offer aspiring songwriters was never throw anything away during world war i i wrote a song at camp upton for a soldier show called yip yip yaphank he said i intended it as the finale but we didnt use it it went into the trunk in 1938 i was in london for the opening of alexanders ragtime band it was september near the time neville chamberlain came back from meeting hitler with his piece of paper about peace in our time i was distraught about the threat of war and when i returned to new york i wanted to write a patriotic song i wrote one called thanks america but it was a very sad song but the word america recalled the song i wrote 20 years earlier at camp upton i hauled it out of the trunk and rewrote it the first 16 bars and the last eight are exactly as they were written originally but i changed the middle because i wanted to write a song about peace not about war a short time afterwards when kate smith asked me to write a patriotic song for her i just gave her the revised version of the old song thus was god bless america rescued from the scrap heap it is my personal favorite song when last we talked berlin seemed interested in dispelling a myth about his keyboard ability people think i can only play that special piano with the movable keyboard i play in the key of f sharp which are the black keys years ago all fakers played that way we played by ear and the publishing companies had these transposing pianos because we could not transpose we really could not write music for me f sharp happened because the black keys are right under your fingers but as i progressed i got to know the relative keys i took lessons once or twice but i wasnt any good george m cohan had a couple of transposing pianos he played in the key of c which is also supposed to be easy eventually i began composing away from the piano i developed a system whereby i envisioned the keyboard in my mind and i could encode the proper notes on paper i work mainly with ideas i write words and music together one phrase at a time but i can play any piano today berlins old moveable piano stands mute in the smithsonian institution in washington
