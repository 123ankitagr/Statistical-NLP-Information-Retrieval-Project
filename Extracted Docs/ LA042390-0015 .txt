Nixon 's analysis of our options for lasting strength and peace as the Cold War winds down was brilliant , if cold-hearted and realistic . It was the missing link in comprehending some of Gorbachev 's real options . Thankfully , Nixon did not dredge up the inflammatory language of the Cold War that has forced the U.S. into inflexible strategies with peace as a peripheral consideration . Yet , like the memory of the thief who picked Nixon 's pocket in the Times Square celebration after World War II , the memory of a single phrase from his analysis nags at me . Nixon talked of Gorbachev 's popularity being greater than that of our President in Europe and `` among Americans with graduate degrees '' -- a nice back-handed slap that gives us non-graduate-degree Americans someone to hate . You can always count on that from Dick Nixon . In the midst of his most brilliant evaluation of foreign realities , he will insert his gross insecurity and petty contempt like knives into his own country , which is crying for leadership that will unify its people . To this day , he does n't understand that his biggest crime against this country was that he took the presidency -- one of the few unifying institutions we had left in America -- and squandered the investment of trust we had placed in it . Maybe that 's why we need Nixon 's voice on our Opinion pages , so we can lay aside our naivete and play tough-minded geopolitical hardball . But here in America , we 're still waiting for someone who can heal our wounds . JONI HALPERN San Diego
