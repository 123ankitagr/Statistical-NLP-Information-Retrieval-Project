nixons analysis of our options for lasting strength and peace as the cold war winds down was brilliant if coldhearted and realistic it was the missing link in comprehending some of gorbachevs real options thankfully nixon did not dredge up the inflammatory language of the cold war that has forced the us into inflexible strategies with peace as a peripheral consideration yet like the memory of the thief who picked nixons pocket in the times square celebration after world war ii the memory of a single phrase from his analysis nags at me nixon talked of gorbachevs popularity being greater than that of our president in europe and among americans with graduate degrees a nice backhanded slap that gives us nongraduatedegree americans someone to hate you can always count on that from dick nixon in the midst of his most brilliant evaluation of foreign realities he will insert his gross insecurity and petty contempt like knives into his own country which is crying for leadership that will unify its people to this day he doesnt understand that his biggest crime against this country was that he took the presidency one of the few unifying institutions we had left in america and squandered the investment of trust we had placed in it maybe thats why we need nixons voice on our opinion pages so we can lay aside our naivete and play toughminded geopolitical hardball but here in america were still waiting for someone who can heal our wounds joni halpern san diego
