Seven people died and 50 were reported missing because a low-caste 15-year-old bridegroom from India 's Taj Mahal town of Agra wanted to ride to his wedding on horseback , a local member of Parliament said today . Police in Agra , 125 miles south of Delhi , said they had arrested 200 people and were keeping four ghettos for Harijans -- the untouchables at the bottom of the Hindu caste hierarchy -- under curfew after the wedding sparked a caste war . Bridegroom Ram Deen , a Harijan , eventually rode to nearby Panwari village in a police jeep to marry 13-year-old Mundra while the army fought back thousands of enraged Jats , the caste of small landowners , in the village and police confronted thousands of Agra Harijans just outside .
