Gary Garcia , a candidate for the Los Angeles school board 's 2nd District seat in the April election , has announced his decision to withdraw from the race . Garcia , an English and history teacher at Hamilton High School , endorsed challenger Mark Slavkin over incumbent Alan Gershman . Garcia , whose campaign never picked up much support , said he was dropping out of the race to devote more time to his students . `` I am committed to my students , '' he said . `` I feel this is an important time to put extra effort into teaching to maintain my students ' confidence in our educational system . They have been very supportive of me in my desire to run for the board . Now , however , I think I may be most supportive of them by choosing not to divert any of my attention from teaching . ''
