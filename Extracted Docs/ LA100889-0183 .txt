Big Earl , runner-up to Sunday Silence in the Super Derby at Bossier , La. , on Sept. 24 , tested positive to more than the legal amount of phenylbutazone and probably will be disqualified , officials said . State racing steward C.L . Webb said a blood test after the race showed 9.3 milligrams of phenylbutazone -- nearly twice the legal limit . Disqualification would cost owner-trainer Jerry Cart his $ 200,000 share of the $ 1-million purse .
