The Travelers group of insurance companies Friday asked the California Supreme Court to overturn an order issued last week by state Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie requiring it to renew about 22,000 car insurance policies in California . Noting that four Travelers subsidiaries are seeking to withdraw from the auto insurance business in the state , Travelers Executive Vice President Thomas McAboy said the appeal contends that the company `` has a basic constitutional right to cease doing private passenger automobile business in California , '' regardless of any provisions to the contrary in Proposition 103 . During the appeal , Travelers has said it will renew all policies .
