a new bout of transatlantic fare wars loomed yesterday as american airlines one of the three largest us carriers said it would match the fare cuts on european routes initiated by its smaller rival continental airlines on monday continental which has been operating under bankruptcy court protection since late 1990, announced that it was reducing fares for winter travel in europe by an average of 35 per cent the reduced-price tickets apply to travel between december 27 and march 30, and must be purchased by december 31 continental's move cuts round trip fares from dollars 498-dollars 902, to dollars 358-dollars 498 the cheaper tickets would be non-refundable american's response is significant because it is a bigger transatlantic operator than continental and is likely to spur similar reductions from other big carriers this latest bout of price-cutting comes just as the us airline industry is reporting dismal figures for the third quarter of 1992
