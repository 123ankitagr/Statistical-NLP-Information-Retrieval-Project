John Raisian , acting director of the politically influential Hoover Institution think tank at Stanford University since last September , has been given the job permanently , officials announced Monday . The move ends the search for a successor to W. Glenn Campbell , the outspoken conservative who headed Hoover for 29 years . Raisian , 40 , has a Ph.D. in economics from UCLA and taught at the University of Washington and the University of Houston . He held several posts in the Ronald Reagan Administration , including director of research and technical support in the U.S. Department of Labor . He later headed a consulting firm in Los Angeles and went to Hoover in 1986 as a senior research fellow , eventually rising to second in command under Campbell . Symbolic of Hoover 's unusual ties with Stanford , Raisian 's appointment was announced jointly by Stanford President Donald Kennedy and Robert H. Malott , chairman of the Hoover Board of Overseers . Though Hoover is within the purview of the university , it operates independently , a setup that critics contend allows the think tank to be controlled by conservative donors . Kennedy said Monday that he hoped Raisian 's appointment , effective immediately , will improve `` the relationship between Hoover and the rest of Stanford University . '' Campbell fought with Kennedy over the terms and timing of his retirement and argued with liberal critics . Campbell remains at Hoover as an adviser . Several sources at Stanford said the first choice to succeed Campbell was Michael Boskin , the Stanford economics professor who is chairman of President Bush 's Council of Economic Advisers . But Boskin is said to want to stay in his Washington job . Although Campbell praised Raisian 's appointment , John F. Manley , a Stanford political science professor and critic of Hoover , said : `` A new director does n't change the old problem . . . . Hoover continues to be an independent think thank pushing right-wing causes . ''
