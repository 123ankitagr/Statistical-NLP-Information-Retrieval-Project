We 're off to see the wizard , the wonderful wizard of Oz . Only NBC 's yellow brick road leads to the wizard of ooze . Its story about the author of the children 's book that inspired that 1939 movie classic , `` The Wizard of Oz , '' is long on mush and short on magic . Airing at 9 tonight on Channels 4 , 36 and 39 , `` The Dreamer of Oz : The L. Frank Baum Story '' finds John Ritter playing Baum as a one-dimensional bo-bo of such unfaltering goodness that he makes Mr. Rogers look like the Marquis de Sade . Following one business failure after another , Baum ultimately converts his fanciful dreams and yarns into a best-selling children 's book , `` The Wonderful Wizard of Oz . '' Other successful books follow . Written by Richard Matheson and directed by Jack Bender , `` The Dreamer of Oz '' is at once a 19th-Century maudlin love story ( with Annette O'Toole as Baum 's loyal wife , Maud ) and an unfulfilled kid 's story . With Ritter giving mostly a single-note performance , Baum comes alive only through his own imagination , as the stories he tells to enthralled children are translated on screen into charming fantasy . Here is where we meet Dorothy , the brainless scarecrow , the heartless tin man , the cowardly lion and other characters in his best-known book , including the Wiz himself , all of them inspired by people Baum knows . Although these blazingly colorful sequences are mostly delightful fun and imaginatively mounted , they 're too infrequent to dent an otherwise stolid melodrama whose only spunky character is Baum 's critical mother-in-law ( Rue McClanahan ) . The message -- that dreams are the best part of us -- is very nice . Otherwise , this is woolly wizardry at best . HOWARD ROSENBERG
