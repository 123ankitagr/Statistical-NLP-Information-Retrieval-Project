A plan to plug a loophole in West Hollywood 's tough rent control law has moved ahead . Under the plan unanimously approved by the City Council , landlords whose properties are exempt from rent control would have to provide relocation benefits to tenants forced to move by sharp rent increases . The council held off enacting an ordinance to allow city staff time to recommend how large such rent increases should be before triggering the relocation benefits . Mayor Abbe Land said she introduced the measure after renters in a building complained of receiving notices that their rents were to be more than doubled , some from $ 1,100 to as much as $ 2,500 . The owner wants to convert the apartments into condominiums . Because the building at 944 Palm Ave. was in rental service prior to 1979 , it is exempt from most provisions of West Hollywood 's 1985 rent control law . However , owners of exempt buildings still must pay relocation fees for tenants if the property is removed from the rental market .
