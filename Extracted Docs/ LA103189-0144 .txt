Georgia-Pacific Corp. , one of the largest lumber companies , today launched a $ 3.2-billion bid for papermaker Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. in a merger that would create the world 's largest forest products company . Great Northern stock surged $ 18.75 to $ 61.50 in heavy early trading on the New York Stock Exchange , hurtling past the $ 58 that George-Pacific offered for each share . But Atlanta-based Georgia-Pacific 's stock dropped $ 2.25 to $ 51.125 as traders bet that it could be headed for a costly acquisition fight . Great Northern , headquartered in Norwalk , Conn. , said the bid was uninvited , but Georgia-Pacific appeared determined to push forward with the offer and perhaps sweeten it . The combined forest products company would top other leading forest products companies such as International Paper Co. and Weyerhaeuser Co. in sales , with a combined total of nearly $ 14 billion .
