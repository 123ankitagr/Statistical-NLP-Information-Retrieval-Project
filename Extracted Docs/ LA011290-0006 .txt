An open letter to Jesse Jackson : The world has changed since we both walked behind Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a quarter-century ago . Still , we share that shining memory and , I suppose , a common allegiance to our country and its people . Beyond that , we differ on many issues . Sadly , I have to say I find your column on Panama not only mean-spirited but riddled with error . Let me point out the most egregious . Do you really think that `` democracy is not created at the point of a bayonet '' ? What did Washington 's brave , beleaguered army carry on their bayonets in 1776 , then ? What did the GIs splashing ashore in Normandy and across France into Germany bring , if not democracy ? What brought democracy to Japan , if not bayonets ? What but bayonets brought down Ceausescu , and may yet bring democracy to Romania ? You deplore bayonets in Panama ? Perhaps you preferred Noriega ? Not only do the Panamanian people appear to disagree with you , but the General Assembly of the United Nations , for the first time in years , failed to muster a majority condemning the United States in a vote on this issue . Think about it . CHARLTON HESTON Beverly Hills
