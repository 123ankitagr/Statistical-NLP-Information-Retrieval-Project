A Superior Court judge said Tuesday that both sides in the Ramon Salcido mass murder case have tentatively agreed on moving his trial to Contra Costa , San Joaquin or San Mateo counties . Salcido is charged with the murders last April of his wife , Angela , 24 ; daughters , Sofia , 4 , and Teresa , 1 ; his mother-in-law , Marion Richards , 47 ; Richards ' daughters , Ruth , 12 , and Marie , 8 ; and his boss , Tracy Toovey , 35 . He also is charged with attempting to kill another daughter , Carmina , 3 , and fellow winery worker Ken Butti , 33 . Public Defender Marteen Miller has successfully argued that intense publicity surrounding the case would make it impossible for Salcido , 38 , to get a fair trial in Sonoma County .
