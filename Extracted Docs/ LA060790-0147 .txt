Things looked very familiar at the start for Stanford freshman Brian Sackinsky against Georgia on Wednesday night . But the ending could n't have been any different or better for him . A surprise starter for injured All-American Stan Spencer , Sackinsky , a 6-foot-4 right-hander from South Park High in Library , Pa. , overcame a shaky start to pitch his first complete game , a 4-2 victory over the Bulldogs that kept the top-seeded Cardinal alive in the College World Series . The victory means Stanford will face Georgia ( 50-19 ) again Friday in the double-elimination tournament . Georgia handed Stanford its only loss , 16-2 . The winner advances to Saturday 's championship game against either Oklahoma State or Louisiana State . Sackinsky ( 10-1 ) was hit hard in Sunday 's loss to the Bulldogs . He lasted only one-third of an inning in relief , yielding four hits and five runs . This time , Georgia scored two runs in the first on two hits , but that was all Sackinsky gave them as he finished with a six-hitter and a career-high 10 strikeouts . Jeff Hammonds put the Cardinal ( 59-11 ) ahead for good in the seventh with a two-run single .
