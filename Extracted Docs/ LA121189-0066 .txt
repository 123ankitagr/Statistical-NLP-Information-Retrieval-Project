Washington Buys Building : Dancer-choreographer Lula Washington has purchased the mid-city building that has housed her studio and company , L.A . Contemporary Dance Theatre , for the past seven years . Faced with the reality of no financial cushion to even begin to meet the purchase price of $ 225,000 asked by owner-actor Taurean Blacque , Washington and her board of directors raised the $ 158,000 down payment in six months with no help from traditional lending institutions . Washington mortgaged her family home , and in a grass roots effort sought grants , loans and donations of varying sizes from a variety of community organizations , agencies and individuals . The balance is due by the end of 1990 , and $ 150,000 more is required for earthquake upgrade , so fund-raising continues . Washington is planning a January open house and celebration . The building , located on Adams Boulevard , is a former Masonic Temple . Claudia Puig
