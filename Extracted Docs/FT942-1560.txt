COFFEE futures fell sharply at the London Commodity Exchange yesterday afternoon , emulating a drop in New York . The September delivery position finished Dollars 66 lower at Dollars 2,278 a tonne , slightly off the lows , mainly on profit-taking , with little news to drive the market one way or the other . ' I do n't think anyone has a genuine idea of where the price is going , ' one trader commented . The LCE COCOA market , which was also influenced by the trend in New York , had a lacklustre day , nudging below the opening lows and finishing Pounds 15 down at Pounds 1,000 a tonne , its low of the day , in the September position . A trader said the producer selling seemed to be largely 'on hold ' , with much of the activity dominated by speculators following general commodity market trends . At the London Bullion Market GOLD finished unchanged after fixing at a 5 1/2 month high in the morning in response to New York 's overnight rise . But the US market weakened yesterday as the dollar put in a stronger performance . Dealers said gold was still tied to currency markets but had shaken off its allegiance to moves in the Commodity Research Bureau index . Compiled from Reuters
