it was with sadness and more than a bit of anger that i read dan sullivans nov 19 article on the supposed lack of classical american actors into the breach with branagh as an actor who has done most of her work in the classics and has been fortunate enough to work with worldclass american actors and directors on the classics i was appalled by sullivans uniformed and chauvinistically anglophile observations first to say that taper executive gordon davidsons decision to bring over a british company to do shakespeare is gutsy is both offensive and ridiculous what would be gutsy would be to use classical american actors who are well versed in the language plays not just personality actors whose last brush with shakespeare may have been their high school english class i recognize the need for boxoffice draw but i believe the american public would respond as well to quality as to tvq come mr sullivan in this day of foreign interests buying up our country right and left dont sell out our actors too hope alexanderwillis los angelessex and iq
