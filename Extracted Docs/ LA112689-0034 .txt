It was with sadness and more than a bit of anger that I read Dan Sullivan 's Nov. 19 article on the supposed lack of classical American actors ( `` Into the Breach With Branagh '' ) . As an actor who has done most of her work in the classics and has been fortunate enough to work with world-class American actors and directors on the classics , I was appalled by Sullivan 's uniformed and chauvinistically anglophile observations . First , to say that Taper executive Gordon Davidson 's decision to bring over a British company to do Shakespeare is `` gutsy '' is both offensive and ridiculous . What would be gutsy would be to use classical American actors who are well versed in the language plays , not just personality actors whose last brush with Shakespeare may have been their high school English class . ( I recognize the need for box-office draw , but I believe the American public would respond as well to quality as to TV-Q . ) Come , Mr. Sullivan , in this day of foreign interests buying up our country right and left , do n't sell out our actors too !
