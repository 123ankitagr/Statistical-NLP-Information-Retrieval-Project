it was with sadness and more than a bit of anger that i read dan sullivan's nov 19 article on the supposed lack of classical american actors into the breach with branagh as an actor who has done most of her work in the classics and has been fortunate enough to work with world-class american actors and directors on the classics i was appalled by sullivan's uniformed and chauvinistically anglophile observations first to say that taper executive gordon davidson's decision to bring over a british company to do shakespeare is gutsy is both offensive and ridiculous what would be gutsy would be to use classical american actors who are well versed in the language plays not just personality actors whose last brush with shakespeare may have been their high school english class i recognize the need for box-office draw but i believe the american public would respond as well to quality as to tv-q come mr sullivan in this day of foreign interests buying up our country right and left don't sell out our actors too hope alexander-willis los angelessex and iq
