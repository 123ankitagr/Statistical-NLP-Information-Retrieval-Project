What a guy , that Marvin Hier ! He fights anti-Semitism , finds aging Nazis and remembers the Holocaust . Why , he even educates people about the Armenian genocide . But his new tourist attraction should not be named the Museum of Tolerance . Some years ago his center gave an award to U.S . Ambassador to the United Nations Jeanne Kirkpatrick for her support of Israel , the same Jeanne Kirkpatrick who has supported every pseudodemocratic ( read : fascist ) government in Central America . If it was not nice to murder Jews in the past , it is also not nice for the U.S. government to sponsor dictators who murder our Central American neighbors . Hier 's center is no longer deluged by my $ 10 donations . Ann Bourman Los Angeles
