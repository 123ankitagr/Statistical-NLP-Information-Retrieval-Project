A U.S.-born rancher indicted in Costa Rica for arms and drug trafficking in connection with the Iran-Contra affair has vanished , officials said . A spokesman for the Public Security Ministry said Costa Rican authorities have n't seen John Hull since last Thursday . `` I suspect that Mr . Hull has been kidnaped , '' said Juan Jose Sobrado , Hull 's lawyer . Hull , 68 , from Evansville , Ind. , has lived in Costa Rica for the past 20 years and became a naturalized citizen seven years ago . Last week , a Costa Rican commission recommended that Hull be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the country . According to the commission , planes smuggling arms to the Contras landed secretly at Hull 's ranch in 1984 and 1985 . Drug trafficking also was alleged .
