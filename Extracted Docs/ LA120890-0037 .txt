The economic climate in Texas must be more desperate than we have been led to believe . Last Saturday , I watched a televised football game between the wealthy University of Texas and another university obviously needing financial help . I believe the less-fortunate school is sponsored by the Texas banking industry as they advertised Automatic Teller Machines , ATM , on their helmets . How did this financial package develop , and does the NCAA condone this crass commercial practice ? FRANK R. SESTANOVICH Woodland Hills
