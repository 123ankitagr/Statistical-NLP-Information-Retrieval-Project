the possibility that mr kim jong-il son of the late president kim il-sung will be named north korean president and head of the ruling party next week after the 100-day mourning for his father may remove uncertainty over the extent of the new leader's control in pyongyang statements by north korean officials referring to mr kim as the supreme leader led diplomats to believe a turning point may soon be reached in nuclear talks between the us and north korea which resumed at high level in geneva on wednesday after a five-day break with no one in confident overall command it is most unlikely north korean officials would take responsibility for reaching agreement said a western diplomat to have a properly appointed leader must be a step forward diplomats expressed caution over mr kim's influence on the talks saying it was impossible to predict whether he would take the same hard line as his father or a more conciliatory one negotiations centre on an international aid package to switch north korea's nuclear programme from graphite-moderated reactors to safer light-water versions in a preliminary accord reached on august 12, pyongyang agreed to freeze its nuclear programme in return for light-water technology and diplomatic ties with washington but in talks since then north korean officials have put up a series of new demands which washington calls unacceptable the talks have been consistently described as serious and businesslike by both sides but many observers fear north korea is simply seeking to gain time to pursue its nuclear ambitions and stave off economic sanctions reports from washington say the clinton administration has decided not to give ground to pyongyang but to maintain its august offer and hope this will eventually be accepted with american forces engaged in haiti and mid-term elections next month the us has no interest in precipitating a confrontation although north korea denies a nuclear weapons programme it continues to refuse access to two suspected nuclear waste sites at the yongbyon nuclear complex the international atomic energy agency believes inspection of these sites could provide clues to what has happened to plutonium missing from an experimental 5 mw nuclear reactor in last week's geneva talks mr kang sok-ju north korea's first deputy foreign minister apparently rejected even a rough timetable for such inspections which the us insists must be part of any final deal other unresolved issues concern the roughly 8,000 spent reactor-fuel rods in a holding pond at yongbyon which the us wants shipped out of the country and north korea's demands for cash compensation for ending its graphite-moderated reactor programme
