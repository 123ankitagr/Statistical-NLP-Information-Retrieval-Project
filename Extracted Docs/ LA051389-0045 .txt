Formation of an `` intervention team '' of actuaries and financial experts to represent consumer interests in hearings by the state Insurance Department into rate rollback exemptions was announced Friday by Harvey Rosenfield , Proposition 103 chairman , and Conway Collis , a prospective candidate for state insurance commissioner in 1990 . Sutter Creek insurance consultant Mark Gerlach , a former rate analyst for the state Insurance Department , was named to serve as the paid executive director of the group , which will analyze and comment on insurance industry documents submitted to support exemptions from the 20 % rate rollbacks from 1987 levels called for under Proposition 103 . The group applied Friday with Insurance Commissioner Roxani Gillespie for intervenor status in the forthcoming hearings . Under one provision of Proposition 103 , Gillespie may order the insurance companies to reimburse such intervenors if she finds that they substantially contributed to eventual rate decisions . `` We feel it 's essential that consumers have their own representation in these proceedings , '' said Collis , a member of the state Board of Equalization who has Rosenfield 's support in his developing campaign for insurance commissioner . Rosenfield said he also welcomes the participation of other consumer groups , such as Consumers Union and the Insurance Consumer Action Network , as intervenors in the hearings , although he noted that earlier in the week their leaders had said they lacked the resources to fully participate unless they were to get advance funding from insurers . Rosenfield said his initiative does not permit such advance funding . Also named as experts assisting the Rosenfield-Collis group were San Diego actuary Clarence Atwood and Beverly Hills public accountant H. Les Kornblatt .
