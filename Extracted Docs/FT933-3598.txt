' I could write a book ' runs the old Rodgers & Hart tune . If former IMRO chairman George Nissen should choose to do so he wo n't have far to look for a publisher - he 's just bought one . Nissen , who fell on his sword in June 1992 in the wake of the Maxwell scandal , has acquired The Book Guild , one of the UK 's subscription publishers . Unkind fellow publishers not in the subscription game sometimes refer to it as 'vanity ' publishing ; the author pays the publisher to bring out the book . Not all authors write with the single aim of making a profit , says Nissen , whose company brings out up to 100 titles annually , with print runs as low as 500 copies . Now if he could be persuaded to sit down and pen his own recent experiences , demand might be a little greater than that .
