when general electric of the us admitted recently that computer hackers had gained access to sensitive company material via the internet it raised fears among businesses about the confidentiality of their dealings on the rapidly-expanding worldwide computer network many people believe the internet offers them all the security of a royal telephone call says gerry o'neill of britain's national computing centre in manchester speaking ironically he estimates that around 60 per cent of all traffic on the internet is of commercial origin based on message exchanges using the co suffix which identifies business users security practices which are required for an internal network with a few thousand users simply do not guarantee secure links to an internet community of 35 m people he says the responsibility rests with companies to establish their security properly but there are indications that some of the 25,000 or so companies worldwide thought to be using the internet commercially may not be taking security as seriously as the risks warrant or that they do not regard their data as particularly sensitive a survey in the us last month by ernst young and information week magazine quizzed more than 1,250 various-sized companies more than half admitted suffering some kind of loss due to computer security problems but 34 per cent of respondents said their senior management saw information security as only somewhat important and 8 per cent around 100 companies said the issue was viewed as not important at all dr brian neale a uk-based specialist on internet security with us computer company digital equipment points out that once a system's security has been breached its advantages are lost to legitimate users until the problem is solved even if the loss is only for a few hours the cost can be high ge's system was off the net for about a week the scramble among businesses not to be left behind by the internet revolution has meant that the normally high security standards found among large it users are not mirrored in their policies towards the internet dr neale says he estimates that three-quarters of large firms currently using or intending to use the internet fall into this category and are under-protected making them dangerous drivers on the information superhighway in a study called secure connections to the internet neale outlines the need for effective security procedures known as firewalls in effect these are gateway computers which distinguish authorised access from unauthorised the aim of the digital firewall is to allow employees to gain access to internet services in as near-transparent fashion as possible while preventing access of unauthorised external users he says britain's department of trade and industry has a permanent team working on policy for it security with several leading companies including bt unilever midland bank and nationwide building society the team has produced a code of practice advising information security managers how to establish and develop a secure information strategy but a big part of the security problem as it specifically relates to the internet is that there is no visible regulator or any overall authority that formally polices those who use the system fundamental legal requirements are laid down by the 1984 data protection act one of the principles of which states that appropriate security measures shall be taken against unauthorised access to or alteration disclosure or destruction of personal data and against accidental loss or destruction of personal data while the 1990 computer misuse act does not impose any statutory requirements on businesses its aim is to deter unauthorised access to and modification of information held on computers it created three offences acting with intent to gain unauthorised access to programs or data held on computer unauthorised access with intent to commit or facilitate commission of more serious offences and unauthorised modification of the contents of a computer the dti believes companies should promote awareness of these offences as part of their computer security policies in addition to taking steps to reduce the risk of offences being perpetrated on their computer systems as became clear from the ge breach even the existence of sophisticated firewalls does not deter dedicated hackers what is obvious however is that as the nature of on-line commerce evolves companies will be forced to reassess their computer security provisions almost continually dr brian neale who is author of the report secure connections to the internet can be contacted at brian neale sbp mts dec com or through the digital company liaison shani morris reo mts dec com
