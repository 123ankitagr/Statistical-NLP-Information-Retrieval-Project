The Wildlife Protection Initiative would indeed prohibit trophy hunting of the California mountain lion , but would not restrict hunting of any other species . In fact , the initiative would protect extensive areas of habitat for a wide variety of wildlife , specifically including deer . The dramatic decline in the numbers of deer in California is largely a reflection of habitat loss . This decline can only be stopped if enough deer habitat is acquired to protect remaining deer ( and mountain lion ) populations . The hunting community should support the initiative , since it offers the only real hope that deer habitat will be preserved for generations to come in both Northern and Southern California . Anglers should also support the initiative , since fishing streams throughout the state would also be improved . GERALD H. MERAL Campaign Manager California Wildlife Protection Committee Sacramento
