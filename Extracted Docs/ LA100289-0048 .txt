the wildlife protection initiative would indeed prohibit trophy hunting of the california mountain lion but would not restrict hunting of any other species in fact the initiative would protect extensive areas of habitat for a wide variety of wildlife specifically including deer the dramatic decline in the numbers of deer in california is largely a reflection of habitat loss this decline can only be stopped if enough deer habitat is acquired to protect remaining deer and mountain lion populations the hunting community should support the initiative since it offers the only real hope that deer habitat will be preserved for generations to come in both northern and southern california anglers should also support the initiative since fishing streams throughout the state would also be improved gerald h meral campaign manager california wildlife protection committee sacramento
