cbs may have ended last season in third place but its surprise hit the western miniseries lonesome dove notsosurprisingly netted the most nominations thursday for the 41st annual nighttime emmy awards topping by one the most nominated show of the last two seasons la law lonesome dove the critically acclaimed eighthour adaptation of larry mcmurtrys pulitzer prizewinning novel garnered 18 nominations including one as best miniseries and others for stars tommy lee jones robert duvall diane lane and anjelica huston its showing pushed cbs to a strong second place among the nomination leaders ratings king nbc which has dominated the emmy nominations for the last six years collected 103 of the 364 nominations with cbs getting 95 and abc 85 pbs programs netted 32 and syndicated programs got 21 nominations fox broadcasting shows got 12 cable programs which became eligible for nomination for the first time last year received 16 nominations only one more than last year suzanne de passe coexecutive producer of lonesome dove and president of motown productions said thursday that when she got the 6 am call from the academy of television arts sciences informing her of the 18 nominations i immediately burst into tears its probably the most satisfying moment i think ive ever had she said im so thrilled not just for the actors and what they call the major categories but for our costumer all of the people who really gave it all of that look the photography the music for me as a producer and as part of the producing team it really means we selected great people de passe added that the multiple nominations will not affect motowns decision on whether to produce a sequel to what was the highest rated miniseries of the last five years that depends she said on whether author mcmurtry endorses it its the only way i would be happy doing a sequel she said last years best series winners abcs thirtysomething in drama and abcs the wonder years in comedy were nominated in those categories again and also picked up more total nominations than in their first year on the air thirtysomething got 13 compared to its 1988 total of 10 while the wonder years which received only two nominations in 1988 in the series and writing categories garnered 14 this time out cbs newcomer murphy brown starring candice bergen as a harddriving tv newswoman became the mostnominated new series of last season with 11 nominations but the series faces stiff competition in the best comedy category other nominees include previous emmywinners the wonder years nbcs golden girls and nbcs cheers along with cbs designing women were thrilled were just thrilled said diane english coexecutive producer of murphy brown with husband joel shukovsky a part of me would like to be the kind of person who says it means nothing i dont care but lets be honest this is pretty great especially since were such a new show english acknowledged that the thrill of being nominated is tempered by the waiting period between now and the emmy awards ceremony which will be held sept 17 at the pasadena civic auditorium now is the part when its not so much fun where people try to involve you in that competition and it really shouldnt be that she said it would be great if it didnt come down to one winner because the stuff that gets nominated is all so good it would be great if it just ended here that these are the five best shows in each category murphy brown has been only a marginal ratings success for cbs but ratings dont necessarily translate into emmy nominations the three toprated series of last season received only six nominations among them four for abcs roseanne and one each for nbcs thursdaynight tandem of the cosby show and a diffent world and none was nominated as best comedy series the star of roseanne former standup comedian roseanne barr also failed to win nomination as best actress in a comedy series although john goodman who plays her husband was nominated as best actor also notably absent among the comedy nominees was john larroquette of night court who has won the emmy as best supporting actor for four years in a row but while barr was an entrant in the competition larroquette was not the actor took advantage of a new emmy rule that requires actors to enter themselves in the competition as do producers writers and entrants in all other categories in previous years the producers of the shows were allowed to enter their cast members in the acting categories larroquette said thursday that he chose not to enter i think my thought process was that the generosity of the academy toward me has been magnanimous and i just felt that i didnt want to overstay my welcome he said i dont think there was any real devious thought about it such as ive never lost and i dont want to lose now along with the murphy brown nomination as best comedy cbs scored another coup in the best drama category with its secondseason series wiseguy the story of undercover agent vinnie terranova ken wahl other best drama nominees were abcs china beach cbs beauty and the beast nbcs la law and abcs thirtysomething wahl also found a place among the nominated lead actors in a drama series along with ron perlman of beauty and the beast edward woodward of the equalizer carroll oconnor of in the heat of the night and michael tucker of la law lead actresses nominated in the drama category were linda hamilton of beauty and the beast dana delany of china beach susan dey and jill eikenberry of la law and angela lansbury of murder she wrote several special programs and
