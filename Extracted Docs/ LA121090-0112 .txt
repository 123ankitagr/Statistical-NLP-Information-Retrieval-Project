joe sample makes medium art the pianist who offered his amalgam of jazz pop rb and latin influences saturday at the celebrity theatre is like fellow keyboardist ramsey lewis he plays unpretentiously with sincerity and with more than a modicum of flair dynamics and creativity yet he never reaches for the skies of high art where compositions and improvisations can cause a listener to leave a venue a changed person sample seeks to entertain not enlighten hes a musician for the masses which is not to say hes mediocre far from it and doesnt mean he doesnt come across with the goods he does at the celebrity the 51yearold pianist whos known both for his work with the jazzfunking crusaders of which he was a founding member and his solo albums like rainbow seeker and spellbound put his mark on what he played his distinctive touch nice bluesy feel and considerable warmth were always in evidence as renditions of tunes such as a desert in monterey bones jive ashes to ashes georgia on my mind the only nonoriginal performed and sermonized readily proved still the saltandpeppergoateed sample is not a risk taker and he didnt stretch his boundaries a lot his tunes with their catchy earfriendly melodies backbeat rhythmic orientation and relatively noncomplex harmonic constructions were after a while a little difficult to distinguish from one another and in effect offered limited platforms for soloing its as if a painter were working in only four shades of orange or blue or brown given the commonality of your material its hard to find new ways to tell your story yet within his chosen frameworks sample did just that told modest tales and created a series of authentic honest moods with excellent backup support from neil larsen keyboards john pena electric bass land richards drums and lennie castro latin percussion the leader leaning into his instrument as he worked explored his tunes with scalar runs funky turns dancing chordal ascents highend tinkles and low rumbling chords keeping the feeling if not the melody of his chosen theme in the forefront the closetotwohour show had its share of highlights sermonized which was reminiscent of the evocative funk that made the crusaders so popular moved from a quiet somber mood that spoke of both sadness and beauty to a spirited uplifting setting replete with banged chords and a gospelish tinge and back then pena issued walking bass lines instead of his usual punchy brief thoughts richards switched to a bop time feel and larsen his synthesizer sounding like a steam calliope soloed going with everything from frantic scurries to highpitched squeals the tune closed as it began bones jive which cooked from start to stop was a charged item where the leader dug in deep and wailed with the band right there on his tail especially castro who issued whaps on his bongos then his congas to further drive the leader particularly moving were ashes to ashes the title track of samples latest warner bros album and the unaccompanied and soulful version of georgia where his mixture of blues statements and flowing chordal ideas enhanced his treatment at the close of carmel which concluded the show sample received a standing ovation he then played two encores his second was rainbow seeker perhaps his most popular piece sample who appears thursday at the ventura theatre friday at the raymond theatre in pasadena and sunday at the hop in riverside needs to open up his horizons and challenge himself a bit more his music good now would only get better
