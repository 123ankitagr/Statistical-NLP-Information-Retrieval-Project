For all those critics of the late Malcolm Forbes ' birthday bash of last year : He celebrated his life on his last birthday in the grand fashion that he wanted . Who said that he was going to deduct his expenses anyway ? He 'd only have been following the legal guidelines set by our Congress . Forbes at least got twice the monetary value from the publicity throughout the world for his celebration . Forbes will be sorely missed by those who realize that he did what everyone with or without a lot of money wishes he could do . He did what he loved . Do n't let anyone speak against those who know that life is for living and not just working . CHRIS CONSIDINE Altadena
