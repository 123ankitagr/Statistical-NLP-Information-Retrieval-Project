question is there much difference in the amount of calories and fat to be found in different kinds of fish my family enjoys red snapper and swordfish for example and i could prepare either one would the calories and fat make any difference answer a 3ounce broiled serving of red snapper provides 104 calories and 12 grams of fat a similar portion of swordfish provides 128 calories and 43 grams of fat
