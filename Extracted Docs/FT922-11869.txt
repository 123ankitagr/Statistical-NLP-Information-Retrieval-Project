THE Chicago Board of Trade , the world 's largest futures exchange , has signed a letter of intent to co-operate with Knight Ridder Financial to develop an international commodity index future . The index will be calculated and disseminated by the Commodity Research Bureau ( CRB ) , a subsidiary of Knight-Ridder Financial . It will be production-weighted and consist of 18 commodity futures . Mr William O'Connor , CBOT chairman , said the exchange believed that the contract will appeal to institutional investors and commodity trading advisers around the world . A CRB index future currently trades on the New York Futures Exchange , but it is weighted differently .
