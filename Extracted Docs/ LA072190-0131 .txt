as debuts go the concert thursday evening was certainly little noted accountants conventions open with greater fanfare than greeted the shostakovich quartet one could easily imagine that moscows finest had hitchhiked into town instead of arriving on their first us tour sponsored by the prestigious santa fe chamber music festival but it will certainly be long remembered by the happy few in attendence at schoenberg hall ucla the rest of you get another chance tonight when the ensemble plays a second program the shostakovich quartet has a suave versatile sound all its own generally dark and softgrained it is capable of gruff muttering and heroic outbursts of affecting song and taut discourse all delivered with complete unanimity wellblended and balanced but utterly transparent in texture violinists andrei shishlov and sergei pishchugin violist alexander galkovsky and cellist alexander korchagin brought with them big unhackneyed programs of russian music most refreshing and stimulating in a season dominated by light andor familiar repertory the centerpiece thursday was the quartet no 4 opus 49 by vasili lobanov a moscow colleague it proved a discursive but formally rounded epic tense and angry but also revealing flashes of ironic wit lobanovs style is undogmatically expressive rooted in shostakovich and bartok for all the emotional vehemence and coloristic bravura of the piece his quartet is built on a single stepwise gesture sometimes shrunk through microtonal inflections sometimes displaced over octaves chordally amplified or linked in melodic chains but an obsessive concentrating presence the ensemble played the draining work with unflagging energy and stern often savage authority they take risks but proved understandably wellversed in the manifold challenges some of the ancestry of the lobanov work could be heard in the rarely performed remarkably forwardlooking quartet no 1 by borodin the scherzo with its slashing vigor and stunning trio in harmonics and the andante with its subtle modal variations and glorious partwriting connected strongly with the rest of the agenda the shostakovans began with their namesakes fourth quartet in a flowing reading that started in sonorous lyricism and grew into an intense debate the deeply serious slightly abstracted performance explored layers of subtexts while maintaining a placidly austere surface there was nothing austere about the encore however the now beaming musicians returned with shostakovichs age of gold polka in a gleefully hammy sardonically explosive account john henken
