How disgusting it was to read of what those gun enthusiasts were doing to that poor 5-year-old girl . I could n't believe how insensitive they were to the trauma that girl experienced over the shooting of her mother . If those gun users want to do that girl a favor , they should make a bonfire of their instruments of mayhem , and tell her how sorry they were that guns were ever invented . At least they should be made to read your front-page story in the same edition on how frequent violence is having a traumatic impact on many Los Angeles County children ( `` When Learning to Walk Means Learning to Duck '' ) .
