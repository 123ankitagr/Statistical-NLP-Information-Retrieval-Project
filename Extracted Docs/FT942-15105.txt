the beggargirl was enchantingly beautiful she must have been at least six years old give me shampoo she pleaded seemingly close to tears give me lipstick give me soaps and she tugged again at our camerastraps i reflected that the beggars of madurai had become more sophisticated since i was last there the younger generation was targetting the tourists in fourstarhotel language perhaps because it had discovered that foreigners are now implored by everybody by guidebooks and travel agents and aid workers not to listen to the pleas of indias beggar hordes give a cheque to the charities they all say that is the most efficient way you can help but the beggars are usually not beautiful there was an old man hobbling behind the girl who wanted to show me something revolting on the end of the stump of his arm he didnt want shampoo he was determined on rupees we struggled on through the crowd and surrendered our shoes to another old man this time for safe keeping while we entered the hindu temple and we were secretly relieved when our guide dispersed the crowd for a few seconds with a flurry of gestures and curses this is one of the phenomena one of the eternal truths of india which alarms the firsttime visitor how will we cope with the poverty is it true that there are babies dying on the pavements what are we supposed to do when we are surrounded by a score of frantic pleading ragged and horribly deformed children the question the problem can present itself at a higher and moral level here am i spending a comparative fortune on my own pleasure enjoying the luxury of sophisticated hotels in order to seek out the glories of a supreme civilisation while out there on the street i glimpse them from my airconditioned taxi my fellowbeings are suffering a misery which is incomprehensible to let alone endurable by a european it is a topic which invariably comes up in dinnerparty talk there is no shortage of people not just those of excessive sensitivity whose holiday has been ruined by the sights they have seen on their very first drive from bombay airport to the luxuriance of the taj hotel because india of all the countries and cultures and civilisations of this world most deserves the effort i have a suggestion start off in goa it is india made easy goa unlike india proper is green wellfed clean up to a point accessible christian cosmopolitan it also has an englishspeaking efficient and fastexpanding tourist industry it is picturesque it has wonderful beaches a splendid and unoppressive climate and it is still pretty cheap the local cuisine is delicious and distinctive it even makes its own wine yes well no wonder it is in the vanguard of the indian governments tourist plans goa has not always been a favoured british destination because it was portuguese from the early 16th century until the peaceloving nehru sent in his army in 1961 it did not figure in the favoured itineraries of the raj like kashmir the taj mahal rajasthan and the elephanta caves all that has changed and goa is certain to continue its charterdriven boom of visitors from europe particularly from britain most of the tourists come for the beaches which to repeat are wonderful and not spoiled at all by hippy colonies much exaggerated or neverending offers from the locals of massage or handicrafts or coconuts these locals are not touts in the mediterranean sense irritating and intrusive i have one happy memory of an enormously fat and goodtempered australian under the parasol next to mine being persuaded by a group of passing youths to pose with them for a photograph because they told him their village would not otherwise believe that anyone of his size could exist they then gave him a bunch of flowers the sea and the sand and the climate of goa are of the best but goa is worth journeying above the hightide mark the portuguese colonial presence produced an attractive local architectural style as well as a christian tradition these come together most dramatically in the semideserted town of old goa inland through the rice paddies from the present capital of panaji it is an essential excursion even for beach fanatics old goa boasts under the dedicated though povertystricken guardianship of the architectural survey of india a collection of remarkable episcopal and civic buildings that dates from the 16th century in the mid19th century the portuguese rulers retreated from old goas diseases and moved downstream to panaji today old goas hottest draw is the mummified and miraculously preserved body of st francis xavier the jesuit who arrived in 1542 went on to continue his mission work in china and asked to be returned in death to his beloved goa he rests there today his unravaged face visible through a glass plate in the basilica bom jesus by ancient tradition his body is taken into the cathedral on rare occasions when the devout hindus as well as roman catholics pilgrims from around the world as well as locals gather in their millions to venerate him this exposition is to happen again this year apparently for the final time because the corpse at long last is shrinking at an embarrassing rate it is going to be an enormous affair and if you are not one of the abovementioned devout you would be welladvised to steer clear do not assume that you find only an untypical christian culture in this part of india although portuguese rule obliged the hindus to build their temples inland and on a modest scale you can get a fascinating introduction to that religion on a scale less overwhelming and intimidating than in the enormous temple complexes in the south this explosion of tourism must be particularly welcome to the goans an outwardlooking people who have traditionally emigrated all over the world because they have to face up to the decline of their local iron ore exports but the boom carries with it all the usual dangers so well demonstrated elsewhere in the worlds beautiful places pollution falling standards ribbon development crime environmental destruction and so on the encouraging news is that goa seems to be enforcing planning controls more rigorously than elsewhere in india with the prime aim of protecting the beaches this has to be noted as well as applauded by the tourist for example when leafing through the travel trades brochures you need to know that for some years hoteliers have been required to build several hundred metres behind the sealine this splendid rule means that many of goas hotels are set back from and out of sight of the ocean which is not always clear from the travel agents purple prose watch out for those giveaway phrases like only five minutes walk from the sand my recommendation is that you consider splashing out on one of the older and more expensive hotels which does have a seashore position while consoling yourself with the thought that airfares have become ridiculously cheap for instance any good travel agent or bucketshop will get you on to a charter flight direct to goa saving the hassle of transitting through bombay or delhi and the subsequent scrimmage on indian airlines you then throw away any vouchers for a guesthouse on a coconut plantation and set off at once to a room at say the fort aguada i promise that the fort aguada beach resort owned by the taj group is very good indeed and i judged it by the highest international standards it stands above the sea at one end of the wonderful sweep of calangute beach after it was built in 1974 it was unfairly described by the distinguished british architecture critic j m richards as a sadly insensitive group of buildings in hollywoodoriental style today the complex has weathered well and takes an unobtrusive place in dense tropical foliage against the headland perhaps in response to richards abuse the taj management has now built next door and sharing facilities a taj village in a strictly goan style of lowlevel cottages surrounded by coconut palms thirdly and thanks to the indian governments hosting of the commonwealth conference in 1983 there is also the hermitage an estate of selfcontained luxury villas up on the hill very much intended for the ft reader who wants to escape the crowd and can afford to you need to book in advance for lady thatchers bedroom by indian standards the fort aguada complex is expensive but it works and it may be worth it after acclimatising in goa the firsttime indiahand will be ready to venture out into the real world the best course is to take one of the regular and longestablished itineraries on offer these are the delhiagrajaipur triangle the rajasthan palaces the north nepal etc and these days ladakh the hindu south the choice will be influenced by season as well as by local political factors for example kashmir is a nogo area at present similarly there are problems with some of the himalayan venues and a specialist travel agent will have to advise the climate is an obvious decider you wont want to go to goa even between may and september while the north is less attractive after say october none of these things is rigid the monsoon does not arrive on the dot one good possibility to mention just one example would be to venture out from goa on the sort of south indian tour which is available from various companies private travel is probably best attempted by secondtimers or the young the frequent starting point is madras on the east coast which leads inevitably to the major temples at madurai where there is a newlyconverted and delightful rajstyle taj group hotel on a hill outside that seething hindu town you then set out over the mountains of pepper and coffee and tea plantations via the lakeside game reserve of periyar where you might see elephant to finish up weary and triumphant after a boneshattering drive from coast to coast at cochin thereafter it is either back to goa or bombay or down to sri lanka for a few days where the tourist industry has been hardhit by troubles in the northeast firsttimers need to remember that hindu culture is complex and bewildering the current exhibition at the british museum is a helpful introduction that distances are very large and the roads bad you must be prepared to travel for many hours between one experience and the next that the price of abdominal health is eternal vigilance and no ice plus a bit of luck that you must apply for your visa in plenty of time that you should take malaria pills and have a tetanus jab that the indian hotel and tourist industry on these main routes is highly experienced and that its standards have improved greatly in recent years that love it or hate it india as they always and truthfully say is unforgettable j m richards wrote one of the best books on goa although dating from 1982 it has been reprinted in india vikar publishing house and can be tracked down with profit j d f jones travelled for a part of his recent trip with bales tours tel 0306885991 one of a number of uk travel companies that specialises in the subcontinent fort aguada beach resort london tel 0718285909 or through any agency of the taj hotels group typical lowseason rates from now until june 12 would
