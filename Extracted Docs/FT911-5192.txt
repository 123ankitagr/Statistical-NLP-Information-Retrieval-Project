with all the communications equipment on the market today from carphones to satellite telex machines it may seem curious that up to 75 per cent of calls never get through to the right person instead the frustrated caller is bombarded with the continuous ringing or engaged tone or ends up leaving a message that may never be answered in the us but not widely yet in europe a technology is being used which helps to eliminate this problem voice messaging or voice mail where recorded messages can be left on a central recording device to be picked up the recipient nigel southon general manager of voice messaging for british telecom in the uk equates voice messaging to a spoken memo a way of leaving messages without sticking numerous bits of paper on someone's desk it's for closed user groups in medium-sized or large companies who want to replace paper with voice my paperwork has gone down by between a third to a half by using it he says several surveys carried out by companies in the us demonstrate the cost advantages of voice messaging says laura macias market development manager with octel a us voice messaging equipment manufacturer she cites the case of general electric which concluded that the company could save dollars 1,100 per year for each of its 60,000 employees by using voice messaging many companies experience payback on equipment in less than a year one company that has pioneered the use of voice messaging both in the us and europe is 3 m the materials group malcolm wollaston telecommunications manager for europe explains that in the uk 50 sales staff in the abrasives technology group were the first to use voice messaging but now there are 400 3 m users in the uk and this figure could soon rise to 1,000 in the us 12,000 3 m employees already use voice messaging as well as improving internal communications 3 m sales people give clients their voice messaging numbers and personal identification number along with their ordinary phone numbers by phoning the number and keying in the pin on the phone touchpad the client is prompted to leave a message requesting information giving an order or demanding help this information is digitised and stored on a computer hard disc wollaston emphasises the need for proper training for those with mailboxes not just in the technology but in how to get the best business advantage out of the system for example sales staff are told that they must phone in to collect their messages which are automatically played back to them every two hours this way customers can be confident that they will get a swift response to inquiries for wollaston voice messaging is only one way to maintain communications with people on the road as such competes directly with cellular phones and radiopagers and he has calculated the comparative costs of the three despite the plummeting costs of cellular radio hardware wollaston estimates that the running costs for each phone user are about pounds 700 a year taking initial purchase subscription charges and calls into consideration depending on the geographical area covered radiopagers can cost between pounds 200 and pounds 700 to run as well voice messaging services cost 3 m about pounds 360 per person wollaston cites further advantages a single bill is sent to the company with carphones you get a bill for each phone management statistics can be compiled much more easily as a result the number given can be a toll-free number if required so there is no expense to the caller this means that company sales people say can avoid the high call charges imposed by many hotels however wollaston acknowledges that different communications means are appropriate for different users in different situations voice messaging is most useful where people need to communicate specific information or where managers want to send out a single message to a number of employees the message can be duplicated electronically and if the message needs to be sent on from one person's mailbox to another that can be done by pressing a few buttons anybody who has phoned a business in the us to be greeted by a recorded message has experienced the simplest manifestation of voice messaging that of a corporate answering machine where unanswered phone calls via the office telephone system are routed to the voice messaging system southon reports increasing interest from companies whose staff are site mobile managers in retail stores hotels or restaurants who are rarely in their offices voice messaging is also proving useful for companies which operate across international boundaries and time zones glaxo britain's largest pharmaceutical company for example uses voice messaging to enable employees in its subsidiary offices in the mediterranean and middle east to call into the uk and leave messages outside the traditional uk working hours voice messaging systems can also store messages and transmit them when off-peak phone rates are in operation for small organisations such as the technology broker a company with fewer than 10 employees who flit between the two main offices in california and london voice messaging is one of the few satisfactory ways of doing business annie brooking managing director of the company explains that she rents a mailbox on an american-based service where clients can leave messages for her then she rents further mailboxes for each of her larger clients so that she can leave messages for them i have one client who i sometimes won't see for six months but i speak to him every day she says for smaller companies renting voice mailboxes from a service provider is the only option larger companies can opt to rent the service or buy their own voice messaging hardware to install alongside their corporate telephone exchange in the uk 3 m rents its service from british telecom but is considering moving to an in-house machine to reduce costs in the us it costs about dollars 4 per user per month on an in-house system reports wollaston in the us large companies often opt to use a combination of the two buying equipment for their biggest offices and renting bureau services for their smaller regional offices but in europe it is only recently with the liberalisation of telecommunications the falling costs of hardware and the cultural acceptance of recorded messages that businesses have begun to accept voice messaging european business exchange manufacturers such as ericsson gpt and siemens are now set to compete in the voice messaging market with us manufacturers such as octel at t voice mail systems and northern telecom one factor which may encourage further growth is an agreement of standards to enable voice messaging equipment from one maker to communicate with that from another but although us companies took to voice messaging like ducks to water they are only now realising some of the drawbacks in the us hackers have begun to target voice messaging networks some to gain commercial advantage more sinister says adam greenberg editor of the voice processing newsletter of probe research the us consultancy based in cedar knolls new jersey which specialises in voice messaging is the infiltration of company messaging systems by drug dealers they set up their own mailboxes with private pin numbers where they leave details of drug availability and prices frequently they use networks with toll-free numbers so the company not only unwittingly promotes the sale of drugs but pays for the privilege as well
