it was an environmental dream come true the exxon oil company announced it had completed its alaska oil spill cleanup to everyones satisfaction and by september would close up shop the man responsible for the exxon success was joe sludge who has personally shined 90 of all the rocks in valdez joe was in washington to testify in front of a congressional committee and i found him sitting by the reflecting pool cleaning oil sludge from between his toes no one thought you could do it i said joe replied i couldnt have done it without the help of the captain of the valdez and his merry crew as well as my superiors in the home office a company like exxon doesnt operate in a vacuum are you permitted to tell me how you won the environmental battle we just took a page out of vietnam we fought the good fight and then we said the hell with it well finish up next spring how many rocks did exxon polish up after the spill a lot more than anyone can imagine but it isnt just cleaning them that we should get credit for there are rocks in valdez you can eat a smoked salmon off of that is if you can find a salmon in valdez but the main point is that exxon gave it its best shot and now its mother natures turn to do some of the dirty work joe everyone knows you have been diligent in saving the shoreline of alaska but you have to admit there wouldnt have been a spill if it hadnt been for exxon shouldnt a neutral party decide when its time to hang up the towel the only ones to judge such an important matter are the stockholders after all the cost of the cleanup is coming out of their pockets most of our stockholders care more about the environment than exxon critics why is that because they have a vested interest in how much exxon spends to clean up its mess unlike environmentalists stockholders dont let sentiment interfere in tough crudeoil decisions exxon management could waffle at any time but the pragmatic stockholder never will i can see that the stockholders are less sentimental about alaskas environment but doesnt a nonnegotiable pullout jeopardize the good name of exxon no because the american people are fair they know good spills from bad spills valdez could have been a disaster if we hadnt cleaned up the rocks the alaskan shoreline is far more spic and span now than it was before the spill if exxon hadnt had such a topflight training program the brave captain of valdez might have beached his ship in san francisco harbor or perhaps in one of the great lakes i added joe said if you want the truth the reason exxon is signing off is that were sick and tired of doing everybody elses laundry do you know that i have personally cleaned rocks along the shore and i am certain that the oil on them did not come from our ship if you were so sure why didnt you just throw those rocks back in the sea i asked because exxon doesnt operate that way when it comes to oil spills our policy has always been to clean every stone with no questions asked thats why were known in the oil business as mr clean of the sea
