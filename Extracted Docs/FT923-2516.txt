drug destroys tumour cells without harming healthy tissues one longestpostponed promises medical research now last four decades patchy progress several candidate bullets undergoing clinical trials could available commercially within five years the idea using immune system create antibodies specific enough seek eliminate diseasecausing cells without damage proposed 90 years ago german microbiologist paul ehrlich and anticancer antibodies linked radioactive iodine first tested 1950s memorialsloan kettering institute us there promising experiments 1950s 1960s polyclonal mixtures antibodies available time give reliable results the real excitement started late 1970s scientists mrc laboratory molecular biology cambridge discovered make pure monoclonal antibodies researchers could produce large quantities identical antibodies designed home single target the first generation antibodybased cancer products reaching market they magic paints rather magic bullets diagnostic tests give doctors accurate image tumour traditional methods physical examination xrays the tests contain antibodies bind proteins found specific type cancer cell linked radioactive isotopes whose radiation detected outside body special camera the first test receive marketing approval imaging agent colorectal cancer produced cytogen new jersey went sale europe end last year although us food drug administration yet licensed antibodybased cancer imaging test several expected receive fda approval within next year including one lung cancer neorx seattle the development antibodybased drugs designed show cancer cells destroy slower however variety drugs clinical trials following recent progress towards overcoming problems held research 1980s monoclonal antibodies originally made mouse cells provoked unwanted immune response patients as result many antibodies destroyed reached target the solution make genetically engineered humanised antibodies active site binds cancer cell comes mouse remainder human for example campath1h antibody developed cambridge university undergoing clinical trials wellcome uk drug company contains 1 per cent rodent material provoke adverse reaction to immune system cancer cells look extremely similar normal cells there serious shortage distinctive marker proteins distinguish tumour well enough make clear target antibody drug early candidates crossreacted unexpectedly normal tissues steadily however researchers discovering better markers and diagnostic antibody distinctive marker made often developed drug only small quantities antibodies reach cells inside solid tumours poor blood supplies researchers testing various techniques getting larger amounts antibody site needed one method preload pretarget tumour nontoxic marker antibody administer second antibody kill marked cells the bullets becoming lethal there three ways antibodybased drug destroy cell knock radiation isotope poison toxic drug activate immune systems natural cellkilling mechanism the problems exist three methods gradually tackled in principle elegant safest approach use antibody activate bodys killer cells wellcomes campath1h tested 50 lymphoma patients works way and biotechnology companies trying different ways boosting natural mechanism for example medarex based new jersey developing bispecific antibodies two antibodies joined together one binds cancer cell directs killer cells towards target the company plans test next year patients melanoma lethal skin cancer glioma neuroblastoma two cancers brain nervous systems but antibodies powerful enough destroy solid tumours for antibody linked radioactive isotope traditional approach toxin then risk serious side effects warhead becomes detached reaching target much research effort past 15 years devoted finding ways joining isotope toxin firmly antibody without interfering power bind cancer cells several different isotopes tested including iodine131 yttrium90 astatine211 indium111 neorx developing products based rhenium186 starting ovarian cancer treatment the range powerful drugs toxins linked experimental antibodies even greater a favourite ricin one powerful plant toxins known single molecule kill cell companies developing ricinlinked antibodies include immunogen massachusetts whose oncolysin b tested leukaemia lymphoma patients ici uk whose d0490 start clinical trials celltech uk american cyanamid us collaborating another promising project antibody linked calicheamicin potent cytotoxic drug derived originally fungi it due begin clinical studies leukaemia breast cancer patients within next months an alternative approach pioneered kenneth bagshawe londons charing cross hospital funding cancer research campaign antibodydirected enzymeprodrug therapy adept this twostage process patient treated first antibody linked bacterial enzyme later prodrug chemical relatively nontoxic converted enzyme potent cellkilling drug smallscale clinical trials adept treatments colorectal cancer taking place past 18 months collaboration ici despite recent progress however research required hone antibodies reliable cancer drugs antibody engineering make possible design artificial antibodies far smaller accurate bullets anything available today another possibility use hormone growth factor instead antibody guide toxins receptor sites cancer cells the company pioneering approach seragen based massachusetts testing range fusion toxins consisting diphtheria toxins linked interleukin epidermal growth factor since conventional chemotherapy radiation surgery still fail cure tumours potential market innovative cancer treatments worth several billion dollars year although new genetic technologies antisense drugs gene therapy offer promising alternative
