scientists at international business machines adstar data storage division in san jose california have achieved a breakthrough that is expected to increase the amount of data that can be stored on a computer disc drive by a factor of about 30 by the end of the decade the adstar scientists predict their new method of producing a phenomenon called giant magneto-resistance' will make it possible to store up to 10 bn bits of information per square inch of the surface of a computer disc this is roughly equivalent to storing all of the text of 10,000 300-page novels on a double-sided 3.5 inch hard disc drive magneto-resistance is a change in the electrical resistance of a material when it is in the presence of a magnetic field ibm has pioneered the use of this phenomenon in data storage systems data is stored on computer disc in the form of minute magnetised spots when a magneto-resistive sensor or head skims over the surface of the rotating disc it passes through the tiny magnetic fields produced by these dots and its electrical resistance is changed producing a signal that reads the bits of data stored on the disc however as the density of data stored on computer discs increases the magnetic spots become smaller and smaller and it becomes more difficult to detect their magnetic fields the giant magneto-resistive effect represents a potential solution to this problem it produces an electrical signal more than five times stronger than that produced by heads based on conventional magneto-resistive technology until now laboratory demonstrations of giant magneto-resistance have required exotic materials very low temperatures or complex processes however the ibm researchers have designed a giant magneto-resistive sensor that is relatively simple to make it is based upon a stack of very thin layers of magnetic nickel-iron alloy and non-magnetic silver materials fabricated using standard semiconductor production techniques each layer of material is only about two billionths of a meter thick the structure is then annealed in a furnace to align the magnetic poles of adjacent layers in opposite directions when the structure is placed in a magnetic field all of the magnetic layers align in the same direction producing a giant signal adstar now plans to move the technology into its development laboratories to make prototype disc drive heads capable of reading data stored on a disc the next step will be to optimise the materials and processes for mass production the technology is expected to appear in products in about three years there should be no fundamental problems in transferring the technology from the laboratory to manufacturing says kevin coffey one of the group of adstar scientists that has worked on the project ibm has patent applications pending on the structure and the process for producing its giant magneto-resistive sensors an unusual aspect of the giant magneto-resisitive sensor development is that it was conducted within the ibm product group rather than at the company's research laboratories the research was conducted as part of an ibm fellow programme under the leadership of kent howard one of ibm's leading scientists who was made an ibm fellow three years ago the programme gives ibm's top scientists great latitude to pursue their research interests and work directly with product groups for computer users the development promises higher density and lower cost data storage this is becoming increasingly important with the advent of multi-media computing requiring storage of large quantities of data including video voice and graphics as well as text
