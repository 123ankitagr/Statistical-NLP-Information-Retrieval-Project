Charles Grant Craig ( Glendale Section Letters , July 6 ) takes Ginger Bremberg to task for her comments on the homeless . I missed the article . However , his quotation of her remarks makes it difficult for me to see his point or argue with her . As to the point about the homeless not being there by choice , well , Charles my friend , you need some `` non-pathetic enlightenment . '' Certainly there are some who are victims of circumstance . However , he needs to look at the makeup of the 600,000 ( not the media/liberal-hyped million or million and a half ) . U.S. News & World Report ( March 20 ) reported that 33 % to 38 % are alcoholics , 13 % to 25 % are drug users and 21 % to 24 % have served prison time or have a felony conviction . Daily News Digest , Phoenix . Those who are mentally ill used to be cared for by the state but someone decided we should n't be `` warehousing '' them and depriving them of their freedom . There is a problem ; the answers are difficult , but recognize that many are there by choice . W. F. JONES Glendale
