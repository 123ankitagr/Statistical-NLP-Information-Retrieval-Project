Two San Joaquin Valley counties were accused in Fresno of violating the federal Clean Air Act by failing to meet air quality standards . Three environmentalist groups -- Citizens for a Healthy Environment , Sierra Club and Kern County Valley Action Network -- filed suit in U.S. District Court , calling for the federal Environmental Protection Agency to impose sanctions on Kern and Fresno counties for failing to meet a 1987 compliance deadline . The suit alleges that the two counties have `` consistently violated the federal health standards for ozone . ''
