as 150 elderly persons loudly protested outside assemblyman dan hauser conducted hearings in los angeles on thursday into local rent control laws that he claims drive away badly needed apartment development in california but a parade of officials from west hollywood santa monica berkeley and los angeles instead urged hauser to turn his critical eye to cities without rent control claiming that california's rent-control cities are leaders in the building and rehabilitating of low-income housing hauser's aide stephen holloway said the premise of the hearing was that the more stringent the rent control the less affordable housing is built hauser d-arcata chairman of the assembly committee on housing and community development has authored a bill to allow the state to intervene in rent-control laws hauser's featured speaker anthony downs a rent-control foe and free market advocate from the brookings institution said regulations such as rent control and downzoning are a central cause of high housing prices and rents in california downs singled out cities with strict rent controls such as west hollywood and santa monica but was challenged by officials of those cities to compare their housing records with areas where no rent controls exist what you should focus on is the lack of affordable housing in non-rent control cities west hollywood councilman john heilman said what you'll find is that their shortages of affordable housing and housing problems are far worse in a testy exchange with state assemblyman tom hayden d-west los angeles downs claimed that housing construction in santa monica has fallen dramatically since the adoption of rent control 10 years ago a situation that he said will drive up rents in the long run demanding that downs produce proof hayden responded santa monica in fact creates a higher percentage per capita of affordable housing than any city in the state it's the envy of the state there's no evidence after 10 years under rent control that your ideology is correct the hearing was described by several city officials as the launching of a statewide effort by landlord groups to wrest control from cities and allow the state to decide when rent control is proper hauser a rural legislator known for his timber and outdoor expertise does not represent any cities with urban housing problems he has proposed a bill that would allow the state to alter or abolish strict rent controls in cities if the state determines that the laws hurt housing development hauser knows cows not tenants said larry gross a longtime west hollywood rent-control activist why is he crusading against cities who are going out of their way to attack the housing crisis and why is he bringing in a rent-control foe like tony downs outside a throng of mostly elderly protesters carried an effigy of an affordable home sitting in a coffin and chanted hey hey ho ho dan hauser's got to go one man carried a sign reading don't make grandpas homeless while another said more housing less hauser hauser insisted however that he was not fighting rent control but was instead trying to boost housing construction in cities where controls might dampen developer enthusiasm he said he is concerned about laws in a handful of cities that prevent landlords from raising rents on vacant units by contrast in los angeles rents are protected only until a unit is vacated at which time the landlord can raise it to any level he chooses known as vacancy decontrol it has allowed rents here to escalate 110 since 1980 while providing some protection to renters as long as they do not move city officials said in a 1988 study downs found that mild rent controls such as los angeles do not hurt development but he contends that cities that prevent landlords from boosting rents on empty units are wrongly keeping rents from rising to whatever the market will bear removing controls from a choicely located but still solidly middle-class city such as santa monica may eventually exclude almost all low-income and moderate-income households and permit only wealthy residents to live there downs wrote in his study but that is an inherent and essential aspect of the free market system despite many studies on the rent-control issue there is little clear-cut evidence that rent control is the underlying cause of downturns in housing development studies show that apartment development is more directly hampered by regional economic downturns restrictive land-use laws and downzoning the removal of federal tax incentives for investors speculation that drives up residential land costs in boom areas volatile interest rates and the shunning of poor areas by lenders seattle which has no rent control suffered a 24 decline in apartment construction in the 1980 s according to downs study meanwhile los angeles with rent control enjoyed a 14.7 surge in such construction in the 1980 s it bettered san diego which has no rent control and whose apartment construction increased 14.3 driven in large part by the west coast land boom rents in both los angeles and san diego have skyrocketed in the 1980 s according to the joint center for housing studies at harvard the center found that regardless of whether rent controls exist rents in california have far outstripped inflation or minor increases in local family earnings san diego california's largest city without rent control is the most expensive city in the nation with a median rent of 628, the center said economists often argue that removing rent controls could increase the supply of housing and lower rental prices in the long run but urban planners and sociologists often counter that low-income housing was abandoned by the free market years before rent controls were adopted in the late 1970 s and early 1980 s in fact low-income housing in california is built largely through government subsidies and intervention moreover according to a study on rental housing by richard appelbaum chairman of the department of sociology at uc santa barbara landlords do not behave competitively by lowering rents on long-vacant apartments as would be expected under natural laws of supply and demand he found that landlords will not lower rents until vacancy rates in a region climb to 8 or 10 a rare condition that has not existed in most urban areas for many years housing track records figures below show the number of low-income housing units built or rehabilitated since 1986 by california cities with rent controls compared to the amount of low-income
