in the emerging battle for the attention of asia's television viewers star television the hong kong-based satellite tv company is no shrinking violet talk to senior star executives and you will hear forecasts of dramatic growth within the industry they predict the number of broadcast tv channels to expand from the current five free-to-air channels to anything from 80 to 100, mostly pay channels by 1996 underlying this outlook is a strategy of dominance in the skies by seeking to corner available and soon to be available satellite capacity and on the ground by tying down cable tv distributors company executives say money is not a problem the main reason for this they say is star's owner star is 50 per cent owned by mr li ka-shing one of hong kong's wealthiest men with the rest owned by hutchison whampoa which mr li also controls another reason is that of the dollars 600 m committed in 1991 to star and its sister company media assets which buys programming only dollars 360 m has so far been spent star began broadcasting in may 1991 and by the end of the year it had five free-to-air channels running 24 hours a day according to research commissioned by star by february this year more than 45 m viewers in 38 countries from china to indonesia and japan to afghanistan were tuning into one of its five chan-nels it is these sort of figures that have attracted us and british media companies the initial interest from mr rupert murdoch's news corporation and pearson the diversified uk conglomerate was for equity participation in star tv itself these preliminary discussions are believed to have foundered on the issue of control star executives say that mr li for the foreseeable future does not want to cede control of the network to any outsider mr murdoch appears to have retreated to consider his next move while pearson's current aim these executives say is now more modest it could result in joint venture deals for an english-language education channel which would dovetail well with pearson's educational books expertise and co-operation on a planned business news channel indeed star's preferred relationship with potential partners is of the joint venture type four of the five channels it currently broadcasts bbc world service news mtv prime sports and a mandarin chinese station are this type of arrangement we want to do partnership deals at channel level says mr julian mounter star's recently installed chief executive we are talking to a lot of people about equity in channels there has been considerable interest in wanting to invest in our free-to-air service or our subscription service by the end of this year or early next year star plans to begin broadcasting five more pay-tv channels as satellite capacity expands so star plans to acquire the use of more transponders or transmitters and push out more tv channels especially pay channels when we start subscription services we will be able to move from pan-regional to a whole series of national opportunities mr mounter says star is also investing in new broadcast technology based on digital compression and may well be the first commercial broadcaster to use it digital compression allows a single transponder to broadcast up to eight separate tv channels at once the company currently broadcasts on an asiasat satellite hutchison owns a third of asiasat together with cable and wireless and citic beijing's international investment arm where it has 11 transponders of 24 and exclusive rights to broadcast tv internationally asiasat plans to launch asiasat2 towards the end of 1994 or early 1995 and apt satellite a mainland chinese consortium will launch apstar2 around the same time both satellites will have large footprints the area where a tv signal can be received covering up to 75 per cent of the world's population and extending from tokyo to berlin and ulan bator to hobart star has an option to take eight transponders on asiasat2 of a total of 32 it was recently reported that it has signed a dollars 350 m deal with apt to lease 20 of apstar2's 34 transponders when asked if the report were true mr mounter was evasive only saying we have a deal with asiasat and nothing has changed in both cases star is believed to be seeking exclusive rights thereby squeezing out potential us and european competitors which might want to start a rival network but star's position is not as strong as it may want others to believe it is based as much on weakness as it is on strength if star is to realise its ambition to corner the market it will need the outside capital which co-operative deals with other operators or programming providers brings the li family may even have to consider outside equity par-ticipation at the company level in addition to the channel level the costs of leasing transponders are high dollars 1.25 m to dollars 1.5 m a year each and so is investment in new broadcast technology such as digital compression star is reluctant to talk about costs associated with this and the cost of its back-up satellite link station in thailand an indication of size of the start-up costs and their impact on a large company was given in 1991 when hutchison star's joint owner made a controversial change to its accounting policies for its telecoms and media businesses it changed from the accepted accruals method of accounting to one where costs and revenues are accounted for as they are paid or received also it decided to amortise start-up costs and expenses over periods of up to 10 years star will provide no details of its financial situation including advertising revenues mr mounter claims that advertising revenues are growing strongly he also contends that asia is a more homogeneous advertising market than europe asians have more of corporate view of life they do not have a resistance to pan-national campaigns he claims star appears closer to cracking one early problem it encountered programming there was early resistance to selling star software because it was broadcast to so many countries providers were concerned that they could not sell theirs in local markets to distribute to 38 countries is expensive says mr mounter the profit after expenses of distributing to them all is small so when they equate what they can get from coming to a one-stop-shop like us with the difficulties of revenue collection in asia they are beginning to think again
