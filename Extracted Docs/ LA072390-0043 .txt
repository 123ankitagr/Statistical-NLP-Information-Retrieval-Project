American jazz pianist and occasional singer Joe Turner , a longtime resident of France and in the 1960s a fixture at Paris ' La Calvados club , died Saturday in Paris . Reuters news agency said he was 82 but did not disclose a cause of death . Turner , who in his career accompanied such jazz stars as Louis Armstrong and Benny Carter , was born in Baltimore but moved to Europe after World War II where he had toured earlier with singer Adelaide Hall . In 1976 , Turner , sometimes confused with blues singer Joseph ( Big Joe ) Turner , returned to the United States and played at the Cookery in New York City , where his stride piano style was acclaimed anew . He recorded with his own trio in the late 1970s .
