SALOMON , the US securities house , has had about Dollars 8bn of outstanding debt downgraded by Standard & Poor 's , the US credit rating agency . The downgrade , which could push up the cost of Salomon 's borrowings , reflected the firm 's reliance on proprietary trading activity 'which has increased its vulnerability to quarterly earnings volatility , ' S & P said . Salomon 's longer-term senior debt rating was cut to single A minus from single A . Its subordinated debt rating fell to triple B plus from single A minus . Preferred stock received a rating of triple B from triple B plus , and the commercial paper rating was cut to A-2 from A-1 . Mr Donald Howard , chief financial officer said : 'Some rating agencies focus too heavily on the short-term volatility of Salomon 's earnings and give inadequate weight to our results measured over longer time-frames and to the exceptional quality and liquidity of our assets .
