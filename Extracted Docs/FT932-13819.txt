hopes of further substantial cuts in german interest rates following today's meeting of the bundesbank policy-making council were damped yesterday after the german central bank released figures showing that broad money supply climbed at twice economists expectations in march broad money supply traditionally the german central bank's key indicator in its fight against inflation grew at an annualised and seasonally adjusted rate of 3.2 per cent economists had hoped for an increase of at most 1.5 per cent after a slight reduction in m3 in both january and february disappointment with the figures combined with poor news coming from bonn about the scale of germany's public sector public sector deficit helped prompt a fall in german bond prices yields on 10-year bonds climbed from 6.59 to 6.63 per cent a pattern reflected in other european bond markets a contradictory impulse came from the bundesbank's money market operations yesterday the central bank cut the securities repurchase rate the so-called repo rate at which it offers wholesale funds to the country's banking system to 8.09 per cent from 8.11 per cent a week ago the move was in line with a sequence of small cuts in recent weeks at the same time the bundesbank injected a net dm5 8 bn into the banking system helping to drive overnight money market rates down sharply from 8.20 to 8.09 per cent this led to speculation that in spite of the m3 figure the bundesbank may today cut money market rates still further for example by announcing a fixed rate of less than 8 per cent for next week's repo the bundesbank blamed high credit growth for the increase in m3 which includes cash current accounts and short-term deposits bank lending to the private sector was dm23 2 bn last month a fraction below the dm24 1 bn in march last year over the last six months bank lending to the private sector rose at an annualised seasonally adjusted rate of 9 cent the bundesbank said economists said that much of the increase was attributable to special factors such as an unexpected rise in public sector borrowing they pointed out that even if the march figure was disappointing it did nothing to alter expectations that the target for m3 growth this year 4.5 to 6.5 per cent would be met comfortably last year m3 grew at 9.4 per cent compared to a target of 3.5 to 5.5 per cent the worst performance since targeting was introduced 18 years before on march 18 the bundesbank cut its discount rate by 0.5 per cent to 7.5 per cent leaving the lombard rate at 9 per cent the central bank is holding a press conference today saying it wanted to present its 1992 annual report in detail however such press conferences are unusual and the central bank may take the opportunity to cut rates further denmark's nationalbank the central bank reduced its key money market rates from 10.25 to 10 per cent yesterday describing the move as bringing danish rates into line with falling interest rates in other european centres writes hilary barnes in copenhagen the danish krone came under speculative pressure in early february when money market rates for a few days rose to over 40 per cent but interest rates have since then come down steadily
