new light is shed on the reasons for a series of sinkings among dry bulk carriers during the late1980s and early1990s in a report published recently charles batchelor transport correspondent writes from london a total of 64 dry bulk carriers and orebulkoil carriers obos were lost in the three years from 19911993 prompting concerns about the way dry bulk vessels which typically carry iron ore or coal were built and the advanced age of the fleet but many of the losses were of obos which can carry either dry bulk or oil as cargo while navigational error was a more important reason for loss than structural or engineering problems according to a new study by intercargo the international association of dry cargo shipowners obos are often much larger than dry bulk carriers and are subdivided into separate tanks for oil which makes them more difficult to sink but they are more vulnerable to explosions difficult to maintain and more prone to corrosion in 1992 the loss of nine obos disguised a sharp fall in dry bulk losses to 20 from 28 the previous year analysis of total loss and fatality statistics 19911993 intercargo 17 bell court house 1112 blomfield street london ec2m 7ay free
