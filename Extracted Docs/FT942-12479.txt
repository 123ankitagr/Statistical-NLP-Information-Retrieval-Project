demand for the first drug proven to have an effect against multiple sclerosis betaseron outstrips supply to such an extent that a lottery is used to decide which patients should receive it when schering of germany launched betaseron last september in the us the only country in which it is licensed for sale doctors registered 80,000 ms patients who wanted the drug the company's computer then picked 15,000 at random to begin treatment at a cost of dollars 9,500 pounds 6,500 a year each schering's us subsidiary berlex says 20,000 patients are now receiving injections of betaseron a form of beta-interferon and a further 20,000 are preparing to start treatment chiron the californian biotechnology company which manufactures betaseron for berlex from genetically engineered bacteria is increasing production rapidly it forecasts that the us waiting list will have disappeared by 1995 schering hopes to submit a european licence application for betaseron next month european supplies will be manufactured by germany's boehringer ingelheim meanwhile two competing beta-interferons developed by ares-serono of switzerland and biogen of the us are moving through clinical trials in ms patients ian broadhurst a pharmaceutical analyst with bnp capital markets predicts that betaseron will not enjoy more than two years free from competition though it could still bring schering dm600m pounds 250 m in sales in 1995 besides the interferons many other new generation ms drugs are at various stages of research and development a bnp report last month listed 25 commercial r d projects in progress around the world the most advanced are shown in the table together they represent progress on a broad front against ms the most common disease of the nervous system in young adults which affects an estimated 2 m people worldwide effective ms treatments could give the pharmaceutical industry a huge new market potential us sales are dollars 1.8 bn a year according to an estimate by genetic technology news a biotechnology newsletter although the precise molecular cause of ms is not yet known scientists agree that it is an auto-immune disease in the same broad category as rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes the body's immune system which is intended to defend it against germs and other foreign invaders turns against its own cells the self-attack is probably triggered by a combination of genetic and environmental factors in ms white blood cells t-cells destroy the protein sheath called myelin which protects nerve fibres this stops the nerves working properly and the patient begins to lose control of muscles symptoms include partial paralysis blurred vision and speech difficulties but the progress of ms is variable in the worst cases of chronic-progressive ms the neurological problems become steadily more severe and eventually kill the patient in relapsing-remitting ms the disease flares up at unpredictable intervals and may even disappear spontaneously neither beta-interferon nor the other experimental drugs can cure ms but for the first time they do promise a significant amelioration in the disease until now doctors have only been able to offer patients comfort therapy such as pain-killers and anti-inflammatory drugs which control some of the symptoms but have no effect on the underlying disease ms specialists such as george ebers a canadian neurologist at the university hospital london ontario are understandably cautious about claims for new treatments because there have been so many false dawns therapies which have been widely used but found on further study to be ineffective for example hyperbaric oxygen treatment subjecting the patient to high pressure oxygen became fashionable in the 1970 s and was discredited in the 1980 s researchers also claimed success with drugs such as cyclophosphamide and cyclosporin which suppress the patient's whole immune system but these too turned out to be ineffective against ms when tested properly the only acceptable clinical test is a double-blind randomised placebo-controlled trial patients are divided at random into two groups one of which receives the drug and the other an identical dummy and neither patients nor investigators know until the end who is getting what tested under those conditions on patients with relapsing-remitting ms betaseron reduced the number of attacks by one third and reduced significantly the amount of nerve damage shown by magnetic resonance imaging but as ian mcdonald of london university's institute of neurology points out betaseron has not yet been shown to have any effect on patients long-term development of disability interferons are natural proteins which perform a wide range of functions including modulating the immune system all three kinds alpha beta and gamma have been tested on ms alpha had no effect while gamma made the disease worse scientists now believe natural gamma-interferon may play a role in the progression of ms it is not clear how beta-interferon brings about an improvement according to ares-serono it may both decrease the activity of the immune cells that destroy myelin and counteract the disease-enhancing effects of gamma-interferon the ares-serono and biogen beta-interferons differ slightly from betaseron they are made by genetically engineered mammalian cells rather than by bacteria cultures as a result they have sugar chains on the protein surface like natural human interferon but unlike the schering product in theory this could give them a clinical advantage in terms of fewer side-effects and improved efficacy but there is no evidence to show whether they work better in practice most of the other ms treatments under development aim to disable the specific part of the immune system that is responsible for ms without suppressing the other immune functions that are essential for fighting disease those most advanced in the development process include deoxyspergualin dsg a natural bacterial extract discovered by nippon kayaku in japan and developed by hoechst of germany it suppresses harmful t-cells and may also stimulate the regrowth of damaged myelin if clinical trial results due next month are encouraging hoechst will apply for a marketing licence regulatory approval could follow quickly since dsg is not a genetically engineered product myloral a formulation of bovine cow myelin developed by autoimmune a massachusetts biotechnology company it is an oral tolerance therapy the patient is fed the protein so that the immune system comes to tolerate it and therefore is less inclined to attack his or her own myelin after promising early results myloral is now in large-scale clinical trials copolymer-1 cop-1 a synthetic chemical resembling myelin protein developed by teva in israel when injected into the patient this decoy attracts the immune cells away from the real myelin it is in the final stage of clinical trials at earlier stages of development the biotechnology industry is testing several experimental drugs including antibodies and vaccines these are aimed either at specific types of t-cell which the researchers believe are responsible for the immune attack in ms or at antigens in the myelin which provoke the attack however there is vigorous debate between ms specialists about whether the fundamental defect lies in a very narrow sub-group of t-cells in which case a specific drug could in theory cure the disease or whether a wider range of immune cells are responsible if so ms will be harder to treat ebers inclines to the latter view even so he says the mood among a sceptical audience is now approaching optimism the series continues next month with a look at blood products articles over the last six months have looked
