The interplay of order and chance are at work in painted steel , wall-mounted sculptures by William Dwyer . Using different gauges of wire , from thick and stalwart in `` Compression Square '' to thin and spidery in `` One x One Factor , '' Dwyer makes three-dimensional grids often broken up by several inch lengths of brightly painted wire . As the viewer looks through the grids , patterns of line and color emerge , sometimes producing a taut de Stijl arrangement , sometimes looking like the layout of a micro chip . `` Compression Square '' looks too much like those awful wrought iron window guards necessitated by urban living , and other works are overly tame . `` Zenith '' effectively manipulates interactions between the viewing space , viewers ' perceptions of color and depth and that old standby : pleasant design .
