Photography buffs can now buy a camera that senses what part of a picture the photographer 's eye is focused on , writes Michael Kenward . The new Canon EOS-5 incorporates an intelligent automatic focusing system which homes in on the area of the image where the eye is looking . A small infra-red light-emitting diode in the single-lens 35mm reflex camera illuminates the eye as it looks into the viewfinder . Sensors in the camera analyse the pattern of reflected light and discover where the eye is looking . The camera 's electronics then pick out which of five focusing points is nearest to where the eye is directed , and the lens automatically focuses on that point . The EOS-5 sells for Pounds 499.99 and goes on sale in the UK next month . Canon : UK , 081 773 3173 .
