Rent control officials are recommending that rents be allowed to go up 3.5 % this year , slightly more than last year 's increase but below the national average of rising rents . The 3.5 % increase will be the subject of a public hearing tonight at 7:30 at a Rent Control Board meeting in City Hall . Under Santa Monica 's strict rent control law , the board votes on an annual increase that landlords are allowed to begin charging in September . The increase last year was 3 % and has averaged about 4 % each year since rent control was enacted a decade ago . Nationally over the same period , rents have risen an average of 6.5 % per year , according to a 1987 study . The average rent in Santa Monica is $ 480 , according to the rent control agency . If the 3.5 % increase is approved , landlords must notify their tenants in writing and certify that there are no outstanding citations or uncorrected building code violations against the property .
