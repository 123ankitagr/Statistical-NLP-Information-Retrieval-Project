because many hassidic jews regard television as impious they will not have seen the play that has caused the controversy wall of silence bbc1 sunday comedy writers laurence marks and maurice gran both jewish set a murder mystery in the strictly orthodox mysterious hassidic community in north london which sounded promising and was mysterious enough but by the end i still had no idea how the estateagent with the gentile wife in bristol fitted in nor how the lady with a fractured skull underneath her ultraorthodox wig came to be sitting on a train the greater mystery was how such poppycock ever achieved the screen one slot marks and grans comedy background showed in wooden dialogue preposterous characters and huge signposts to tell viewers what is going to happen next the police chief agrees to lend his car to a colleague have you seen the way he treats his car gov cautions a minion surprise surprise the hero pc mullens bill paterson writes it off in the next scene the story starts when the corpse of a kosher butcher is pulled from a canal in his volvo a swastika daubed on the bonnet but this is no racial murder as pc mullens realises when he is informed implausibly late in the day that the corpse had been stabbed through the eyes mullins duly expounds more customs of the hassidim the butcher must have been a moyser or informant to have been killed by this grisly ritual on radio 4s sunday programme orthodox jews expressed fears a touch unrealistic to my mind that viewers might link eyestabbing to the ancient libel about jews ritually murdering christian children and incite antisemitism according to the jewish chronicle the upshot was that pc mullenss spiel was altered to include the qualifying comments about eyestabbing being entirely alien to british jewry however a closer look suggests that this was a strangely grudging and partial appeasement the encyclopaedia judaicas discussion of legal penalties for moysers the source i would guess for marks and gran gives no record of anyone ever being treated thus although some european rabbi seems to have favoured mutilation as a lesser punishment than excommunication so why did gran and marks get it wrong it is legitimate to write plays about hassidim or any other religious group but the odder and more alien the group appears to the rest of society the more it behoves a playwright to strive to be accurate assignment the price of gold bbc 2 tuesday spelled out something i should have known the vital link between a decade of gold prospecting in brazil and the destruction of the rain forest julian pettifers interesting report painted a vivid picture of the frontier mentality of amazon mining towns the gold prospectors are as one would expect tough uneducated men who have little faith that they will make old bones a bullet a mining accident or malaria will probably get them first very low down their list of anxieties if anywhere at all are the longterm health risks of using mercury mercury is banned but it is used in large quantities it is mixed with the sludge dredged from the river because it bonds to the gold particles some of this mercury is released into the river and a great deal more is burnt off with blowlamps this vapor mixes with ash from burning the forests the result is high levels of mercury in the atmosphere above the amazon and in some unspecified circumstances methyl mercury forming in the rivers this deadly substance passes up the food chain and ends up in fish eaten by the riverside dwellers how serious are the healthrisks is as yet unclear scientists are keener to analyse satellite data than to brave the amazon to study its poisoned inhabitants however experts spoke of a timebomb which will inevitably go off even if the goldprospectors can be persuaded to burn off mercury in retorts which is cheaper as well as safe minister for the amazon and environment mr rubens rimpero referred to levels of metal mercury being higher than those in an industrial accident at minemata in japan pettifer reminded us that fish contaminated with methyl mercury caused hundreds of deaths and led to thousands of children being born with disabilities momentarily my willingness to follow mr pettifer dipped the consequences of minemata must be known with more precision why are documentarymakers so often cavalier with statistics the statistics of the waco siege are clear enough 84 corpses 20 of them children anything but clear as we were reminded by panorama sinful messiah bbc 1 monday is whether the fbi were justified in mounting the assault on the branch davidian headquarters fresh material given to panorama a taped conversation between cultleader david koresh and his lawyer late in the siege suggests that koresh did not want masssuicide koresh explained that he was delaying until he had finished writing the revelations of the twelfth seal this the fbi dismissed as mere bluff so koreshs deadline was literally that however the first chapters of the book were found on the wordprocessor which will be the lucky publisher who lays hands on the sinful messiahs final revelations timewatch a hidden history bbc 2 800 told the story of another kind of deadly fanaticism which led ten republicans to starve themselves to death in the maze prison hunger strike of 1981 survivors talked about the experience one of them describing the sensation as being like having ones brain rubbed with a grater this wellresearched documentary aired allegations that despite the thatcher governments claims not to have struck any deal with the republican prisoners negotiations were conducted throughout the strike and concessions were quietly made after it ended the programmes weakness was to have left the attitude of the catholic church so unclear especially as maze chaplain father dennis faul played a prominent part in the drama and was interviewed at some length what seemed to emerge was that fasting in protest was permissible indeed as i recall st patrick was said to have fasted against an uncooperative king however the hierarchys attitude to the hungerstrike changed when it was deemed that the protestors intended to die once across this rather fine line they would presumably have committed suicide a mortal sin for catholics if this was indeed the case the fact that papal emissaries brought bobby sands a golden crucifix before he died needed some explanation
