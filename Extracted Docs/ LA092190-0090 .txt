Santa Clarita and Newhall Land & Farming Co. officials are expected to announce today an agreement that would provide city financial aid for the company 's proposed Valencia Town Center , the first major retail outlet in the region . Mayor Jo Anne Darcy said Thursday morning that an agreement had been reached by city and company officials who had been negotiating since July . But a few hours later city officials said they were still hammering out final details of the pact . `` We 're very close , '' city spokeswoman Gail Foy said . Foy and Marlee Lauffer , a Newhall Land spokeswoman , declined to discuss what had sidetracked the negotiations . Any agreement is subject to approval by the City Council . That approval could come as early as Tuesday . Newhall Land , the Santa Clarita Valley 's largest developer , in July asked the city to issue bonds to pay for $ 12.8 million in road improvements in and around the 80-acre mall . A Newhall Land consultant said the $ 180-million project could not proceed without city financing . The bonds would be paid off with sales taxes generated by the mall and would not require the city to dip into its treasury , company officials said . The City Council rejected the request for $ 12.8 million and ordered city staff members to negotiate a lower figure . As an enticement , Newhall Land has offered to let the city annex about 150 acres of company property . Some residents have urged the city to turn its back on the company , saying local government should not subsidize a private enterprise , especially one as influential as Newhall Land . Company officials countered that many California cities , including Burbank and Palmdale , have agreed to subsidize new malls by floating bonds that will be paid off with sales taxes .
