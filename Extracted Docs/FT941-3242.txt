Caribbean rum producers are visiting several European capitals next week to urge the European Union to increase its rum quota in the short term and eventually abolish it altogether . Producers says there is a rum shortage in the EU but they are facing growing opposition from France to any increase in shipments . The West Indies Rum and Spirits Producers ' Association alleges that the French prime minister has told the European Commission that France is against any changes to the current quota and will not support its abolition . The Caribbean producers are asking for a 10 per cent increase in the quota of 214,000 hectolitres per year , and the abolition of the quota by 1996 . The conditions for access to the European rum market are contained in a protocol of the Lome Convention , a trade and aid treaty between the Union and the African , Caribbean and Pacific group of countries . The rum producers have criticised the EU for being slow to honour legal commitments to react automatically by increasing the access for rum to meet growing demand .
