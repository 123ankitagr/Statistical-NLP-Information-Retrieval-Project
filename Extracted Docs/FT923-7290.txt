if you are over 45 and have at least four drinks a day after work you should be concerned yet most managers are reluctant to face the problem of alcohol abuse despite the quantity and quality of research on the subject my own findings suggest that managers have a folkloric understanding of alcohol's effects when asked about their weekly consumption of alcohol more than 80 per cent ignored wine and beer counting only spirits as alcohol adding to the misunderstanding are the old wives tales about alcohol more than 60 per cent of interviewed managers believe that alcohol is good for the heart or helps in digestion alcohol is the principal means by which the highly stressed manager can anaesthetize himself moreover many executives still see alcohol as a lubricant for contacts and deals and do plenty of business around alcohol alcohol can be a source of enjoyment but is it part of your problem or your solution the chances are that alcohol is a problem if you are drinking more than 28 units per week a unit is a glass of wine bottle of beer or a shot of spirits researchers from barcelona recently published in the new england journal of medicine results of studies which demonstrated that the muscle fibres of the heart are weakened by heavy drinking the framingham study of nearly 5,000 people confirmed that instead of being cardio-protective' heavy alcohol use can be toxic to the heart and skeletal muscle causing dangerous enlargement of the pumping chambers of the heart when used injudiciously alcohol impairs a full range of functions both cerebral memory concentration judgement and learning and physical sexual co-ordination balance and speech it has been estimated that more than 60 per cent of liver cirrhosis irreparable scarring of the liver is caused by alcohol and you need not be a problem drinker to develop alcoholic's liver disease alcohol is also a rich source of non-nutritive calories and therefore heavy drinking is associated with weight gain and vitamin deficiency moreover alcohol can cause marked water and mineral losses leaving you tired and weak some managers already recognise all this and no longer view drinking as a rite of passage for advancement in international business life for the rest the first step is to know where you stand start by counting the number of drinks you have in a typical week both at work and at home maintaining a ceiling of 3 drinks per day is by most estimates probably safe binge drinking is to be avoided to gauge your relationship to alcohol abstain from drinking for two or three weeks and see how you react are you easily irritated is your sleep pattern disturbed did you lose weight if the answer to any of these questions is yes consider cutting back to one to two drinks per day with meals as up to 25 per cent of alcohol can be absorbed through the stomach wall never drink alcohol on an empty stomach buffer the effects with fruit juice or water before sending down your first drink this can prevent the gastric irritation caused by alcohol that can impair digestion to avoid the dehydrating effects of alcohol make every other drink at a business function a non-alcoholic one after an evening of drinks consume water freely to avoid the dreaded hangover by weaving these measures into your working life you will be able to lubricate business deals while avoiding the slippery slope that can lead to ill-health poor professional performance and failed marriages the author is the medical director of the insead business health course
