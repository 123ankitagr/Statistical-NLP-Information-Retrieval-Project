marlboro has done a bangup job but cocacola almost blew it att is right on target but sears may have lost it although americas biggest companies are spending tens of billions of dollars each year to create and nurture their brand images most are going about it the wrong way that is the conclusion of a fiveyear consumer study to be unveiled in new york today by the ad agency n w ayer inc in the 1990s the study warns marketers are running the risk of losing touch with consumers the problem most companies still dont know how to reach consumers through their brands more than anything else brand image consists of the qualities that consumers associate with a brand and the emotional reaction that those qualities produce a favorable reaction can often result in a decision to buy one product over another marlboros macho cowboy and atts image of reliability have long succeeded in luring customers but marketing experts say consumers can be easily confused over what a brand stands for such as when coke introduced its new formula or when sears suddenly announced a policy of everyday low prices brands have to become much more human so that people can relate to them in a human way said fred posner an ayer executive vice president who oversaw the study you need a personality and a consistency but you cant just claim in your advertising that you have a personality that personality he said has to be consistent in the product as well as its packaging pricing and promotion the 90s will be a period of searching for identity in an increasingly confused and chaotic world said posner in just one hour of watching television the typical consumer sees about 30 different commercials most of which are 15 or 30 seconds long on a daily basis the average consumer is bombarded with an estimated 3000 commercial messages ranging from billboards to radio spots at the same time however a growing number of companies are investing less money to strengthen their brands today most firms spend nearly twice as much on fastsale promotions than they spend on brand image advertising just 20 years ago those figures were reversed there has been a shortterm focus on quarterly profits said posner but establishing a brands image is not done in a quarter it takes careful methodical support this is not to say that ayer has always excelled at creating successful brand images for its clients during the past two years it lost such major clients as burger king and continental airlines which have struggled for years to develop clear brand images but ayer has seen some recent success in improving images for its huge retail client j c penney few companies have more carefully nurtured the brand image for a product than brownforman beverage co which makes jack daniels tennessee whiskey jack daniels has not strayed one iota from its folksy print campaign for the past 36 years that laidback image has been created through a longrunning series of blackandwhite print advertisements the ads are always informal photographs of people who work at the companys lone distillery in lynchburg tenn the only sign of the whiskey is a tiny picture of it buried at the bottom of each ad without a brand image you cant expect to have any longterm success said rick cahill senior brand manager for jack daniels i attribute all of the success of the brand to its image
