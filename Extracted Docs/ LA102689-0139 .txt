Three charities filed a $ 6-million suit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against United Way of Los Angeles and United Way of California , claiming they have been denied a fair chance to get payroll deduction donations from California 's state employees . The suit alleges that United Way used a pledge system that encourages contributions to United Way agencies , but which makes it difficult to donate to non-United Way charities . The suit , which also names the state as a defendant , was filed by Combined Health Appeal , International Services Agency and Environmental Federation of California . After the suit was filed , the plaintiffs sought and obtained from Superior Court Judge Miriam Vogel a temporary restraining order barring United Way of Los Angeles from distributing pledge cards to state employees without attaching designation cards which allow donors to give to non-United Way charities . A hearing for a preliminary injunction on the matter will be held Nov. 16 . United Way attorney Framroze Virjee said in court , `` I believe the campaign we 're running now is fair and in compliance with the law . '' Los Angeles United Way is in the midst of a $ 95-million fund-raising effort for its 350 human service and health agencies .
