PEUGEOT , the French car group , yesterday provided the latest evidence of continuing sluggish demand in the European car industry by indicating that sales last year were stagnant or slightly down on the FFr159.9bn ( Dollars 29.61bn ) recorded in 1990 . Mr Jacques Calvet , chairman of Peugeot , which also embraces Citroen , said the full-year net profits should be more than double the FFr2.27bn recorded in the first half , which was 54 per cent down on the same period of 1991 . Peugeot officials said they did not want to make a more precise estimate at this stage . However , this implies full-year profits of at least FFr4.54bn net , well down on FFr9.2bn in 1990 . This is within most analysts' expectations . ' I believe there is no reason not to be confident that the profit for the year will be more than double that of the first half , ' said Mr Calvet . Demand continued to flag in the UK and France , while the German market began to decline last year , said a Peugeot official .
