Former Federal Judge Walter L. Nixon Jr. left a halfway house today , after serving 20 months of a five-year prison term for perjury and 18 days after the Senate removed him from office . `` He was released on parole . He signed out at 8:15 a.m. , '' said Robert English , community corrections manager in New Orleans for the federal Bureau of Prisons . A federal jury convicted Nixon in 1986 of lying to a federal grand jury when he denied discussing a marijuana case with a district attorney . He began serving his prison term March 23 , 1988 , nearly two years after being sentenced . The Senate voted Nov. 3 to remove him from office , stripping him of his title of U.S. district judge and $ 89,500 salary .
