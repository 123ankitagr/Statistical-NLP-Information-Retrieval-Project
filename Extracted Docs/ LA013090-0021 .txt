It would be spectacular if Donald Trump actually does build the world 's tallest skyscraper on the Ambassador Hotel property ( Part A , Jan. 14 ) . At first I agreed with Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley that Trump 's proposed building would be inappropriate and out of scale for that area . But after thinking about it , it occurs to me that the Eiffel Tower is certainly `` out of scale '' in its Paris neighborhood ; the Empire State Building was `` out of scale '' when it was built more than a half century ago , and is n't that Tower in Pisa `` out of scale '' ? And were n't these buildings the object of scorn , ridicule and opposition when first proposed ? Yet , Paris , New York and Pisa just would n't be the same without them . The world 's tallest building would n't be just another office building ; it would be an attraction for the people of Los Angeles and tourists from around the world . That means far more tax dollars and jobs than another Arco twin-tower office complex which would contain the same number of square feet of office space . I believe that if Trump is serious , Los Angeles should encourage him to build our `` Eiffel Tower '' on Wilshire Boulevard . RICHARD N. JOSEPH Los Angeles
