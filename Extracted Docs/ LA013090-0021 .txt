it would be spectacular if donald trump actually does build the world's tallest skyscraper on the ambassador hotel property part a jan 14 at first i agreed with los angeles mayor tom bradley that trump's proposed building would be inappropriate and out of scale for that area but after thinking about it it occurs to me that the eiffel tower is certainly out of scale in its paris neighborhood the empire state building was out of scale when it was built more than a half century ago and isn't that tower in pisa out of scale and weren't these buildings the object of scorn ridicule and opposition when first proposed yet paris new york and pisa just wouldn't be the same without them the world's tallest building wouldn't be just another office building it would be an attraction for the people of los angeles and tourists from around the world that means far more tax dollars and jobs than another arco twin-tower office complex which would contain the same number of square feet of office space i believe that if trump is serious los angeles should encourage him to build our eiffel tower on wilshire boulevard richard n joseph los angeles
