NIPPON Trust Bank , a medium-sized Japanese trust bank , is to close its representative offices in New York and London later this year . It will be the first Japanese bank to fold its international network , a move which could prompt similar decisions by other banks . In sharp contrast to the Japanese banks ' aggressive international expansion of the late 1980s , they have refocused on their domestic market . The banks now favour business with established Japanese blue chip companies rather than overseas groups . While the banks are burdened with increasing bad loans caused by sharp falls in the Japanese stock and property markets , they have been slow to respond to hard times - unlike the Japanese brokers which have implemented rationalisation programmes . Leading brokers , such as Nomura and Daiwa , are reshuffling their overseas operations , while smaller houses , such as Takagi Securities and Kaisei Securities , have withdrawn from overseas operations .
