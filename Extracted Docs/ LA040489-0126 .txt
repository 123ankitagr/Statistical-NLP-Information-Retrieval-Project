Exxon crews today finished pumping the remaining crude oil out of the tanker Exxon Valdez in preparation for refloating and removing the source of North America 's worst-ever oil spill . Exxon said it had finished transferring 48 million gallons of crude from the Exxon Valdez to three other ships . About 25 million gallons of oily waste water remained aboard the ship , which spilled more than 10 million gallons of crude into Prince William Sound when it struck a reef March 24 . The company said crews will attempt to pump air into the hold and refloat the vessel off a reef at high tide Wednesday afternoon . If freed , the still-leaking ship , which has eight holes about 20 feet long in its hull , will be towed to a remote and already fouled cove for repairs .
