joe eimers has the face of a cherub and the knees of a war veteran you look at him with his large blue eyes round cheeks and tousled straight brown hair and you remember the triumphs and trials of being 15 years old but then you see his knees on his left knee there are four scars each nearly two inches long near his right knee is another scar this one more than six inches long and an inch wide the scars are a result of 11 knee operations in the last five years for eimers who first injured his knees and broke his leg in a bicycle accident when he was 9 still eimers runs on these knees every day as a member of the santa margarita high school junior varsity basketball team i was on my bike eimers said of the accident i live on a cul-de-sac and there was a camper on the corner i had to go out in the middle of the street to avoid it but there was a car coming down the street and it swerved and i swerved and i hit it the main problem in eimers case was his age said dr stephen bayley an orthopedic surgeon and director of the sports medicine clinic at pomona valley hospital because he was still growing the cartilage was in danger of healing with bone rather than cartilage so you have to go in and straighten it out bayley said and then it grows crooked again and you have to go in again undaunted eimers started playing basketball soon after the accident last year he went out for the freshman team at santa margarita at tryouts i noticed this kid limping said rich schaaf varsity coach at santa margarita it almost made me sick to look at his knees you can just see he's got to be in pain when he walks or runs but joe has this attitude of whatever anybody else does i'll do and he did everything the coaches asked of him as a freshman eimers scored one point on a team that finished 19-6 it was funny the way he scored jv coach john lester said it was the day before he went in for knee surgery in the last few seconds of the game another small boy danny donovan got fouled then threw joe the ball and ran down to the other end of the court the ref didn't know who got fouled gave joe the ball and he made his free throw eimers who is 5-feet-6 continues to work out to strengthen his knees and he remains upbeat after a surgery or two ago he said i just knew it was going to be better last fall he nearly became manager of the football team but then decided he wanted to play sports not just watch and the only sport he wanted to play was basketball i just went out for basketball because it looked like fun eimers said i like to play golf casually i watch football on tv but i like basketball i have no desire to play any other sport i play with friends around my neighborhood i can beat everybody except my next-door neighbor and i'm working on him eimers cannot straighten his right knee so he has changed his running style favoring his left foot turning his right foot inward to compensate and although it might look strange it works well for eimers it hurts after i've been running constantly but otherwise it's ok he said eimers scored his first three points of the season last weekend against valley christian the kids just went crazy schaaf said the whole crowd likes him schaaf said eimers cheerful never-say-die attitude has ensured his spot on the team i'll never forget about this time last year it was a monday his dad came in and said something had gone wrong and joe was going to have to have another operation schaaf said of course i figured that was the end of his high school basketball career but about a month and a half later i see joe in the weight room doing squats and then he went out for the team again i couldn't believe it santa margarita in only its third year of existence has five basketball teams varsity junior varsity sophomore and two freshman teams instead of keeping eimers on the sophomore team schaaf bumped him up to junior varsity this year joe's real smart schaaf said his handicap although i'm sure he doesn't consider it a handicap forces him to be smart nobody can tell him he's not considered a player like the other kids we need good attitudes as well as good players eimers said he was surprised and pleased at the promotion but all he really cares about is his team i didn't even know if i was going to be on the sophomore team but just before the season coach told me i was going to be on jv i was pretty stoked he said i just hope the team wins
