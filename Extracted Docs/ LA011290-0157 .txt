Joe Eimers has the face of a cherub and the knees of a war veteran . You look at him with his large blue eyes , round cheeks and tousled , straight brown hair and you remember the triumphs and trials of being 15 years old . But then you see his knees . On his left knee , there are four scars , each nearly two inches long . Near his right knee is another scar , this one more than six inches long and an inch wide . The scars are a result of 11 knee operations in the last five years for Eimers , who first injured his knees and broke his leg in a bicycle accident when he was 9 . Still , Eimers runs on these knees every day as a member of the Santa Margarita High School junior varsity basketball team . `` I was on my bike , '' Eimers said of the accident . `` I live on a cul-de-sac , and there was a camper on the corner . I had to go out in the middle of the street to avoid it , but there was a car coming down the street and it swerved , and I swerved , and I hit it . '' The main problem in Eimers ' case was his age , said Dr. Stephen Bayley , an orthopedic surgeon and director of the sports medicine clinic at Pomona Valley Hospital . Because he was still growing , the cartilage was in danger of healing with bone rather than cartilage . `` So you have to go in and straighten it out , '' Bayley said . `` And then it grows crooked again , and you have to go in again . '' Undaunted , Eimers started playing basketball soon after the accident . Last year , he went out for the freshman team at Santa Margarita . `` At tryouts , I noticed this kid , limping , '' said Rich Schaaf , varsity coach at Santa Margarita . `` It almost made me sick to look at his knees -- you can just see he 's got to be in pain when he walks or runs . `` But Joe has this attitude of 'whatever anybody else does , I 'll do , ' and he did everything ( the coaches ) asked of him . '' As a freshman , Eimers scored one point on a team that finished 19-6 . `` It was funny , the way he scored , '' JV Coach John Lester said . `` It was the day before he went in for knee surgery . In the last few seconds of the game , another small boy , Danny Donovan , got fouled , then threw Joe the ball and ran down to the other end of the court . `` The ref did n't know who got fouled , gave Joe the ball and he made his free throw . '' Eimers , who is 5-feet-6 , continues to work out to strengthen his knees . And he remains upbeat . `` After a surgery or two ago , '' he said , `` I just knew it was going to be better . '' Last fall , he nearly became manager of the football team , but then decided he wanted to play sports , not just watch . And the only sport he wanted to play was basketball . `` I just went out for basketball because it looked like fun , '' Eimers said . `` I like to play golf , casually . I watch football on TV , but I like basketball . I have no desire to play any other sport . `` I play with friends around my neighborhood -- I can beat everybody except my next-door neighbor , and I 'm working on him . '' Eimers can not straighten his right knee , so he has changed his running style , favoring his left foot , turning his right foot inward to compensate . And although it might look strange , it works well for Eimers . `` It hurts after I 've been running constantly but otherwise it 's OK , '' he said . Eimers scored his first three points of the season last weekend against Valley Christian . `` The kids just went crazy , '' Schaaf said . `` The whole crowd likes him . '' Schaaf said Eimers ' cheerful , never-say-die attitude has ensured his spot on the team . `` I 'll never forget , about this time last year -- it was a Monday -- his dad came in and said something had gone wrong , and Joe was going to have to have another operation , '' Schaaf said . `` Of course I figured that was the end of his high school basketball career . But about a month and a half later , I see Joe in the weight room , doing squats . And then he went out for the team again . I could n't believe it . '' Santa Margarita , in only its third year of existence , has five basketball teams : varsity , junior varsity , sophomore and two freshman teams . Instead of keeping Eimers on the sophomore team , Schaaf bumped him up to junior varsity this year . `` Joe 's real smart , '' Schaaf said . `` His handicap -- although I 'm sure he does n't consider it a handicap -- forces him to be smart . Nobody can tell him he 's not considered a player like the other kids -- we need good attitudes as well as good players . '' Eimers said he was surprised and pleased at the promotion , but all he really cares about is his team . `` I did n't even know if I was going to be on the sophomore team , but just before the season , Coach told me I was going to be on JV . I was pretty stoked , '' he said . `` I just hope the team wins . ''
