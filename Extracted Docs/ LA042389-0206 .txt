it is not often a brainstorm hits someone while he is watching television but it happened one night to william kaufman in december kaufman an employeebenefits consultant was viewing a segment of 2020 abcs weekly news magazine program the program dealt with 100 california lottery employees who donated more than 900 hours of their own vacation and overtime pay to a popular coworker suffering from aids it hit me like a bolt of lightning kaufman said if you could give time when somebody got sick why couldnt you give time and save it before anybody got sick that is when kaufman a woodmere long island pension and financialplanning consultant created the concept of an employee time bank such a bank would accrue time donated by employees in the form of unused vacation days or sick days personal time or overtime they would be converted to money the value of the employees time and then be given to coworkers who needed extra time off at full pay because of dire personal circumstances while the federal government and a few states such as california and arizona have initiated similar jobleave programs for public employees experts say that kaufmans time bank appears to be the nations first such employeebenefit program for the private sector it is an employee benefit whose time has come kaufman said there are so many catastrophic situations not covered by insurance he said these circumstances often involve chronic illnesses but also could include unforeseen personal problems such as painful divorces that require time off to reassemble fractured lives some experts say time banks might benefit employers as well such plans may reduce absenteeism by encouraging employees to donate unused sick days instead of taking them just because theyre entitled to said robert f morano a new york attorney specializing in business law common design shared kaufman added that time banks should appeal to businesses concerned with spiraling employee health insurance costs companies are looking for lowcost benefits that really deliver kaufman said time banks would require little additional cost for most companies kaufmans consulting fee for setting up such a bank ranges from $ 150 to $ 10 per employee depending on company size he said while kaufmans plans might differ from company to company his time banks share a common design first employees donate time to the bank overtime vacation days personal days unused sick days all according to individual preference and company policy it is all voluntary like giving to a blood bank but employees could donate one or two days a year or a few hours a month kaufman said next the company converts the value of the donated time to money in the bank prorating it according to each employees pay then a committee overseeing the time bank generally three employees and two managers reviews applications and decides which employees should get time off with pay an employee doesnt have to donate time to be eligible but thats a factor committees might consider kaufman said when a time bank is established an initial reserve can be built up and as time is used it can be replenished by periodic employee contributions still a time bank committee should be careful not to give out time too loosely kaufman said a committee can give time in small increments or can choose to give only partial salary payments if an employees financial need is not dire he said
