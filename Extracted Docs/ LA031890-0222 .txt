'' It 's not the norm to get pictures of this budget released , not to mention reviewed in the mainstream press , '' says Stephen Sayadian , director and co-writer of `` Dr . Caligari . '' Lots of movies are made for low budgets -- $ 750,000 in the case of `` Caligari '' -- but most go straight to video , if they are seen at all . The glut of big-budget Hollywood releases keeps most others out of the theaters . `` To get a 'Caligari ' out there and noticed in a world of ' K-9 ' and 'Turner and Hooch ' is an uphill battle all the way , '' Sayadian says . Sayadian made an earlier cult-movie splash with `` Cafe Flesh . '' That first success , he now admits , was largely an accident . This time , he knew how to connect with the midnight-movie crowd . The trick , he said , is to make a movie stand out . People who call `` Dr. Caligari '' non-commercial miss the point , according to Sayadian . `` That fact that it 's so off the wall is what makes it commercial . It actually , for a film of that budget , is quite commercial and quite visible . '' `` Rocky Horror Picture Show , '' still playing as a midnight movie almost 15 years after its release , has long since proved that there is an audience for films outside the Hollywood mainstream . `` People appreciate film makers who put themselves on the line , and they can sort of detect when they care about their work and they do n't go for the straight commercial hit , '' says Danny Peary , the New York-based author of a series of cult movie compendiums . Cult movies , says Peary , are `` different from the crowd . They break from the Hollywood assembly line , and audiences appreciate that . '' Peary 's definition of cult movies takes in everything from such studio releases as `` Harold and Maude '' or even `` It 's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World '' to offbeat low-budget offerings such as David Lynch 's `` Eraserhead '' and Sayadian 's own `` Cafe Flesh . '' `` These are the films people have emotional attachments to . They are word-of-mouth films , '' Peary says . `` People will not only see the films again and again , but they 'll bring new people with them . '' While it can be difficult to predict which movies will become cult favorites , Peary says many are controversial when released . `` It 's when there 's indifference that you realize there wo n't be a cult for the movie . '' `` Dr. Caligari , '' as it happens , can cite noble lineage in its quest for cult success . Peary 's nomination for the first cult movie ever is the original `` The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari , '' which played in one Paris theater for seven consecutive years . RICK VANDERKNYFF
