How dare Pete Rose insult us . How dare he stand before TV cameras , his stupid spiked hair sticking straight up , and evince no real remorse , take next to no responsibility for his actions and then , blithely and chillingly , say he hopes to be back in baseball posthaste . Having dishonored himself and his sport , all Pete Rose wanted to talk about was how soon he might be reinstated . Gall , thy name is Pete .
