the human blueprint by robert shapiro cassell pounds 16.99 432 pages the code of codes edited by dj kevles and l hood harvard pounds 23.95 396 pages one of the most important programmes of scientific research everdevised is under way in a massive cooperative effort in laboratories around the world it is the human genome project and it concerns nothing less than the nature of man in his entertainingly clear account robert shapiro explains what it is and explores the exciting and sometimes alarming possibilities it offers genome research is the province of that department of biological science called genetics genetics is the investigation of how organisms bequeath anatomical physiological and behavioural traits to their offspring and how such traits express themselves in the formation and development of individual organisms central to this inquiry is the concept of the gene a chemical packet of information which is the fundamental unit of heredity the word gene was coined in 1909, but the idea dates back to the work of the 19 th century monk gregor mendel who studied heredity in sweet peas and proposed a mechanism by which characteristics are passed between generations little more than a century has elapsed since mendel's day but genetics has proved to be one of the most important sciences in history the sum of all genetic material in a given organism is called the genome it is a hugely complex chemical storehouse of information a code or script in which is written the secrets of every physical aspect of a living creature the quantity of information in a single human genome is equivalent to the amount of data in a thousand telephone directories each a thousand pages long when scientists can read the code they will have information about an individual's genetic make-up which will reveal not only his heredity for example which forebears bequeathed him his height colouring and other traits but something of his fate also for example the diseases he has or might be prone to and the possibility of his offspring inheriting these or those characteristics and conditions genetics has already explained much and made many things possible especially in medicine where it has proved itself a powerful tool transplant surgery prenatal diagnosis cancer treatments the manufacture of insulin for treatment of diabetics all would be impossible without genetics genetics is crucial in cystic fibrosis research and the attempt to understand alzheimer's disease but these advances are based on limited and partial knowledge of the human genome which until recently presented too large a task for more than piecemeal investigation thanks to brilliant recent discoveries about how to read the genetic code together with the bold imagination and resolve of scientists prepared to work together on a long-term international project the limits on scientific understanding of the genome are being pushed back at a meeting in san diego california in october 1989, the human genome project was launched scheduled to take 15 years and promised dollars 3 bn by the us government over that period with the right techniques established and high-powered computer technology available there is excitement among the researchers what has been described as the holy grail of human genetics is close at hand james watson one of the discoverers of dna and the genome project's head has said a more important set of instruction books will never be found by human beings when finally interpreted the genetic messages encoded within our dna will provide the ultimate answers to the chemical underpinnings of human existence shapiro takes us through the detective story of how genetics developed and lucidly explains the nature of the genome and the task of investigating it in the collection of essays edited by kevles and hood the same terrain is covered but more technically both books make admirable and successful efforts to equip general readers with a clear grasp of the issues an important matter because the future of genome research prompts a number of difficult questions this is illustrated by both books when they turn from explanation of the genome project to the consequences of its successful completion armed with so much genetic knowledge will we be tempted to manipulate the genetic material of future people not just to exclude hereditary diseases but to make them taller more intelligent more athletic should employers know the genetic profile of potential employees some of whom they might refuse to employ because they have say a genetic risk of early death from heart disease what policies should we adopt now to cope with the taxing choices we shall soon have to make now that all this knowledge is rushing upon us shapiro and the contributors to the kevles and hood volume issue us with an invitation to reflect on these questions while there is still time
