Inglewood Mayor Edward Vincent has decided against filing charges of assault and battery against a security guard with whom the mayor had a confrontation two weeks ago at a Hawthorne car dealership , officials said Thursday . Vincent had filed an assault and battery complaint last week with Hawthorne police alleging that the guard , Arthur Chamberland , hit him with a flashlight . The incident took place when Vincent and another man tried to enter Prince Pontiac on Imperial Highway after hours . The mayor said he was looking for money he had misplaced in a car . Chamberland 's supervisors had praised his actions and said Chamberland was injured when his hand was pinned in a door . Both sides agreed this week to drop the matter .
