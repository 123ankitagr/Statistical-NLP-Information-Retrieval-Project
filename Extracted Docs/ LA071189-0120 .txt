a decade ago rick white wrote a master's thesis on the business of baseball today he is one of baseball's most successful businessmen for four years the former southern californian has presided over soaring sales of official baseball memorabilia everything from traditional caps pennants and baseball cards to more exotic orange orioles beaks and angels air mattresses white is president of major league baseball properties which licenses souvenirs and apparel bearing major league team insignia the former chapman college student returned to orange county on friday for an annual convention of 350 memorabilia makers culminating with today's all-star game at anaheim stadium according to sports business observers and competitors white deserves much of the credit for transforming the memorabilia business from a marginal operation to a major source of revenue and improving major league baseball's financial fortunes in the process there's been phenomenal growth in the sale of baseball souvenirs and rick white has been the main reason said brent diamond publisher and editor of team licensing magazine which monitors sale of paraphernalia sponsored by professional sports teams he's the marketing force that's driven almost all of their recent success major league baseball turned a profit for the first time in decades in 1986 and has remained in the black ever since from 1986 to 1988, league attendance jumped 11.5 and radio and television revenue increased 33.5 but the gains in attendance and broadcast revenues are dwarfed by growth in sales of official baseball merchandise in 1986, retail sales of major league licensed goods totaled 225 million the figure soared to 700 million in 1988 and is expected to top 1 billion this year major league baseball including the 26 teams and the commissioner's office gets about 4 of that total and then divides it based on an undisclosed formula this year's expanded sales put baseball ahead of the national football league which has long dominated the memorabilia market according to white frank vuono senior director of licensing for the nfl said it is unclear whether major league baseball is now the leader the nfl declines to disclose its souvenir royalty revenue that sort of thing is hard to measure and we don't release any figures said vuono but rick has done a tremendous job in centralizing and developing their business and most retailers say we're about even white 36, began his career with major league baseball after completing a regression analysis of baseball salaries for his master's thesis at purdue university we figured out that hank aaron should earn the most and he did said white who had been an all-star catcher at la mirada high school and student body president at chapman college in orange sometimes you have to prove the obvious after a short stint as a public relations officer for baseball's umbrella organization and then as an assistant branch manager with carnation co white went back to work for major league baseball in 1979 he was assigned to major league promotions the forerunner of major league baseball properties things were somewhat sloppily run then said white commissions varied radically and the league the teams and everybody else marketed the goods then baseball commissioner bowie kuhn didn't want to clog up the game with a lot of commercialism when peter ueberroth took over as commissioner in 1984, however things changed under pressure from both players and owners ueberroth centralized souvenir sales within major league baseball paraphernalia sales had been paired with an unprofitable media operation which was spun off as phoenix communications in 1985 a former time inc executive charlie bear was hired as a consultant for the new souvenir sales group and an overall marketing plan was adopted we found the money teams were making on memorabilia even after a world series wouldn't even pay for a utility infielder white said peter allowed us to make a change he didn't tell us how to do anything but said we had to create some sort of strategy bear and white worked together to forge a marketing plan which was designed to follow the nfl strategy of centralized sales publicity and trademark enforcement they got a late start and learned from the nfl's mistakes said diamond at team licensing magazine they've seen by far the most growth largely because rick put together a good marketing program under the new plan major league baseball assumed responsibility for stopping counterfeit goods when the program began back in 1986, shipments of unlicensed foreign-made baseball products were turned back at the borders and retailers were assured that they would not be undersold by makers of inferior products who cut separate deals with team owners around the same time major league baseball also dumped 25 of its former licensees and began seeking more established producers in the last 2 1 2 years the organization has spent more than 6 million to police and prosecute counterfeiters we want to establish ourselves as an upper-end producer white said so we are opening our own stores and are working with major department stores as part of that move the league last year began sponsoring the diamond collection of authentic major league style apparel and the cooperstown collection of historically accurate uniforms last year the league opened five major league souvenir and apparel stores in san diego oakland new york pittsburgh and milwaukee it plans to open two more by the end of 1989 one in brea and one in boston the stores sell parkas towels sheets and even wallpaper as well as more traditional items in the future white said major league baseball properties will begin more joint ventures with players and increased marketing of such collectibles as baseball cards and old jerseys asked if anything could dampen demand for major league-sponsored goods white mentioned counterfeiting over-saturation of the market and of course a players strike we don't play baseball we don't make money he said it's that simple
