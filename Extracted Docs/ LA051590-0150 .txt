Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu said today that he will apologize for Japan 's wartime aggression when he meets South Korea 's president next week , but the government is less willing to have the emperor make a similar statement . `` I think I should express frank regret about our mistakes in the past and apologize for them , '' Kaifu told Parliament . He was responding to an opposition question about news reports that South Korean President Roh Tae Woo expects an apology from Emperor Akihito during the president 's three-day trip to Japan , which begins May 24 . Japan ruled Korea as a colony from 1910 to 1945 , and Koreans have bitter memories of harsh treatment under the Japanese , along with the legacy of their country 's division since the war 's end . Leaders of Japan 's governing Liberal Democratic Party expressed strong opposition to a royal apology .
