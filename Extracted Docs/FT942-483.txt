Two Oxford University colleges yesterday voted to change their names in honour of prominent benefactors . Manchester College , which does not yet have full collegiate status within the university , is to be The Manchester Academy and Harris College , in recognition of support from Sir Philip Harris , former chairman of Harris Queensway . Rewley House , which caters for mature and part-time students , becomes Kellogg College in recognition of donations from the WK Kellogg Foundation , a US charitable body .
