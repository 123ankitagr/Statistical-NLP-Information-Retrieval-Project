israel plans to open its first liaison office in beijing this week as a diplomatic beachhead ending decades of estrangement with china which traditionally has supported israels enemies the office operated by the israel academy of sciences and humanities at a foreignmanaged hotel in downtown beijing will technically serve as a clearinghouse for academic exchange between the two countries and will not have official government status israel and china have no diplomatic relations and are unlikely to establish official ties in the foreseeable future beijing maintains strong political and military ties with arab nations and has steadfastly supported the palestinian cause yet the liaison office staffed by two israeli science academy experts represents a watershed in a relationship that has been developing quietly in recent years chinas immediate interest is obtaining trade and technology from israel
