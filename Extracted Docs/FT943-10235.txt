The solicitor for a City broker accused of unfairly dismissing a woman broker who is also claiming sexual discrimination , yesterday admitted that the company was wrong not to give her a written explanation of the allegations made against her . Mr Philip Parish , representing Willis Corroon , told an industrial tribunal in Croydon , south London , that the company should have told Miss Samantha Phillips , an aviation broker , that the meeting at which she was suspended was a disciplinary hearing . The company should also have given her a right of appeal . Miss Phillips has claimed she was dismissed because she rebuffed the advances of Mr Giles Wilkinson , head of production at Willis Corroon . He allegedly interrupted a business trip in 1992 to join her in Denmark . Mr Jeremy Flaxman , a senior manager at Willis Corroon , said Miss Phillips was 'prone to sensitivity on a number of issues ' . He said he did not believe that Miss Phillips ' complaints about Mr Wilkinson amounted to sexual harassment . Mr Wilkinson has denied her allegations . The company sacked Miss Phillips in 1992 for gross misconduct . Mr Flaxman said Miss Phillips was fired because she allegedly lied to LA Hudson , the underwriter , about insurance cover that her company was seeking to set up for another client . Mr Flaxman said : ' I felt her refusal to admit that she had lied meant we were losing total confidence in her integrity . ' Mr Paul Rogers , former Willis Corroon divisional director , said Miss Phillips 'had a number of problems in so far as time keeping , attitude to work , and unwillingness to carry out instructions in the fashion I would have like her to ' . He added : ' I 've never heard any suggestive remark made by Giles Wilkinson . ' Miss Phillips has claimed that Mr Wilkinson persecuted her and referred to her as a 'bimbo ' in front of colleagues at a high-level meeting . The hearing continues on Wednesday .
