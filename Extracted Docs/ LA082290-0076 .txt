the future begins now for the st louis cardinals as far as manager joe torre is concerned the cardinals have eight potential free agents and torre will be exploring a number of options and sitting down highpriced veterans as the season winds down we may see a mass exodus here torre said tuesday i knew that coming in but if all the main players decide to walk at least we got a peek instead of waiting till spring training to see what they can do the first move was calling up outfielder ray lankford from triple a louisville monday to replace injured pedro guerrero lankford will play regularly in center field moving willie mcgee one of the potential free agents to right field for the first time in his professional career lankford 23 was hitting 261 with 10 home runs 72 rbis and 28 stolen bases in his first season in triple a lankford who got his first start tuesday night has often been mentioned as the likely successor to mcgee who has played for cardinals since 1982 we want to get a good read on what we can expect from him torre said the only way to do that is to really throw him out there mcgee is second in the national league in batting with a 339 average but has made a careerhigh 16 errors in center field a few weeks ago he flung his glove into the stands after dropping a fly ball torre expects mcgee to make the adjustment to right hes a good athlete and he shouldnt have much problem torre said while guerrero is on the 15day disabled list with a lower back injury torre also is moving rookie catcher todd zeile to first base and giving backup catcher tom pagnozzi a chance to play regularly i talked to todd zeile we know hes a catcher im very impressed with his catching torre said he seems to need a little more work with the receiving and the throwing but its smooth pagnozzi a backup the past four seasons is hitting 266 the odd man out is milt thompson who has recently pulled out of a seasonlong slump
