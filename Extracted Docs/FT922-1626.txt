the french car industry is emerging from recession stronger and more competitive than before it still has some way to go before it can match japanese levels of productivity the ultimate target in the minds of the managements of both peugeot and state-owned renault yet the strides they have made are enormous a decade ago peugeot and state-owned renault were on the brink of bankruptcy now they are in relatively good health in spite of having suffered a two-year decline in their main european markets last year for example peugeot maintains it produced the highest net margins of any car maker in the world even after having suffered a 40 per cent decline in net earnings mr jacques calvet the group's chairman reckons the market will pick up this year renault once one of the public sector's heaviest loss makers reported well over doubled net profits last year and is proceeding so successfully with its alliance with volvo that both partners talk of a possible merger like their international competitors french car makers have had to make heavy workforce reductions down by 25 per cent over the past five years at renault and down by 5 per cent over the same period at peugeot which was less overmanned than its public sector rival much more is to come according to a recent study by the planning commission which estimates that the french car industry must trim its workforce by another 2.5 per cent annually until the end of the decade to become fully competitive peugeot and renault have also overhauled factory organisation introduced just-in-time stock control japanese-style production teams reorganised their design departments and more at renault than peugeot modernised their product ranges peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per cent over the past five years while renault says it has improved its productivity by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per year over the same period both aim at least to repeat that improvement by the end of the decade this leaves french car industry's productivity just 10 per cent behind that of japanese car producers in britain itself 10 per cent behind the japanese in japan according to a study by consultants mckinsey for the european commission french car production has also become more efficient the average renault plant is now fully operational 70 per cent of the time while peugeot renault even manages 75 per cent a big improvement over recent years but still behind the 85 per cent in japan of course getting this far has not been easy and there are still handicaps to be overcome for example renault and peugeot both invested heavily in automated production lines in the mid-1980s yet they have since had to retreat slightly re-introducing more labour and simpler machines to the shopfloor because the robots proved complicated to maintain and sometimes unreliable tighter stock control has saved financial charges for both of them yet the extent to which just-in-time stock control depends on japanese style labour stability was sharply underlined by a strike at renault's main engine and gearbox plant which took just 10 days to bring the group's entire french and belgian car production to a halt the other big shortcoming they have yet to tackle is an ageing and relatively untrained workforce the average age of workers at one of renault's main plants at flins near paris is 45 as against 28 at nissan uk according to the planning commission study in 1989, nearly half of french the car industry's workforce had no professional diploma renault is accordingly pushing for european community and government aid for retraining there has however been measurable progress in several areas quality control peugeot has abandoned the old style of quality control whereby faults are identified and corrected in an enormous car park at the end of the production line now the lines are divided into sections each managed by an autonomous team which is responsible for correcting its own faults as the unfinished car passes through as a result peugeot has over the past five years closed all its refinishing shops renault is moving over to the same system and aims to close all its refinishing departments within four years components renault and peugeot are getting less integrated and becoming primarily designers and assemblers this is another way of cutting costs to the bone but also reflects the fact that neither wants to become involved in the increasing electronic and specialised componentry found in modern cars such as anti-lock brakes or catalytic converters this leaves their hands free to concentrate on key mechanical components such as automatic gearboxes where the pair are considering joint production accordingly the proportion of bought-in components has risen steeply in recent years to just over 60 per cent of operating total costs at peugeot and 67 per cent at renault they have both been selling some of their component businesses or seeking export partners as in renault's disposal of a stake in its steering systems subsidiary to a power steering offshoot of toyota renault has now told its component buyers to put in house and external suppliers on exactly the same footing when deciding where to buy if they have become more dependent on outside component producers france's car makers have also been applying more pressure to keep suppliers up to the mark peugeot and renault have for the past five years been running joint audits on component suppliers quality grading them according to ability to do their own quality control and at the same time reducing the number of suppliers with which they do business directly they are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers productivity and costs too meanwhile renault says it has achieved substantial costs savings by pooling much of its component buying activities with volvo design management another part of the race to catch up with japan is the time and investment taken to design and launch new cars here peugeot estimates that the japanese still have a substantial advance capable of launching a new model for around ffr3-4bn in three years as against the french average of ffr6bn to ffr8bn in four to five years these comparisons are of course rough since there is no standard measure for the starting point of a new design nevertheless renault and peugeot reckon they are catching up both companies have in the past three years started setting up project teams so that all departments involved in a new car launch work together simultaneously formerly new cars were designed by a production line-type organisation with the blueprint passing from the design department through engineering and production management the time taken to design and launch renault's soon to be unveiled small car code-named the x06 was in line with japanese experience says mr philippe gras deputy chief executive on average renault aims to produce a new model in just under four years down from the previous norm of nearly five years peugeot last year placed the design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results from 1994 the french car industry's progress invites the question of whether peugeot's continued calls for protection against japanese competition not incidentally echoed by renault should be taken seriously last summer's ec-japan car import agreement allows the community to set controls on japanese car sales until the end of the decade so what can there be to fear peugeot's answer is clear japanese cars should not be allowed free access to the ec until tokyo allows the europeans the same market share in japan as the japanese have in europe as mr calvet argued in a recent article in the ft the deal was an example of how europe has unilaterally disarmed without anything in exchange the next few years will show whether mr calvet and his colleagues can create the weapons to fight back
