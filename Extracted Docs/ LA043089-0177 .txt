the united states national soccer team is likely to be without both its most experienced player rick davis and its most creative player hugo perez when it plays costa rica in a vital world cup qualifying match today at st louis davis who has been the backbone of the us team for more than a decade is questionable because of an injury and perez arguably the most inventive and technically skilled of the american players is definitely sidelined with one that leaves coach bob gansler with a problem having lost the first of its eight qualifying games 10 to costa rica in costa rica on april 16 the us team is faced with a virtual mustwin situation today if it is to avoid falling further behind in the fiveteam qualifying group each of the five teams plays a homeandhome series against the other four two points are awarded for a win one for a tie and none for a loss the top two teams in the final standings will advance to next years world cup in italy costa rica leads the standings with four points after two wins and a loss guatemala is second with two points after splitting its series with costa rica the united states has no points after one loss the two other teams in the group el salvador and trinidad tobago have yet to play the americans controlled much of the play at san jose two weeks ago but were unable to overcome a slow start during which they allowed costa rica to take the lead in the 14th minute with a crowd of 26271 including costa rican president oscar arias cheering them on the costa rican players hung on for the victory we came out tentative and lackadaisical in the first half gansler told soccer america magazine it picked up in the second half but we didnt create enough scoring chances for ourselves whether it was the sun the crowd the wrong breakfast whatever we just played too slowly davis and perez missed the first game too and their absence showed without davis stabilizing influence in the midfield and defense the united states at times appeared shaky under pressure on attack meanwhile it missed the skills that perez brings to the game tab ramos was impressive but the americans would have posed a greater threat had he been able to team with perez gansler who has been criticized for playing perez in the marlboro cup games at miami before he had fully recovered recognized the need for more creativity on offense we were setting up well he said of the game in san jose but either the pass wouldnt come or our movement off the ball was nonexistent our players were not creating the great passing angle so we could play behind their players we needed to go forward with more urgency the united states is likely to do that today at st louis soccer park in suburban fenton mo the 8500seat stadium has been sold out for the game which will be televised live on espn at 1 pm pdt were capable of playing better than we did gansler said well be ready for them in st louis after todays match the us team heads west to begin preparing for its may 13 qualifying match against trinidad tobago at el camino college in torrance
