in the continuing flap over george cunninghams animal attraction del olmo criticizes the lack of minority and particularly latino students and faculty in prestigious film schools he suggests that had there been a minority adviser guiding cunningham that the film might be more sensitive to latinos as a latino and a film student at ucla i support animal attraction because it has something to say not only about american perception and exploitation of countries such as mexico but also about minority hypersensitivity at a preliminary screening last year a latina protester demanded that the film be burned censorship is a dangerous business whether it be the destruction of a work or the prevention of its creation minority faculty wont necessarily make for more sensitive student films because at ucla students have final say as to the content of their work as a latino film maker i would have it no other way nino rodriguez los angeles
