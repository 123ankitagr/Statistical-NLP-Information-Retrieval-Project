In the continuing flap over George Cunningham 's `` Animal Attraction , '' Del Olmo criticizes the lack of minority , and particularly Latino , students and faculty in prestigious film schools . He suggests that had there been a minority adviser guiding Cunningham , that the film might be more sensitive to Latinos . As a Latino and a film student at UCLA , I support `` Animal Attraction '' because it has something to say not only about American perception and exploitation of countries such as Mexico , but also about minority hypersensitivity . At a preliminary screening last year , a Latina protester demanded that the film be burned . Censorship is a dangerous business , whether it be the destruction of a work or the prevention of its creation . Minority faculty wo n't necessarily make for more `` sensitive '' student films because at UCLA students have final say as to the content of their work . As a Latino film maker , I would have it no other way . NINO RODRIGUEZ Los Angeles
