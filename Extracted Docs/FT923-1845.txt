Sir , Re Peter Knight 's article on CFCs ( Business and the Environment , September 2 ) , there seems to me to be absolutely no point in developing new , greener refrigeration technology alone . How can I , as a conscientious consumer , dispose of my old refrigerator and buy a new one knowing that it is only when refrigerators are crushed or broken up that they become an environmental hazard . Without an old-for-new exchange scheme and extensive re-cycling programmes the world is a safer place if I stick to my old refrigerator for as long as possible . I have the same problem with aerosols . I have 20 or so in a box in the garage which I am unable to dispose of safely in Italy . They all contain CFCs . What can a thoughtful consumer do ; ring Friends of the Earth ? I rang London and Rome and they could give me no answer . Why is there this huge oversight ?
