The Hawthorne City Council has unanimously selected Public Works Director James H. Mitsch to replace retiring City Manager R. Kenneth Jue . Mitsch , who will take over the position when Jue leaves his post Dec. 31 , 1990 , was chosen , as expected , at the council 's Monday night meeting . Mitsch , 51 , came to Hawthorne in 1966 as assistant city engineer and has held several positions at City Hall , including that of acting city manager for almost a year in 1971 . City officials call Mitsch a highly qualified replacement who understands the city 's inner workings . Jue , 57 , who has been with the city for 24 years , notified the council three weeks ago that he wanted to retire while he is young enough to enjoy some of his favorite pastimes , such as woodcraft and motorcycle riding . Jue became city manager in 1977 after being city engineer for 11 years . Before that , he served 13 years as assistant engineer with the city of Inglewood .
