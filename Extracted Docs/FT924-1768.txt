THE GERMAN alcohol monopoly flies in the face of the European single market and must end , according to the Alcohol Free Trade Association . The two-year-old association , which represents two-thirds of European Community alcohol production , expects the European Commission to publish its regulations in the next couple of weeks . It is hoping for a so-called light regime , similar to that announced last month for potatoes . The AFTA has already complained to the commission that the 70-year-old German monopoly 's pricing policy amounts to an abuse of a dominant position and is contrary to the Treaty of Rome . 'Thousands of wealthy land owners operate their own distilleries and enjoy the privilege of selling their produce to the State at artificially high prices , ' the association said . German subsidies have reached DM343m ( Pounds 140m ) on the production of 100m litres of alcohol a year - the same amount that two modern distilleries can produce in the Netherlands at a cost of about DM1 a litre , said Mr Max Jansen , AFTA president . The market price is about DM1.10 . 'In Germany this is a cottage industry . Alcohol production is just an addition to the farm , ' said Mr Jansen . Germany should consider providing direct aid to its farmers rather than encouraging unprofitable production and surpluses . EC alcohol production ( excluding wine alcohol ) is about 1.4bn litres , with 60 per cent derived from agricultural production and 40 per cent from oil-based ethylene . About one-third of production is used by the drinks industry for gin , vodka and liqueurs . Most of the remainder goes to the cosmetics , perfume , pharmaceuticals and ink industries .
