sales of new cars in august showed very clearly that there is no underlying recovery in demand according to professor garel rhys professor of motor industry economics at cardiff business school it would be a very brave man who forecast any significant recovery before the last quarter of 1993, he said uk new car sales peaked at 2.3 m in 1989, but prof rhys warned that sales were unlikely to reach even 2 m before 1995 the motor industry had hoped that august would mark the end of the three-year decline in demand for new cars but sales rose by only 1.7 per cent compared with august last year the month traditionally accounts for between a fifth and a quarter of annual new car sales because of the change of registration prefix ford the uk market leader for new cars expects sales in the whole of 1992 to total only 1.55 m a 2.5 per cent decline from 1.59 m last year figures from the society of motor manufacturers and traders show that new car sales in the first eight months of the year at 1,175,600 were 2.5 per cent lower than in the same period a year ago registrations have fallen by 32.7 per cent in the past three years the steepest decline in the post-war period sir hal miller the society's chief executive said that a change in public perception of the prospects for the uk economy is the only remedy for a recovery both ford and rover are being forced to cut output on several of their uk assembly lines because of weaker-than-expected demand in the uk and in export markets new commercial vehicle registrations in august rose by 9.5 per cent to 31,704 the increase was however from a disastrous base sir hal said in the first eight months of the year new commercial vehicle sales at 142,098 were 6 per cent lower than a year before sales have fallen by 46.5 per cent in the last three years rover a subsidiary of british aerospace lost further ground in august with a 10.2 per cent fall in sales volume and was ousted from third place by the peugeot group which includes citroen rover's market share last month declined to only 11.1 per cent from 12.6 per cent a year before while the peugeot group boosted its share to 12.9 per cent from 11.7 per cent rover still remains narrowly ahead of the peugeot group for the first eight months however with a share of 12.3 per cent down from 14.4 per cent a year ago compared with the 12.1 per cent captured by the french carmaker citroen made the biggest gains last month among the volume carmakers with a 25.7 per cent jump in sales compared with the 1.7 per cent rise in the overall market both the peugeot group and renault have made significant gains this year with renault's sales volume rising by 18.9 per cent in the first 8 months ford the uk market leader halted the erosion of its market share in august with a 9.9 per cent jump in sales volume volkswagen which was involved in heavy price-cutting a year ago was another casualty last month it suffered a 28 per cent drop in sales which it blamed on a
