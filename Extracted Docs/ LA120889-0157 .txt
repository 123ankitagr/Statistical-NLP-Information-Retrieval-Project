it is hard to say which southern california institution is the most scandalously bankrupt lincoln savings or hollywood heavy metal the pages of photo ads in the pulp music magazines that chronicle the la hard rock scene tell a story of creative and imaginative collapse that would be hilarious if it werent so sad band after band appears in one of two ritual guises the frowning leatherclad toughguy clones of guns n roses and the fluffyhaired prettified fops made up in poisons pouting image it is a vision of rock as a beauty pageant or a game of followtheleader in which riches and fame await those who can best embody some precast standard of outrageousness and rebelliousness in a world where walking cussing cliches like warrant this years prize la metal spawn can sell a million albums the inducements to run from individuality are obvious the big f is one los angeles hard rock band that has turned its back on the fashion sweepstakes from the start said rob donin the power trios drummer the big f decided that it would stay clear of the los angeles hard rock scene and its cliches we dont hang out in the hollywood clubs and were not trying to get in with the sunset scene said donin whose band opens for soundgarden tonight at the marquee in westminster it seems there are a few bands out there that are really sincere and 2 million others jumping on the bandwagon with this instantaneous toughness to me thats not rock n roll its a hollywood fabrication we didnt want to be a typical rock poseur band there had to be some substance there instead of making the hollywood scene donin singerbassist john shreve and guitarist mark christian spent most of the past three years in their tiny rehearsal room in north hollywood coming up with the darkvisioned hard rock songs that appear on their debut album the big f is not a work of striking originality the echoes of such power rock precursors as led zeppelin jimi hendrix and to a lesser extent aerosmith are much too obvious for that but the band does pack a good deal of emotional force into its collection of melodic hardriffing rockers if shreves wailing vocal style owes a big debt to led zeppelins robert plant it also carries a raw allout immediacy that makes the big fs songs sound like intensely felt statements rather than studied zeppelin tributes the bands adopted emblem a grotesquely phallic scene from a painting by hieronymous bosch tells a good deal about its thematic slant the big fs ambiguous symbolladen songs frequently depict forces of control ranging from religion to drugs to fashion clashing with a fierce sometimes threatening sexual energy while the hollywood metal crowd treats sex as a commercial comeon the big f seems serious about delving into sexuality as a source of mystery and power there are emotional elements within the three of us that we like to purge through the music donin said in a recent phone interview from a tour stop in phoenix theres a lot of frustration and anguish that comes out we dont repress things there is a violent element within all of us you repress that and in my opinion thats when you have these nut cases going around killing people they repress until it blows up that letitout philosophy also applies to how the band has operated internally donin said the casual observer would think this band is ready to fall apart because of its members penchant for arguing creative issues aggressively its those instances when we are really angry at each other that things come out great each of us wants to be a dictator and i think thats healthy as a result you get a constant clash and what comes out of it is pretty powerful stuff donin said that he shreve and christian all in their mid20s formed the big f he said the initial has no set meaning after running across each other in separate los angeles bands the band made no effort to build a local following playing only a few dates last spring to which its manager invited record label scouts the big f had expected to release its first album on its own but elektra records offered a deal that donin said gave the band the full artistic control it was seeking while a namebrand producer is usually considered a prerequisite for a hard rock release on a major label the big fs members produced their album themselves other labels that suggested stuff like that bringing in a producer were immediately dismissed donin said there are very few labels other than elektra that would accept 100 creative control one consequence of not having cultivated a following on the hollywood scene is that the big f is emerging as a completely unknown band with no base of fan support i dont know what our following is at this point donin said i dont know if the big f is an alternative band it certainly isnt in my mind a heavy metal band extensive touring right now is going to find the audience because i dont know where it is right now there is definitely an audience out there for this we have yet to clash with each other the big f soundgarden and skin tight play tonight at 8 at the marquee 7000 garden grove blvd westminster tickets $ 10 information 714 8911181
