THE Australian government should resist calls from manufacturers and others for a slow-down in the pace of tariff reductions , according to a report on Australia 's trade with north-east Asia , writes Kevin Brown in Sydney . The report , by the Foreign Affairs Department 's East Asia Analytical Unit , says attempts to protect domestic industries through protection and government intervention would damage Australia 's trade prospects . The report is an update of a 1989 study by Professor Ross Garnaut which provided much of the justification for government plans to reduce tariffs to negligible levels by early next century . It says north-east Asia - especially Japan , China , Korea , Taiwan and Hong Kong - is crucial to Australia 's future economic performance . The region already takes 40 per cent of Australia 's merchandise exports , and provides 20 per cent of investment . The region will continue to grow faster than most parts of the world , and the report warns that Australia needs to stay abreast of important changes , including the movement of manufacturing operations to lower-cost countries . The report rejects the argument that countries in the region have benefited from intervention by governments in selected industrial sectors .
