Writer Tom Clancy , whose best-selling thrillers have made him the author laureate of the defense community , reportedly has sold his next novel for more than $ 10 million , perhaps the most ever for a single book . The Baltimore-born author , reached at his home in Calvert County , Md. , would not confirm the figure but referred to it alternately as `` this absurd amount of money '' and `` really , really nice . '' His agent was less understated : `` This is the deal of the century , '' said Robert Gottlieb of the William Morris agency . Recent published reports say that other houses have been wooing Clancy with offers of more than $ 10 million for the book , Clancy 's sixth , leading insiders to speculate that Putnam-Berkley got him by agreeing to an amount in excess of that . Gottlieb hinted that the signing price was greater than other recent deals , such as the more than $ 30 million Stephen King reportedly received for his next four books and Jean Auel 's rumored $ 25 million to $ 30 million for three books . With the big money , though , comes big expectations , Clancy said . `` You have to create a -- what is the figure they 're saying -- $ 10-million book , '' Clancy said . `` There is a certain degree of pressure that attaches itself . '' The book is due March 1 , 1991 , Clancy said . Putnam expects to have it on the shelves by that summer . `` I 'm at the fiddling around stage , '' Clancy said . `` I have my own way of working . I work into it gradually , then the last two , three months , I work frantically . '' The untitled book will continue the adventures of CIA operative Jack Ryan , doing `` the usual , trying to keep the world safe , '' he said . Astonishingly enough , Clancy published his first book , `` The Hunt for Red October , '' a mere six years ago . And for a mere $ 5,000 paid by the tiny , Annapolis , Md.-based Naval Institute Press . That book , recently made into the current hit movie , is No . 1 on The New York Times paperback best-seller list . His most recent book , `` Clear and Present Danger , '' was the top seller last year at 1.6 million copies .
