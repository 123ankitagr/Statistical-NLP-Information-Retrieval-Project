men have needed neckties for a long time particularly since the 19th-century reforms that left men's clothing utterly plain in the tie barron's 21.95 160 pp sarah gibbings tells the history in considerable detail how the ribbons that tied the 18th-century pigtail became the bow tie how the working-class and american bandanna turned into the modern four-in-hand and how the riverboat gambler's string tie was originally associated with lord byron who never actually wore a necktie it's interesting to note how the modern necktie often scorned as excruciatingly formal originated as a rakish ornament of pugilists and horse-and-carriage hot-rodders turn-of-the century female cyclists wore neckties gibbings speculates to make them honorary men in other words to indicate that they were not outdoors for disreputable purposes there's occasionally more detail than many people will want here as in the technical discussion of the resilient lining technique used in nearly all modern ties and exactly how pierre cardin licenses his designs but this book offers more than neckwear for thought in its own way it's a light on history charles perry
