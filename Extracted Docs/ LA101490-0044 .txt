Men have needed neckties for a long time , particularly since the 19th-Century reforms that left men 's clothing utterly plain . In The Tie ( Barron 's : $ 21.95 ; 160 pp . ) , Sarah Gibbings tells the history in considerable detail : how the ribbons that tied the 18th-Century pigtail became the bow tie , how the working-class ( and American ) bandanna turned into the modern four-in-hand , and how the riverboat gambler 's string tie was originally associated with Lord Byron , who never actually wore a necktie . It 's interesting to note how the modern necktie , often scorned as excruciatingly formal , originated as a rakish ornament of pugilists and horse-and-carriage hot-rodders . Turn-of-the-century female cyclists wore neckties , Gibbings speculates , to make them `` honorary men '' -- in other words , to indicate that they were not outdoors for disreputable purposes . There 's occasionally more detail than many people will want here , as in the technical discussion of the Resilient Lining technique used in nearly all modern ties , and exactly how Pierre Cardin licenses his designs . But this book offers more than neckwear for thought . In its own way , it 's a light on history.Charles Perry
