I ca n't believe the Kings are breaking up the best announcing team in Los Angeles . By demoting Nick Nickson to radio only and replacing him with former player and rookie broadcaster Jim Fox , King fans come up big losers . With Bob Miller and Nick you were always sure to get an accurate and honest call of the game , with no cheerleading . BILL NOYES Diamond Bar
