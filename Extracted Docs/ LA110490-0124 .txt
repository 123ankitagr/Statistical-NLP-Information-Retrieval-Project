It 's about time there has been something written to tell people how hard gang life is on its members and how most , if given an opportunity , a genuine opportunity , would not be involved . They are just children , most of them hardened by a life many of us could n't imagine . As an African-American , I would like to see and read more about real-life gang success stories . I would like to say to Baby Insane , if he should read this : Hang in there , little brother . Stay on the straight and narrow , and remember there will be many of us who are hoping and praying you continue your new life successfully . JANICE SMITH El Toro
