QUESTION : I have been renting a condominium in San Pedro since March . I have a month-to-month rental agreement . The rental agreement calls for a 30-day written notice by either the owner or renter to terminate the occupancy of the unit . The problem is that I have just been asked verbally to move by the end of the month . The owner made no mention of any relocation money . I read in your recent Times column that tenants are entitled to $ 2,000 relocation money if asked to move by the landlord . ( The owner is selling and the new owner wants to move in . ) Here are my problems and questions . Do I have to move based upon the verbal notice ? Do I get any relocation money ? If yes , how much do I get ? Do I get any more because my fiance lives with me and is on the rental agreement ? ANSWER : Unless your condo is new construction or luxury housing , as defined by L.A. 's rent ordinance , it is likely covered by the rent law and entitles you to relocation money . First , let 's review the exemptions . New construction is defined as anything for which a `` first certificate of occupancy '' was issued after October 31 , 1978 . Luxury housing is defined as housing that rented for the following monthly rent levels , regardless of current rent levels , as of May 31 , 1978 : 0-bedrooms , $ 320 ; 1-bedroom , $ 420 ; 2-bedrooms , $ 588 ; 3-bedrooms , $ 756 , or 4 or more bedrooms , $ 823 . The unit or building may also be exempted because it was substantially renovated , however , assuming it is n't , and you are covered by the rent law , you are entitled to relocation money in the amount of $ 2,000 . ( You do n't get anything extra for the fiance . ) As far as when you may have to move , state law requires a 30-day written notice , just as it is written into your rental agreement . What Would Manager 's Rent Be If He Quits ? Q : I have managed a nine-unit apartment building in Mar Vista for 11 years . When I moved in , the rent was $ 250 a month . New tenants moving in now pay $ 675 . My rent has remained at $ 175 a month for the past 11 years . My question is this : If I give up managing this unit , what will my rent be ? The apartment has been under rent control all these years . Had I moved in and not managed 11 years ago , my rent would be $ 450 . Will that be my rent or will it be $ 650 or some other amount ? A : It sounds like your rent will be about $ 450 a month . Here 's the formula according to Los Angeles Rent Stabilization Director Barbara Zeidman . Because you moved in as the manager , if you quit the job and stay , the rent will be the `` base rent '' amount plus all of the annual adjustments allowed to it since 1978 . In other words , $ 250 plus 7 % per year through June 30 , 1985 . After that the annual increases varied at the following rates : 4 % from July 1 , 1985 to June 30 , 1986 ; 5 % from July 1 , 1986 to June 30 , 1987 ; 4 % from July 1 , 1987 to June 30 , 1988 ; 4 % from July 1 , 1988 to June 30 , 1989 , and 5 % from July 1 , 1989 to June 30 , 1990 . Assuming a 7 % rent increase in 1985 and 5 % in 1990 , with no other rent adjustments allowed , our calculators say the rent would be $ 469.79 a month . No Interest Is Paid on Deposits in Long Beach Q : In 1985 the deposit for our one-bedroom apartment in Long Beach was $ 560 . When we recently moved , we got a check for $ 560 within two weeks as required by state law . Here 's my question . Since the money was literally `` on deposit , '' are n't we entitled to interest on it ? A : There is no requirement for apartment owners to pay interest on security deposits in Long Beach . Very few California cities require interest payments on such deposits . And while it may seem unfair that you get no interest on your money , remember that the annual interest on a $ 560 deposit would likely be paid at about a 5.75 % rate , yielding $ 32.20 . The bookkeeping costs required to administer the records and payments of such systems have been estimated at a minimum of $ 35 a unit that turns over . That includes reporting of any interest payments over $ 10 to the IRS and Franchise Tax Board . Rent Reduction Due If Amenity Removed Q : Recently , the owner of our Mid-Wilshire apartment building installed security gates and increased our rents . That 's fine , however , two years ago he eliminated the swimming pool here but did not lower the rents . Should n't he have lowered the rents when he removed that amenity ? If yes , is the reduction retroactive to the date of the removal of the pool ? A : While Los Angeles ' rent law does require rent reductions for diminished services , there is no specific dollar amount of reduction for swimming pools . Jim Fleck , the house planning and economic analyst for the city of Los Angeles ' Rent Stabilization Division , recommends that you and your fellow renters attempt to work out a solution with the owner . If he refuses to negotiate , file a complaint with the city . If it ca n't work out a rent reduction compromise with the owner , it may prosecute him in court .
