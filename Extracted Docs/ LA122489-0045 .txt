question i have been renting a condominium in san pedro since march i have a month-to-month rental agreement the rental agreement calls for a 30-day written notice by either the owner or renter to terminate the occupancy of the unit the problem is that i have just been asked verbally to move by the end of the month the owner made no mention of any relocation money i read in your recent times column that tenants are entitled to 2,000 relocation money if asked to move by the landlord the owner is selling and the new owner wants to move in here are my problems and questions do i have to move based upon the verbal notice do i get any relocation money if yes how much do i get do i get any more because my fiance lives with me and is on the rental agreement answer unless your condo is new construction or luxury housing as defined by l a s rent ordinance it is likely covered by the rent law and entitles you to relocation money first let's review the exemptions new construction is defined as anything for which a first certificate of occupancy was issued after october 31, 1978 luxury housing is defined as housing that rented for the following monthly rent levels regardless of current rent levels as of may 31, 1978 0-bedrooms 320 1-bedroom 420 2-bedrooms 588 3-bedrooms 756, or 4 or more bedrooms 823 the unit or building may also be exempted because it was substantially renovated however assuming it isn't and you are covered by the rent law you are entitled to relocation money in the amount of 2,000 you don't get anything extra for the fiance as far as when you may have to move state law requires a 30-day written notice just as it is written into your rental agreement what would manager's rent be if he quits q i have managed a nine-unit apartment building in mar vista for 11 years when i moved in the rent was 250 a month new tenants moving in now pay 675 my rent has remained at 175 a month for the past 11 years my question is this if i give up managing this unit what will my rent be the apartment has been under rent control all these years had i moved in and not managed 11 years ago my rent would be 450 will that be my rent or will it be 650 or some other amount a it sounds like your rent will be about 450 a month here's the formula according to los angeles rent stabilization director barbara zeidman because you moved in as the manager if you quit the job and stay the rent will be the base rent amount plus all of the annual adjustments allowed to it since 1978 in other words 250 plus 7 per year through june 30, 1985 after that the annual increases varied at the following rates 4 from july 1, 1985 to june 30, 1986 5 from july 1, 1986 to june 30, 1987 4 from july 1, 1987 to june 30, 1988 4 from july 1, 1988 to june 30, 1989, and 5 from july 1, 1989 to june 30, 1990 assuming a 7 rent increase in 1985 and 5 in 1990, with no other rent adjustments allowed our calculators say the rent would be 469.79 a month no interest is paid on deposits in long beach q in 1985 the deposit for our one-bedroom apartment in long beach was 560 when we recently moved we got a check for 560 within two weeks as required by state law here's my question since the money was literally on deposit aren't we entitled to interest on it a there is no requirement for apartment owners to pay interest on security deposits in long beach very few california cities require interest payments on such deposits and while it may seem unfair that you get no interest on your money remember that the annual interest on a 560 deposit would likely be paid at about a 5.75 rate yielding 32.20 the bookkeeping costs required to administer the records and payments of such systems have been estimated at a minimum of 35 a unit that turns over that includes reporting of any interest payments over 10 to the irs and franchise tax board rent reduction due if amenity removed q recently the owner of our mid-wilshire apartment building installed security gates and increased our rents that's fine however two years ago he eliminated the swimming pool here but did not lower the rents shouldn't he have lowered the rents when he removed that amenity if yes is the reduction retroactive to the date of the removal of the pool a while los angeles rent law does require rent reductions for diminished services there is no specific dollar amount of reduction for swimming pools jim fleck the house planning and economic analyst for the city of los angeles rent stabilization division recommends that you and your fellow renters attempt to work out a solution with the owner if he refuses to negotiate file a complaint with the city if it can't work out a rent reduction compromise with the owner it may prosecute him in court
