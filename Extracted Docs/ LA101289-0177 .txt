The staff of the city attorney 's office on Wednesday continued to defend its decision not to prosecute Mayor Tom Bradley for alleged conflicts of interest as a City Council ethics panel pushed the lawyers to explain how they reached their conclusions . `` What was missing in this case to prosecute ? `` asked Councilman Gloria Molina in the third day of hearings . `` I do n't know how else to ask it . '' Molina was referring to Bradley 's relationship with Far East National Bank , the focus of much of the ethics committee hearing Wednesday afternoon . Bradley was paid $ 18,000 in 1988 as a consultant to the bank , which obtained $ 3 million in city deposits in 1988 and 1989 . Bradley returned the payments . In a report released last month , City Atty . James K. Hahn said there was `` damaging '' evidence that Far East benefitted financially from Bradley 's influence , but he said the evidence was not strong enough to prove that Bradley intentionally caused the $ 3 million to be deposited in the bank . That evidence was circumstantial , Assistant City Atty . Charles Goldenberg told the ethics panel Wednesday . The city attorney 's office determined that the circumstantial evidence was too equivocal `` for us to have any reasonable chance of successfully prevailing at a trial , '' Goldenberg said . A key piece of circumstantial evidence was a letter sent to Bradley in January , 1988 , by Henry Hwang , chairman of Far East . In the letter , Hwang sought Bradley 's help in getting deposits . The letter was forwarded to City Treasurer Leonard Rittenberg and subsequently $ 1 million in city funds was deposited in Far East . Further , Bradley telephoned Rittenberg last March 22 and within hours Rittenberg reinstated a $ 1-million deposit in Far East and added another $ 1 million . Goldenberg said Wednesday that there was no direct evidence that the mayor `` ordered the treasurer 's office to do their machinations . '' He said the transactions might be explained simply by the `` craziness '' in the treasurer 's office . In deciding whether to press criminal charges , Goldenberg said , `` We make the determination about whether or not there is a likelihood we could win . ''
