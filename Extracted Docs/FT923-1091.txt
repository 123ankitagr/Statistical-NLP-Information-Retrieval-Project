AIR CANADA , now working on a merger with Canadian Airlines International , has forged a commercial alliance with Air France , writes Robert Gibbens in Montreal . The agreement , effective from April 3 1993 , will allow Air Canada better access to European , African , Mid-East and Asian markets via Paris , while Air France will improve its access to North America through Montreal and Toronto . Scheduling , customer and frequent-flyer services and freight will be co-ordinated . Air Canada signed a similar deal in August with United Airlines . That link-up , effective on October 25 , will improve service and cut connection time at the airlines ' hubs in North America , Europe , Latin America and the Pacific . Air France plans to absorb its Union des Transports Aeriens ( UTA ) unit . No financial deal would be involved , Reuter reports from Paris . Air France said UTA aircraft would bear Air France colours . It said the move would improve the airlines ' ability to face the crisis in the industry .
