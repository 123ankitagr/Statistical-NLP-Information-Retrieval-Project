A dissident South Korean student trying to return from an unauthorized visit to North Korea was turned back after marching to the border . Im Su Kyong , 20 , and a dissident South Korean priest led about 500 others in a rally in the truce village of Panmunjom , about 35 miles north of Seoul , demanding that the marchers be allowed to cross the border . The village is in the demilitarized zone separating the two nations . Im and her group of peace marchers finally turned back and marched north , with Im saying she would not cross the border unless she is met by relatives and friends , officials said .
