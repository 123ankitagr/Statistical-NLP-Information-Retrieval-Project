microfilm still has a place in business but the emergence of computer-based document processing systems means its role will be confined to long-term archiving this is the view of kodak which builds both types of document storage system its view is backed by consultants and suppliers of systems based on optical disc storage the computer-output microfilm business is growing by five per cent a year but this is mainly from existing users expanding their systems rather than from new users says mr colin cooke a manager in kodak's uk office imaging operation microfilm is best if the application is truly archival with very low retrieval demands here it is very cheap and lasts 100 years or more without deteriorating in addition so far it is the only alternative to the original document that has been accepted in a court mr cooke says the insurance industry is a typical user of microfilm because it needs to keep documents such as those relating to life insurance for very many years at the other end of the scale is magnetic storage associated with computers magnetic tape has been used for archiving but the quality of the storage can be at risk after seven or eight years access is far from instant tapes have to be retrieved from a store and run through from the start until the required records are found magnetic discs offer virtually instant access but at high cost and as with tape the quality deteriorates colin cooke says magnetic disc systems cost seven times more than optical discs systems in terms of the storage equipment alone optical discs are a compromise between microfilm and magnetic discs retrieval times are slow by computing standards although documents are nonetheless brought to the screen in five to 20 seconds depending on factors such as the number of documents on a disc and the number of discs and drives in a juke box the life of optical discs is put at between 30 and 50 years although they have not been around long enough for this to be proved in live use their long life compared with that of magnetic discs is not least due to the fact that the unit which writes and reads data to and from the disc uses a laser beam and therefore never touches the disc surface the original optical discs could only be recorded on once but recent years have seen the emergence of discs on which data can be erased or overwritten there are mixed views on whether the benefits of this advance if the data can be erased these optical disc systems could be considered as rivals to traditional magnetic discs with massive capacity in a smaller box and at far less cost their disadvantage here is their retrieval times w hich are far too slow for every-day data processing colin cooke at kodak is among those who believe the very fact that the original optical disc systems recorded data only once was one of their main benefits one of their attractions lies in their key feature of providing permanent stable storage he says microfilm optical and magnetic disc systems computer-output optical magnetic microfilm disc disc capital very low high full high cost bureau processing system including full medium workflow system in-house processing software retrieval very slow fast very fast time minutes 3 to 25 within 3 at least seconds seconds stability very long medium short 100 years 30 to 50 years 7 to 12 years application long archiving medium short-term little or no access archiving storage daily access instant access
