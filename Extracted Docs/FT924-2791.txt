MICROFILM still has a place in business but the emergence of computer-based document processing systems means its role will be confined to long-term archiving . This is the view of Kodak , which builds both types of document storage system . Its view is backed by consultants and suppliers of systems based on optical disc storage . 'The computer-output microfilm business is growing by five per cent a year , but this is mainly from existing users expanding their systems rather than from new users , ' says Mr Colin Cooke , a manager in Kodak 's UK Office Imaging operation . 'Microfilm is best if the application is truly archival , with very low retrieval demands . Here it is very cheap and lasts 100 years or more without deteriorating . In addition , so far it is the only alternative to the original document that has been accepted in a court . ' Mr Cooke says the insurance industry is a typical user of microfilm , because it needs to keep documents such as those relating to life insurance for very many years . At the other end of the scale is magnetic storage associated with computers . Magnetic tape has been used for archiving but the quality of the storage can be at risk after seven or eight years . Access is far from instant : tapes have to be retrieved from a store and run through from the start until the required records are found . Magnetic discs offer virtually instant access but at high cost and , as with tape , the quality deteriorates . Colin Cooke says magnetic disc systems cost seven times more than optical discs systems in terms of the storage equipment alone . Optical discs are a compromise between microfilm and magnetic discs . Retrieval times are slow by computing standards , although documents are nonetheless brought to the screen in five to 20 seconds , depending on factors such as the number of documents on a disc and the number of discs and drives in a juke box . The life of optical discs is put at between 30 and 50 years , although they have not been around long enough for this to be proved in live use . Their long life , compared with that of magnetic discs , is not least due to the fact that the unit which writes and reads data to and from the disc uses a laser beam and therefore never touches the disc surface . The original optical discs could only be recorded on once but recent years have seen the emergence of discs on which data can be erased or overwritten . There are mixed views on whether the benefits of this advance . If the data can be erased these optical disc systems could be considered as rivals to traditional magnetic discs , with massive capacity in a smaller box and at far less cost . Their disadvantage here is their retrieval times , w hich are far too slow for every-day data processing . Colin Cooke at Kodak is among those who believe the very fact that the original optical disc systems recorded data only once was one of their main benefits . 'One of their attractions lies in their key feature of providing permanent , stable storage , ' he says . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Microfilm , optical and magnetic disc systems -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Computer-output Optical Magnetic microfilm disc disc -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - CAPITAL Very low , High ( full High COST ( bureau processing ) . system , including ( full Medium , workflow system ) ( in-house processing ) . software ) RETRIEVAL Very slow Fast Very fast TIME ( minutes , ( 3 to 25 ( within 3 at least ) seconds ) seconds ) STABILITY Very long Medium Short ( 100 years ) ( 30 to 50 years ) ( 7 to 12 years ) APPLICATION Long archiving , Medium Short-term little or no access archiving , storage , daily access instant access -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
