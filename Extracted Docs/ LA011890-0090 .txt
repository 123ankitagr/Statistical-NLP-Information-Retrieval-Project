Stanford University officials proposed to ban alcohol consumption at all Stanford athletic events . The proposal was prompted in part by the 27 alcohol-related arrests at the Stanford-UC Berkeley football game in November . Stanford has been the only school in the Pacific-10 athletic conference to allow spectators to bring alcohol inside a stadium . Three years ago , Stanford banned hard liquor at games and limited each person over 21 to carrying in one six-pack of beer . The proposal would also prohibit advertising of alcohol at university events , declare anyone convicted of drunk driving ineligible for university parking permits and ban the purchase of alcohol with student fees collected by the university . Final approval by President Donald Kennedy is expected later this year . `` We 're probably at the point now where we are better off saying 'no alcohol . ' I find it hard to believe that people ca n't go three hours without a drink , '' said Marv Herrington , the university 's director of public safety .
