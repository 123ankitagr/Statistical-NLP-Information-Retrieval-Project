On the morning of Jan. 28 , 1986 , much of the nation tuned into coverage of the Challenger space shuttle launch and watched in horror as the shuttle exploded within seconds of takeoff , snuffing out the lives of its seven astronauts . Among them was Christa McAuliffe , the first private citizen to fly in space . The lives of those five men and two women and the technical problems that plagued the mission from the outset are the subject of `` Challenger , '' a three-hour movie premiering tonight at 8 on ABC . Karen Allen , best known for her starring role in `` Raiders of the Lost Ark , '' plays McAuliffe . Brian Kerwin is featured as shuttle pilot Mike Smith and Barry Bostwick portrays shuttle commander Dick Scobee . Initially , Allen did n't want to have anything to do with the project . `` I did n't think the tragedy was something I 'd like to make a film about , '' she said . She was more open to `` Challenger '' after she read the script written by the film 's co-executive producer , George Englund . `` It was really a homage to the seven astronauts and was not exploitative in anyway , '' she said . `` The fact that he never showed the accident and concentrated on their lives and who they were -I really found it wonderful . '' But Allen was eventually won over because of McAuliffe , the high school teacher and mother from Concord , New Hampshire . `` I think she was one of those people who makes America great , '' Allen said . `` She had a real positive outlook on life . She was very dedicated to being involved in the community and in other people 's lives . `` I had a few extraordinary teachers in my life -I feel they really influenced the course of my life . I have a feeling she was that kind of person . She had the ability to make you feel your life counts . '' In preparation , Allen spent hours watching and re-watching videos of McAuliffe . `` I watched her early press conferences and read quite a few interviews with her , '' she said . By studying the tapes , Allen said , she was able to capture McAuliffe 's `` rhythm '' -- how she walked , talked , stood and even how she held her head . By the time Allen arrived at NASA 's Johnson Space Center in Houston last summer to shoot `` Challenger , '' the actress felt a kinship to McAuliffe . `` You 're entering another person 's life and world and getting to know them , '' she said . `` You become acquainted with them in a very intimate way as you look into their lives and talk to people who knew them . You get drawn into a world you otherwise would n't get to know . '' At NASA , Allen worked alongside the same people who knew and worked with McAuliffe . `` I think when we were first there , '' she recalled , `` there was a little tentativeness . They were checking us out and trying to see how serious we were . I think in the process there were some really nice exchanges between the group of actors and the people working there . I think basically they felt that what we were doing was good . '' Allen went through a lot of the same training McAuliffe did , including a pilot training course so she could obtain a special license to fly in the KC-135-the plane that simulates weightlessness . However , she never went up in the plane . `` There was a crack in the wheel joint , and they had to cancel our trip , '' Allen said . `` There was n't time for us to go on it again . '' But she did get the chance to spend time in the decompression chamber . `` We had to experience the symptoms of hypoxia-the lack of oxygen , '' she said . `` You can pass out , get very dizzy , become belligerent or get hot flashes and cold chills . My first symptoms were hot flashes . `` Everybody 's symptoms are different . Once you discover what yours are , you always have the same symptoms . It 's fascinating . '' Spending a month at the Johnson Space Center was an unforgettable experience for Allen . She admitted that she would n't mind becoming the first actress/astronaut . `` I would be thrilled to go up , '' she said `` I think I should go up if I have the opportunity to do it . I got such a wonderful taste of the program and their plans for the future . I find it all remarkably interesting . '' It took co-executive producer/ writer George Englund nearly two years to get NASA 's cooperation on `` Challenger . '' `` I 've got the scar tissue , '' said the veteran producer , whose credits include the acclaimed 1988 CBS movie , `` Terrorist on Trial : Salim Ajami . '' `` The first people I talked to were the heads of the astronaut programs who said they could not see any possible use in the project . They were real hurt . It was their friends who had perished . `` It was the most devastating thing that had happened in the history of the agency . The future of NASA was unclear . They had a subconscious disposition to think a producer was looking for the exploitable parts and aspects of it . That was n't my thought . It took them a while to understand that . '' Englund , though , experienced even more difficulty approaching the families of the Challenger astronauts . `` They above everybody else did n't want to have anything to do with anything about the accident , '' he said . `` Eventually , I showed them the versions of the script , and they felt some things were inaccurate . So I corrected those things . My aim in all of this was to get it right . I hope the film lands close to the target . '' `` I knew nothing about the astronauts before going into the project , '' said Brian Kerwin , who plays shuttle pilot Mike Smith . `` I saw the Challenger disaster on the news once and then stayed away from the news for the next two days . It was hideous . '' Like co-star Karen Allen , Kerwin had qualms about `` Challenger '' because , he said , `` the subject lends itself so easily to a tabloidesque exploitation . '' But he found the script a sensitive re-enactment of the event . At the Johnson Space Center , Kerwin found support from NASA employees , especially astronaut trainer Frank Hughes , who had instructed the Challenger crew . `` I do n't know if it was a catharsis for him or not , but Frank ended up writing me and the other actors involved letters saying 'thanks for sort of helping me put the accident a little more behind me . ' It 's not easy to work with people for 18 months and have them die all of a sudden . ''
