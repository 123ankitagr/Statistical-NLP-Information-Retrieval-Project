aerospatiale of france and deutsche aerospace yesterday merged their helicopter interests into a new company called eurocopter to form the world's second biggest helicopter manufacturer after sikorsky of the us mr jean-francois bigay eurocopter's chairman said the new company controlled by aerospatiale wanted to attract other partners including agusta of italy and westland of the uk its two european competitors as well as negotiate alliances with asian partners and possibly with a russian group he confirmed taiwan aerospace was interested in co-operating with eurocopter which already has ties with china japan and singapore the company is also conducting preliminary studies of possible co-operation with one of the russian helicopter design groups in the face of shrinking government defence budgets and a depressed civil helicopter market mr bigay said he expected to see the number of leading western helicopter manufacturers decline from eight to three or four by the end of the decade eurocopter is the first tangible move in this global rationalisation of the depressed helicopter industry but further rationalisation of the industry in europe is likely to prove difficult in the near term because westland and agusta have so far shown little interest in associating themselves with eurocopter westland which is also associated with sikorsky and agusta are co-operating on the eh101 naval and troop transport helicopter mr bigay said the combined aerospatiale and deutsche aerospace helicopter operations were expected to show a net profit in 1991 of about 4 per cent to 4.5 per cent of their combined turnover of ffr12 65 bn pounds 1.30 bn last year anything below that would be disappointing he said the combined operations won 256 new helicopter orders last year worth ffr3 4 bn with aerospatiale accounting for 216 of the new orders this was lower than the 290 orders aerospatiale's helicopter division won in 1990 and reflected the depressed market mr bigay said military orders had reached their lowest level since 1960 and prospects for 1992 remained bleak a further uncertainty was the german government's recent proposal to reduce its requirement for the new tiger anti-tank helicopter currently being developed by eurocopter by dm2bn pounds 700 m between 1993 and 2005 he warned that the decline in defence spending could lead to more structural problems for the helicopter industry but eurocopter planned to strengthen its leadership position in the civil helicopter market to help offset the decline in defence business
