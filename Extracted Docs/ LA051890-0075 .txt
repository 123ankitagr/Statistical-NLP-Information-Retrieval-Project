Surgeons removed the voice box of former hostage Robert Polhill on Thursday in what doctors called a successful operation to rid his body of cancer . `` He 's in intensive care after undergoing surgery , '' Walter Reed Army Medical Center spokesman Ben Smith said . `` His condition 's good . Smith quoted doctors as saying the cancer had not spread beyond Polhill 's larynx , or voice box . Polhill , 55 , was freed April 22 after more than three years in captivity in Lebanon . Army Dr. Russ Zajtchuk said Wednesday that Polhill , a smoker , will not be able to speak normally after the operation but he will be able to communicate , perhaps with an electronic larynx . Polhill , whose voice was faint and raspy in the days following his release , also will receive radiation treatment after his recuperation .
