The birthday of former President Richard M. Nixon will become a holiday for the employees of Yorba Linda , the city that claims Nixon as its native son . `` We 're not here to judge history , we 're here to recognize it , '' Mayor Henry W. Wedaa said . Wedaa said that despite Nixon 's resignation from the presidency in 1974 under the cloud of the Watergate scandal , the proposal to commemorate his birthday has met with warm response . `` Since the resolution was proposed , I have been amazed at the positive response that 's come forth , '' he said . `` Many of us have felt it was time for a holiday for President Nixon , and the time has come . '' The City Council voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to declare a city holiday each Jan. 9 , the day Nixon was born in a Yorba Linda farmhouse in 1913 . `` Fifteen years have elapsed since President Nixon 's resignation , and history has shown the importance of his presidency , particularly with respect to his brilliance in foreign policy , '' the resolution said . Wedaa , who proposed the measure two weeks ago , said he hoped that the Richard M. Nixon Presidential Library now under construction in Yorba Linda will schedule special events for the holiday . The response from Nixon to having a city holiday in his honor is `` that he 's pleased , '' Wedaa said .
