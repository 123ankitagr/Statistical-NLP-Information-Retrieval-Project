after years of peddling soft drinks laundry detergent and other consumer goods for major corporations bob wallace decided two years ago to take his experience and strike out on his own armed with a few thousand dollars and years of marketing savvy the former los angeles marketing manager for pepsico inc and lever bros started an export management company to help others do what he does best sell in the international market his goal is simple im giving the little davids of this world a shot at the world market wallace said im the scout sent out to reconnoiter for the advancing troops wallace marketing director of exports international co in santa ana is among a growing pool of former international marketing managers who have left large corporations to work as export consultants for small and mediumsize companies most export managers have previous corporate experience and have an entrepreneurial spirit said edward chavez president of anaheim marketing international an export management firm in anaheim and export management is one area that allows them to use this entrepreneurial characteristic to exploit their marketing abilities and knowledge of the international market demand for export assistance has increased as more small and mediumsize companies many with no prior experience in foreign markets try to peddle their wares abroad said martin magdaleno president of sel pro international an anaheim export management firm also many companies cant afford to hire a fulltime international marketing manager he said a lot of times the local manufacturers have a great product but they dont export because they dont want to be bothered with the extra paper work and bureaucracy said magdaleno a former manager of beckman instruments international division moreover many us companies are reluctant to take the time and effort to understand a foreign nations culture and trade practices often a key to success abroad and companies that are doing brisk business in the us market are sometimes reluctant to spend money on a possibly risky overseas marketing program said patrick killeen marketing vice president for pec international trading co in san marcos its very expensive to market products abroad because so many things fall through unless you stay on top of things youre not going to make any foreign sales said jerry mcspadden president of custom business solutions inc a rochester ny firm that manages the export activities of 135 us small and mediumsize companies abroad export managers typically perform a number of services for their clients from handling export paper work to performing market research and designing product brochures what we really do is find buyers for usmade products mcspadden said we act like the export department of a major american company were the conduits between the companies and their foreign buyers most export management companies are paid a percentage of the foreign business they help generate usually 10 to 15 of the total sales wallace of exports international said many of his clients paid scant attention to export business and started selling abroad only after landing an unexpected foreign order susan francis president of market visions international a novelty gift manufacturer in santa ana and a client of wallace said selling abroad was an afterthought for her firm like many small companies we were intending to sell only to the us market which was more lucrative she said but that changed when orders from overseas distributors who saw her products at us trade shows began pouring in last year market visions hottestselling items particularly in japan are mens and womens underwear rolled into plastic stems to resemble longstem roses or underwear and socks tucked into plastic easter eggs these products are marketed under such labels as panty rose jockey eggs jock in the box and just hatched i didnt know what to do with those orders since ive not handled anything like this in my life francis said as it is im busy enough running the company and i cant take on an extra load so she hired wallace to manage all her export activities on a commission basis so did nine eagles golf co in santa ana when the golf club maker decided to take a swing at the foreign market last year today nine eagles does not just import golf club components from taiwan but also sells the finished goods back to the taiwanese and to japan and other countries but with international trade heating up some export managers have entered the export business for themselves some companies buy directly from manufacturers and sell to foreign distributors at a profit for instance custom business began marketing on its own wooden neckties made by timber ties inc near boston the ties retail at $ 20 to $ 40 this week custom shipped a container full of stainresistant wooden ties worth more than $ 100000 to a south korean distributor stephanie bogan a consultant to the export managers assn of california in van nuys said large companies dont often use export management companies and when they do it usually involves sales of product lines the manufacturer is not familiar with
