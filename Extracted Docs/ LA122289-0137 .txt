Without fanfare or hype , city employee Dennis Hittle each year collects a small truckload of food , clothing and toiletries to give to the homeless at Christmas . The donors are fellow city employees who drop canned food and clothing into one of the three stainless-steel trash cans that Hittle sets up at City Hall , the police station and the city yard . The cans have a homey touch , being decorated with homemade signs and colored bows . `` It 's almost become a custom and tradition here , '' said Robert Savage , director of the city maintenance service department , where Hittle , 48 , has worked for 23 years . `` People know that every year , Dennis is going to set his trash cans up . '' This is the fifth year for Hittle 's project . On Saturday , he and a group of co-workers will drive to downtown Los Angeles to distribute the items to the people at the Union Rescue Mission . Hittle chose the mission , he said , because it tries to care for the spirit as well as the body . He had visited the mission several years ago with a friend and decided then that the people there could use some extra help from individuals . `` It 's something we as city employees can do , '' Hittle said . `` You really do n't have to wait for an organization to start it . '' Hittle set up his first can at the city yard in 1984 after receiving permission from his supervisor . `` We got approval to do this at the city yard , but I thought , 'why not go citywide ? ' `` Hittle said . `` So I went to talk to the city manager . '' He admitted to having been a little nervous about approaching the city manager . But he need n't have . City Manager William C. Winter said : `` I thought it was a really fine effort by a city employee who would want to do something like that on his own . . . . It 's a morale booster . He sets an example for other city employees . '' TOM McQUEENEY
