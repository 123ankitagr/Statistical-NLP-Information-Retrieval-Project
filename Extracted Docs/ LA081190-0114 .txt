Columbia Savings & Loan Assn . filed a lawsuit Friday against one of its former vice presidents and two other men , accusing them of taking part in a multimillion-dollar equipment-leasing fraud scheme against the ailing thrift . The racketeering suit filed in federal court accuses Jeffrey S. Worthy , Columbia 's former director of financial planning , with taking more than $ 1 million in kickbacks in the alleged scheme . The suit describes $ 31 million worth of leasing deals set up by Worthy , Michael E. Parker of Newport Beach and Brian W. Fink of Orange County as `` an illegal scheme to defraud Columbia of millions of dollars . '' Parker , Worthy and Fink could not immediately be reached for comment . Worthy 's company J. S. Worthy Enterprises of Downey was also named as a defendant . Parker 's now-bankrupt Costa Mesa company , Parker North American Corp. , of which Fink was an executive , arranged leasing deals with Columbia between 1983 and 1987 for equipment such as automated teller machines , computers and restaurant equipment , the suit said . Some of the deals never occurred and the documents and invoices were created by the defendants , the suit states . In others , equipment prices were inflated or ownership of the equipment was sold to more than one investor , the suit said . Under the leasing deals , Columbia would pay 20 % in cash to PNAC to buy the equipment on Columbia 's behalf , the suit said . The rest of the money would be provided by a third-party lender . The equipment would then be leased by PNAC to its ultimate user and the rental payments used to pay off the third-party loan . As the owner of the equipment , Columbia stood to garner significant tax benefits from the deals put together by PNAC .
