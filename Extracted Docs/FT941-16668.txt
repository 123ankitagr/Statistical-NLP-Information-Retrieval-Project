Pacific Telesis , the San Francisco-based Baby Bell telephone company , is to take a Dollars 576m fourth-quarter reserve to cover a corporate restructuring which will eliminate 10,000 jobs by the end of 1997 . This is the latest of several large job-cutting programmes announced in recent months by America 's local telecommunications companies as new rivals nibble away at their traditional monopolies . It follows the spin-off at the end of last year of Pacific Telesis 's mobile communications businesses into a separately quoted company . The reserve , with additional charges of Dollars 89m , will reduce fourth-quarter earnings by Dollars 1.58 a share . The job cuts involve Pacific Bell , Pacific Telesis 's most important business , which serves the Californian telephone market . It plans to cut 3,000 jobs in 1994 and 7,000 more over the next three years . The subsidiary employs about 52,000 people . Pacific Bell said the move formed part of a redesign of the company using a management technique called process re-engineering , which involves an examination of the way tasks are performed . It is instituting a cost-cutting programme , including a reduction of management levels and deferred executive salary increases . 'This will improve customer services , meet our customers ' need for lower prices and further prepare us for expanded competition , ' said Mr Phil Quigley , Pacific Bell 's president . Pacific Bell announced two months ago that it would spend Dollars 16bn to create a multi-media communications superhighway across its territory - one of the largest network modernisation programmes announced by local US telephone companies .
