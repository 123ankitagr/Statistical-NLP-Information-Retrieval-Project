The Times is correct in calling attention to the oil industry 's renewed attempt at offshore drilling in environmentally sensitive areas . These areas have unproven reserves and where oil is found it is in such small quantities as to be negligible in the entire energy picture . No , drilling off the California coast and areas such as the beautiful , biologically productive and very fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge must remain off-limits to the environmentally destructive oil industry . This country must develop a credible energy policy incorporating conservation , new energy sources and maximum exploitation of existing supplies . Great strides in energy conservation have been made in this nation , but as other nations have shown , particularly Japan , we can do much more without compromising our comfortable lifestyle . Increasing the fuel efficiency standards is a wise first step . A little leadership from Washington , is that too much to ask ? VANCE R. EWALD Grand Terrace
