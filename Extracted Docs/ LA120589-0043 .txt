Republican state Rep. David Duke , a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan , said that he will seek the U.S. Senate seat of J. Bennett Johnston ( D-La. ) . The Louisiana GOP plans to endorse a candidate Jan. 12 , but Duke said that he probably will run even if he is not the party 's choice . He joins a field of two other Republicans who are seeking Johnston 's seat . Duke , who in the past has been associated with the far-right Populist Party , disavowed his racist beliefs when he was sworn in as a state representative . Since leaving the klan in the 1970s , he has headed the National Assn . of White People , which he says promotes `` equal rights for everyone . ''
