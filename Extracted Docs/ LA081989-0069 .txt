for first time spacecraft voyager detected intense radio signals coming neptune revealing planet magnetic field indicating next weeks close encounter intriguing scientists hoped the discovery suggests spacecraft find wide range interesting phenomena passes close distant planet thursday night including kind auroral activity produces northern southern lights earth the signals first detected last monday scientists jet propulsion laboratory sure coming neptune according james warwick principal investigator planetary radio astronomy experiment not what was expected their character different expecting warwick said the radio emissions intense warwick said adding came short powerful bursts limited frequency range scientists expected radio signals neptune looking something less intense less limited frequencies warwick fellow scientists working project decided announce discovery friday grew confident seeing the discovery means neptune strong magnetic field radio waves generated charged particles become trapped magnetic field spiral planets atmosphere it process produces northern lights earth charged particles space flow along earths magnetic field lines atmosphere either north south pole producing celestial fireworks higher latitudes now voyager expected see thing neptune within 3000 miles the voyager spacecraft make fourth final planetary flyby next week passes within 3000 miles neptunes cloud tops used radio receiver giant pair rabbit ears detect radio emissions jupiter saturn uranus each 33footlong ear scans series frequencies since work separately polarization vibration signals determined thus distinguishing radio signals generated lightning created magnetic field we know dealing magnetic field warwick said the discovery magnetic field also tells scientists something interior neptune the earths magnetic field generated movement molten iron core neptunes strong magnetic field suggests neptune also region fluid interior venus mars probably pluto magnetic fields early analysis data voyager indicates neptunes magnetic field similar intensity earths as data collected magnetic field scientists able determine precisely length neptunian day time takes one rotation that believed 18 hours time voyager figure known exactly until scientists known little neptune things atmospheric composition includes methane makes appear blue but voyager pass right planets north pole fortuitous scientists interested magnetic field that trajectory carry intense field charged particles funneled polar atmosphere reveal much field in fact time voyager zips past neptune collected enough data scientists learn magnetic field planet except earth
