CHRYSLER , the US carmaker , yesterday had its debt rating upgraded to investment grade from speculative by Standard & Poor 's , the US credit rating agency . The move was foreshadowed in June , when S & P placed Chrysler 's double B plus senior debt rating on creditwatch with positive implications . Yesterday , S & P raised its rating on Chrysler and its credit arm , Chrysler Financial Corporation , to triple B . The company had about Dollars 12.8bn in outstanding debt at the end of June . S & P 's action completes Chrysler 's goal of cutting its borrowing costs . Moody 's Investors Service last month lifted Chrysler 's debt rating to investment grade . The higher grade allows Chrysler access to a broader investor base . It is particularly important for Chrysler Financial Corp , which borrows frequently in the bond markets . Chrysler has staged a dramatic financial recovery in recent years . S & P praised the company 's well-designed and fortuitously-timed new products , in addition to its improved operating efficiency . 'Management continues to demonstrate a conservative financial policy , lending confidence that the surplus cash generated in coming years will be used to further increase cash reserves and reduce debt , putting the company in a much better position to weather the next downturn , ' the agency said . However , S & P noted that Chrysler has a relatively thin product line and depends on a fiercely competitive market in North America . As a result , Chrysler 's fortunes are expected to continue to fluctuate widely , 'limiting the potential for additional rating upgrades ' , S & P said .
