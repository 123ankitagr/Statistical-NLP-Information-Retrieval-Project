The American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival opens today for two weeks at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas . Here is today 's schedule : 'The Long Weekend ( o ' Despair ) ' United States , 1989 , 93 minutes 8:30 p.m . Bargain-basement Bret Easton Ellis : Six post-punk characters spend a dreary weekend whining about Angst and ennui , which they mispronounce . The film is a disaster technically : Some scenes are so dimly lit ( and/or badly shot and/or stained from processing errors ) that it 's difficult to tell one character from another . Writer-producer-director Gregg Araki reportedly made this gritty exercise in self-indulgent alienation for $ 5,000 ; it looks like less . CHARLES SOLOMON
