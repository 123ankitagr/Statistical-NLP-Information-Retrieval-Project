In `` Ron Kovic Calls for Pullout From Gulf '' ( Aug. 23 ) , The Times reported on a counter demonstration led by Los Angeles businessman Robert Zirgulis . Zirgulis apparently identified himself as being from the International Human Rights Watch group . Human Rights Watch dissociates itself from all statements of Zirgulis and International Human Rights Watch . Human Rights Watch is a nonpartisan , nonprofit U.S.-based human rights monitoring organization that investigates , documents and publicizes violations of human rights throughout the world . Human Rights Watch takes no position on the U.S military buildup in Saudi Arabia . Rather it limits its investigations and advocacy to human-rights concerns . ELLEN L.
