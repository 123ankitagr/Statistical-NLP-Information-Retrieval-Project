EXPORTERS welcomed the announcement of fresh cuts in export insurance premium rates , and of additional export credit cover of Pounds 1.3bn over the next three years to be made available for companies bidding for business in developing countries where export success has led to unusually heavy export insurance exposure . Mr Lamont announced an average 7 1/2 per cent cut in premium rates , which have been a target of complaints by exporters . They claim foreign rivals gain a competitive advantage in bidding for contracts because their governments provide export credit cover at lower premium rates . The extra export credit cover , of which Pounds 300m will be available in the coming financial year , with Pounds 400m in 1994-95 , and Pounds 600m in 1995-96 , will be added to an extra Pounds 500m of cover for 1993-94 announced last November . This will be targeted at 12 markets , which include Hong Kong , China , Indonesia , South Africa and Malaysia , where UK exporters' success has been hindered by country limits intended to cap the exposure of the Export Credits Guarantee Department to any individual market . Some exporters will be disappointed that short term export credit reinsurance arrangements , capital investment write-downs , cuts in corporation tax , exporters ' loan guarantees and bankers ' export guarantees were not included . Mr Michael Heseltine , the secretary of state for trade and industry , yesterday said the moves were ' a further sign of the government's determination to help British companies win overseas contracts . ' Mr Ian Campbell , director general of the Institute for Export , said he was pleased that Mr Lamont had 'admitted that previous policies have led to competitive disadvantages ' . The budget hopes to improve relations with industry and to stimulate economic recovery by increasing exports .
