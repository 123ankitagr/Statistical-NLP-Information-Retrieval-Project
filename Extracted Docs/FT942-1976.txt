german money supply grew at 13.7 per cent a year in may down from 15.4 per cent in april the headline figure for the m3 measure of monetary growth was better than market expectations and the month on month increase was at its lowest level since november last year between april and may m3 grew by 0.5 per cent the figures were encouraging for the bundesbank facing a credibility problem with financial markets after runaway monetary growth in the past six months but economists warned the reduction in m3 growth could be temporary and that there was no chance the central bank would meet its 4 to 6 per cent target for m3 growth in the year the improvement in the figures reflected one-off factors such as the removal of the bundesbank's profit which had inflated the previous month's data but bank lending continued to rise last month and capital formation did not improve boding ill for monetary development in coming months bank lending a key factor behind monetary growth and potentially a trigger for future inflation rose by 9.9 per cent over the previous six months on an annualised basis an increase from the 9.5 per cent rate in may capital formation stagnated at the same level as in the previous month the bundesbank blamed special factors for continuing high levels of monetary growth especially the world-wide uncertainty over interest rates which had caused an investment blockage as investors left funds on short-term deposit rather than returning to bonds however economists disputed whether the state of the world capital markets could be described as a special factor and called on the bundesbank to make a clear statement of its monetary policy aims as mr hans tietmeyer bundesbank president insisted last week m3 remains the german central bank's most trusted guide to future inflationary developments a credibility problem has arisen because the central bank has cut interest rates aggressively despite the fact that money supply has overshot its target in each of the past two years and is virtually certain to do so again this year some economists say interest rates should be raised to bring m3 down but the bundesbank said its most recent discount rate cut would encourage investors away from short-term deposits into long-term investments turning conventional monetary wisdom on its head the figures released yesterday were too early to have been influenced by the new policy but economists warned the current state of world financial markets is likely to have prevented the desired shift in assets from taking place there could be a further acceleration in m3 growth in june as a result said mr holger fahrinkrug at schweizerische bankgesellschaft ubs in frankfurt this would put the bundesbank's whole strategy into disarray he said mr tietmeyer may take up the issue at a bundesbank press conference in potsdam tomorrow bundesbank council member mr lothar muller will resign from his position as head of the regional central bank in bavaria at the end of june the regional central bank said
