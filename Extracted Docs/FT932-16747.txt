heart disease is being attacked with a new and powerful scientific weapon genetically-engineered designer mice animals always have played a leading role in western medical research although this has led to ethical debate moral outrage and the occasional terrorist bombing but the deliberate creation of congenitally-diseased animals by genetic engineering is something else the main cause of heart disease and strokes causing death in the western world is atherosclerosis the hardening and narrowing of arteries by fatty plaques deposited in their walls these form when the concentration of cholesterol in the blood exceeds its cholesterol-carrying capacity ideally a complex biochemical mechanism in cells surrounding blood should ensure that cholesterol concentration never rises to dangerous levels but in humans the concentration is notoriously variable and often far too high could atherosclerosis be caused by a fault in this mechanism in the same way that diabetes arises from a fault in the sugar-regulating mechanism cholesterol is transported in the blood along with protein chaperones that keep it in solution and also present it to the regulatory mechanism of the surrounding cells many different proteins are involved but one called apoe is known to be abnormal in many humans with atherosclerosis to discover if defective apoe causes disease or is merely associated with it researchers needed to test the effect of eliminating normal apoe function in an otherwise perfectly normal animal genetic engineering allows the coding of genes for any protein to be modified so the researchers used genetic engineering to produce a mouse strain devoid of functional apoe genes and therefore of the apoe protein coded by them even on low-fat diets the mice showed abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol on high fat western-type diets they exhibited greatly elevated blood cholesterol and quickly developed serious atherosclerosis since normal mice are relatively resistant to fatty diets the blame for the atherosclerosis of the engineered animals can be laid right on defective apoe this experiment eventually could allow people to be screened for defective apoe genes at any age even before birth the results of such screening may affect anything from health education strategies to insurance premiums the natural resistance of non-human animals to fatty diets has long intrigued investigators who speculate that during their evolution humans may have lost a protective system or gained a dangerous one this hypothetical loss or gain would explain the fatty plaques which form in almost everyone careful comparisons between species have revealed that one cholesterol-handling component apo a is found only in humans and hedgehogs apo a can attach both to fatty droplets in blood and to the walls of arteries suggesting that it might actually help fatty plaques to form is human possession of this protein the key to our lethal sensitivity to fatty food to test this idea researchers have used genetic engineering to create a further strain of mouse which has human apo a in addition to its own mouse proteins on low-fat diets the animals are fairly healthy but if fed on western-type food they develop obvious atherosclerosis future work will aim to establish why humans have apo a and if its function can be antagonised usefully by drugs the logic behind this work is essentially the same as that underlying the earliest advances of pathology guess at the cause of a disease reproduce this cause in a healthy animal to see if the disease develops then try to cure the disease by antagonising that cause the innovation is the application of genetic engineering to this strategy
