hopes rose yesterday for a long-awaited breakthrough in the dispute between the us and north korea over pyongang's nuclear programme south korea's foreign minister mr han sung-joo said in seoul that agreement could be announced within a few days but in geneva where the two countries have been discussing a pact under which north korea would accept full nuclear inspections in return for improved ties with the us officials said there were still key difficult details to be agreed and any announcement was unlikely before next week under the agreement north korea would abandon its nuclear programme by replacing its dangerous graphite reactors with safer light-water models supplied from south korea which would help finance the dollars 4 bn project the us and north korea have apparently made rapid progress since wednesday after three weeks of largely futile talks mr han suggested that north korea's recent flexibility might be linked to possible assumption of power this weekend by mr kim jong-il the successor and son of the late president kim il-sung under the proposed pact north korea would accept international inspections of its undeclared nuclear facilities including two suspected nuclear waste dumps once the core equipment for the new light-water reactors are delivered in two to three years the international atomic energy agency iaea wants to examine the waste facilities to determine whether pyongyang reprocessed enough plutonium in 1989 for one or two nuclear bombs north korea triggered the nuclear dispute in march 1993 by rejecting the iaea demand and suspended its membership in the nuclear non-proliferation treaty npt the us and north korea will establish diplomatic liaison offices within six months if pyongyang returns to the npt the us-designed light-water reactors to be supplied to north korea produce less weapons-grade plutonium than pyongyang's current graphite models energy-short north korea will suspend construction of two 50 mw and 200 mw reactors and stop operation of its 5 mw reactor in return for alternative electricity supplies which will last until the light-water reactors are completed in eight to 10 years north korea would also keep in dry storage 8,000 plutonium-rich fuel rods that were removed in may from its nuclear reactor they would be taken to a third country for reprocessing once the first of the two light-water reactor units are completed officials from the two countries were meeting yesterday to resolve several issues including linking the resumption of inter-korean talks to the proposed accord south korea worried about being isolated from the negotiations wants talks with north korea by mid-january to discuss the implementation of their 1991 non-nuclear treaty pyongyang is so far refusing the south korean request which is being supported by the us mr lee hong-koo the south korean deputy prime minister for unification indicated that his government would accept the agreement if inter-korean talks were guaranteed but he acknowledged that there had been disagreements between seoul and washington over details of the proposed agreement although there is no difference on overall principles south korean officials are unhappy that full nuclear inspections will be delayed for a few years since this could give north korea additional time to develop at least one nuclear bomb from the plutonium that it is suspected to have already reprocessed at the geneva discussions us and north korean experts were contining to wrangle over final touches to their accord according to a us official once the wording was agreed the pact would be referred back to the respective governments a process which could take several days
