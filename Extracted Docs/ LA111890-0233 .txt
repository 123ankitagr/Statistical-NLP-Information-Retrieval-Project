the christmas shopping season officially begins this week for many consumers that means trouble already overextended with credit card borrowing and other debt too many consumers spend way beyond their means during the holidays when january rolls around theyre left with a hangover of unpaid bills and unhappy creditors christmas spending sprees will often be the final straw that hits people already in the debt doghouse says gary stroth executive director of the consumer credit counseling service of los angeles a nonprofit agency that helps people with debt problems the agencys busiest season for overextended consumers is january february and march once all the christmas bills arrive stroth says avoiding a debt disaster is especially important now as the economy flirts with a recession that could threaten your job pay raise or investments here are some commonsense tips on avoiding postholiday financial blues make a budget and stick to it figure out how much you can reasonably afford to spend one way is by listing your income from wages and investments and then subtracting your regular minimum monthly expenses such as rent or mortgage payments food auto loan payments insurance and utility bills whats left is discretionary income that you could use for christmas spending once you figure out how much you can afford make a list of those you will give to and the amounts per person take the list with you when you go shopping if you spend less on one person you can spend more on another shop for bargains but resist the temptation to spend more than your total so that you dont go broke saving money and dont go shopping at the last minute that causes impulse buying stroth adds recognize the warning signs of too much debt you have no business increasing your borrowing at all if you fit any of the following conditions your payments are always late and you are constantly receiving collection notices from creditors you are constantly taking cash advances on your credit card you are opening up more credit cards just to pay off debts on other cards you are using savings to pay basic monthly bills such as rent or utilities your savings total less than three months of aftertax earnings or you use more than 20 of your takehome pay to pay monthly nonmortgage installment debts such as car payments and credit card bills if you meet any of these conditions its time to cut back on your debts not add to them reduce your credit card costs if you tend to carry an account balance use bankissued credit cards such as visa or mastercard instead of retailerissued cards the average interest rate on bank cards is about 187 compared to 20 and higher for many retailer cards says elgie holstein director of bankcard holders of america a consumer credit protection group and by shopping around you can find bank cards with rates that are lower than average on the other hand if you pay off your accounts in full use a retail card holstein says they generally dont charge annual fees understand the costs of credit card promotions and gimmicks many issuers for example offer skip payment options where you dont have to pay every other month sounds great but finance charges will generally continue to accrue during the months you dont pay holstein says the same is often true of deferredpayment offers where you dont have to pay for several months consider alternatives to borrowing and spending use cash at least you can only spend what you have or go on a christmas savings program figure out what you spend on christmas and make it a point to save a twelfth of that amount each month during the year stroth suggests also the best gifts are not necessarily the most expensive or ones that you buy christmas presents that you make like baked goods show thoughtfulness and can be just as appreciated as any you purchase stroth says beware of credit scams holidays are heydays for credit scam artists holstein says his suggestions offer your credit card for identification but refuse to allow merchants to write your card numbers down on checks destroy carbons check billing statements carefully for purchases you did not make or that were never delivered and write your card issuer immediately to dispute such charges never give your card number over the phone unless you are certain that the company is reputable and keep your card in view when you give it to sales clerks to prevent them from making extra imprints know what to do if you get in trouble contact your creditors they can often help you work out a more manageable repayment schedule
