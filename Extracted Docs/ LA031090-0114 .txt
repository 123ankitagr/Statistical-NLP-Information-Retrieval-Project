Calling Proposition 103 a `` fraud , '' a state lawmaker who represents eight rural Northern California counties proposed a constitutional amendment reinstating territorial ratings as the chief factor in setting automobile insurance rates . Sen. Jim Nielsen ( R-Rohnert Park ) , vice chairman of the Senate Insurance , Claims and Corporations Committee , said banning the use of ZIP codes to price insurance under Proposition 103 unfairly forces rural drivers to subsidize insurance rates paid by urban dwellers . Nielsen contended that urban areas have a higher likelihood of accidents , lawsuits and fraudulent claims .
