Two brothers aboard a ship that rammed a fragile coral reef pleaded innocent in Miami to federal charges of operating the vessel recklessly and while intoxicated . A grand jury Wednesday indicted Michael Anthony Bishop , 43 , who was at the helm , and crew member Jerry Alan Bishop , 40 . State and federal investigators say the empty freighter cut a 200-foot swath through a reef . The Oct. 25 grounding of the 155-foot Alec Owen Maitland off Key Largo was the first of three groundings in the Florida Keys during a three-week period .
