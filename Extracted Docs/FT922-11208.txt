the house of commons faces the prospect today of the first contested election for its speaker who presides over commons proceedings for more than 40 years as it became clear that miss betty boothroyd labour's candidate will be proposed by mr john biffen a former tory cabinet minister the arrangements when mps meet this afternoon under the chairmanship of sir edward heath the father of the house the mp with the longest continuous service may tax even those who remember the last contest in 1951 then there were only two candidates while this time there may be four tory candidates as well as miss boothroyd many tories believe that if the tory field is split miss boothroyd is certain to win possibly leading some tories who favour other candidates to support the first conservative proposed as a result some tories believe there should be a change in the rules set out in erskine may westminster's procedural bible to make the contest less dependent on the first nomination erskine may says that once one candidate has been proposed and seconded then the debate proceeds to a vote only if another candidate is put forward in an amendment whether the original or alternative candidate wins further candidates can then be put forward in a series of knockout votes in each of which mps choose between two the proposed change which stands little chance of being accepted would mean that the first vote is simply on whether miss boothroyd should be speaker only if she were rejected would the tory vote have to be divided between individual candidates the process of successive divisions is so drawn-out that in the event mps may not wish to follow such a procedure through to the end and may settle on one candidate at an early stage if he or she seems likely to prevail overall in an uncontested election the proposer and seconder of the speaker conventionally come from opposite sides of the commons but there is some doubt about which of the tory candidates would get cross-party backing if miss boothroyd is in the running miss boothroyd's supporters say she has the support of up to 15 tory mps the speakership has conventionally been in the gift of the largest party but the question is one mps can decide for themselves and there is no party line
