There are not many places in America where a singer could start off as a country act and end up as a piano-playing R & B shouter , as Marcia Ball did , but there is one city where that would seem a natural course of events : Austin , Tex . Listen to her today , and her sound is pure New Orleans R & B , from her bluesy vocals , which recall the likes of Irma Thomas , to her two-fisted , Professor Longhair-style piano playing . A dozen years ago , though , she sang straight country , even releasing an album of traditional country songs in 1978 . That may seem quite a pendulum swing , but in truth , it simply reflects shifts in Austin 's musical history . Back in the '70s , Austin was the home of Willie Nelson , Waylon Jennings and a host of outlaw country singers . Ten years later , though , the big noise was from blues , and acts like Stevie Ray Vaughan , the Fabulous Thunderbirds and Lou Ann Barton were the ones getting the `` Austin sound '' ink . And through it all , Ball was in the process of finding her own sound . After growing up in Louisiana , she ended up in Austin pretty much by accident -- `` We were actually on our way to San Francisco , '' she said in a telephone interview from her Austin home , `` but we just stopped here and never left '' -- and made her recording debut as a country singer through a similar set of circumstances . `` My first band that got any attention , got popular at all , was a country band here in Austin , '' she said . `` That 's what led us to shop Nashville ( for a recording contract ) in the first place . '' Even so , she says , Austin 's music scene was not quite as pure country as outsiders imagined it . `` People would always ask about that , '' she said . `` But even at the time -- this would be in the late '70s -- the Thunderbirds and Stevie ( Ray Vaughan ) were emerging hard . In interviews , if people asked me about the country scene , I 'd say , 'It 's great and everything 's happening , but what is about to happen is really something else . ' While progressive country music was getting all the press , they were playing the clubs , honing their style . '' It was not long before Ball was joining them . `` After that one country band I was in ran its course , I started my own band and that was more influenced by my roots , rhythm and blues , '' she said . `` I grew up with that , with soul music and R & B and Fats Domino and Professor Longhair and Irma Thomas . `` By '78 . . . I had already moved in this direction . The show I was doing had moved definitely into the R & B thing . But in 1980 , I just decided that I was going to write R & B and I was going to find some of those guys who were playing R & B all that time , and learn from them . '' Part of what led Ball to make the switch was her interest in piano . `` I started playing piano in the country band I was in when I first moved to Austin , '' she said . `` There are not a lot of renowned pianists in country music , once you get past Floyd Cramer and Ronnie Milsap . That about said it . But New Orleans blues , and rhythm and blues , is full of piano players . '' Still , mastering that piano style was not easy , particularly for such an autodidact as Ball . `` It 's not a matter of basic ability , '' she said . `` When you listen to 'Fess ( Professor Longhair ) , so much of what he does is so simple . `` But it 's the syncopation of what he does . When I was learning how to play 'Big Chief , ' the left hand and right hand are completely disconnected . I got so I could play it pretty well , and someone said , ' I heard he recorded it one hand at a time . ' `` Do n't tell me now ! '' she said , laughing . She added , `` Of course , it was n't true .
