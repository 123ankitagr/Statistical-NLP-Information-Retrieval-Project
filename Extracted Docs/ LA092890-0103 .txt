Less than one week before German unification , the East and West German Social Democratic parties merged into a single organization and pledged to help the new Germany `` find its place in a peaceful Europe . '' When the two countries unite next Wednesday , the Social Democratic Party , or SPD , will be the largest opposition group to the conservative-led government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl in December elections . Only two of more than 550 delegates at the SPD 's reunification congress voted against the new party 's rules . `` Together we start work , so that for the first time in history Germany can find its place in a peaceful Europe , '' the party said in its new manifesto . `` Neither national self-contentment nor even nationalistic exuberance are needed now , but rather solidarity of Germans among themselves , '' the statement said . `` What is also needed is solidarity with the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe who are treading a new path , and with the majority of mankind , which is faced with bitter poverty , '' Before the vote , former West German Chancellor Willy Brandt told the delegates that `` Germany . . . needs social democracy .
