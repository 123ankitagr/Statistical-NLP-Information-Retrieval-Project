peugeot talbot is to spend around pounds 30 m to start production of a saloon version of the peugeot 306 hatchback early next year at its ryton plant near coventry the company said yesterday that the plant's output was to be increased from 1,820 cars a week to 2,000 cars a week from january creating several hundred new jobs among peugeot talbot's 70 component suppliers the government is providing pounds 1.2 m in grants for the expansion peugeot talbot uk production and distribution subsidiary of the french vehicles group expects the additional cars to lift ryton's total output from 73,000 this year to approaching 90,000 in 1995 and return the company to profitability last year peugeot talbot made its first loss since the late 1980 s pounds 8.7 m before tax mr geoffrey whalen peugeot talbot deputy chairman said there was little early prospect of more jobs at the ryton plant itself which employs 3,000 people this is because it has maintained double-shift working with downtime and temporary lay-offs in spite of the slump in uk and continental european markets which caused ryton's output to fall from a peak 116,000 units in 1990 by keeping the workforce intact ryton retains its capacity to make 120,000 cars a year even with the saloon 306, ryton is unlikely to be utilising its full capacity unless export demand for both 306 models expands considerably mr whalen said there were no plans to reintroduce the larger 405 saloon or its successor to be launched in france next year to ryton's assembly lines alongside the 306 models the 405, a big success in the uk fleet market accounted for most of ryton's production until the continental market slump led peugeot to confine 405 output to france at the end of 1992
