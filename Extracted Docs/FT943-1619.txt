Peugeot Talbot is to spend around Pounds 30m to start production of a saloon version of the Peugeot 306 hatchback early next year at its Ryton plant near Coventry . The company said yesterday that the plant 's output was to be increased from 1,820 cars a week to 2,000 cars a week from January creating 'several hundred ' new jobs among Peugeot Talbot 's 70 component suppliers . The government is providing Pounds 1.2m in grants for the expansion . Peugeot Talbot , UK production and distribution subsidiary of the French vehicles group , expects the additional cars to lift Ryton 's total output from 73,000 this year to approaching 90,000 in 1995 and return the company to profitability . Last year Peugeot Talbot made its first loss since the late 1980s - Pounds 8.7m before tax . Mr Geoffrey Whalen , Peugeot Talbot deputy chairman , said there was little early prospect of more jobs at the Ryton plant itself , which employs 3,000 people . This is because it has maintained double-shift working - with downtime and temporary lay-offs - in spite of the slump in UK and continental European markets which caused Ryton 's output to fall from a peak 116,000 units in 1990 . By keeping the workforce intact , Ryton retains its capacity to make 120,000 cars a year . Even with the saloon 306 , Ryton is unlikely to be utilising its full capacity unless export demand for both 306 models expands considerably . Mr Whalen said there were no plans to reintroduce the larger 405 saloon - or its successor to be launched in France next year - to Ryton 's assembly lines alongside the 306 models . The 405 , a big success in the UK fleet market , accounted for most of Ryton 's production until the Continental market slump led Peugeot to confine 405 output to France at the end of 1992 .
