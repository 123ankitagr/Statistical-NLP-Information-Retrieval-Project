on the highsociety block where soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and his wife raisa will sleep tonight the neighbors and their help know all about the demands of security at stanford university where gorbachev will speak monday students are taking the metal detectors and other precautions in stride so anxious are they to get a glimpse of the soviet leader and his wife with gorbachevs 845 pm arrival drawing near hammerand sickle flags flap in the san francisco bay breeze vendors peddle tshirts and us law enforcement authorities are polishing up their plans to encase the soviet leader in the tightest security possible for the past 10 days us secret service agents have been walking the routes the gorbachevs will travel and have told residents in the pacific heights neighborhood where the couple will be staying to keep away from their windows and off their roofs lest they be mistaken for snipers during the next two days the secret service will be responsible for ensuring the safety of 10 protectees all of them past or present leaders of nations and high government officials in addition to gorbachev the secret service must protect former president ronald reagan for instance who will have breakfast with the soviet leader at the consul generals home and south korean president roh tae woo who is scheduled to meet gorbachev on monday logistically it is a little bit more work richard mcdrew special agent in charge of the secret service in san francisco said of rohs visit announced last week then he amended the comment the visit by the south korean leader means a lot more work mcdrew is a veteran of visits by presidents pope john paul ii in 1987 and queen elizabeth ii in 1983 i dont want to say it is routine but it is standard he said noting that he simply requested extra armored limousines and agents from other offices to help with such functions as communications and bomb sweeping the secret service is the us agency responsible for protecting foreign leaders on this occasion the secret service will share the task with agents of the soviet kgb and south korean security agents nobody identifies themselves as kgb said robert freelen stanfords vice president for public affairs they just say theyre soviet security they strike me as typical policemen who are interested in things they should be interested in the secret service and kgb will be assisted by agencies ranging from the fbi to the california highway patrol as well as by police in san francisco palo alto and stanford and security officers at the fairmont hotel in san francisco law enforcement officials would not say how much the policing would cost or how many would be involved no one involved in the security planning seemed especially worried as they explained how traffic will be slowed whenever gorbachevs 30car motorcade travels down normally clogged freeways or how demonstrators will be kept at bay or how hundreds of people will be herded through metal detectors before hearing the soviet leader speak weve had a lot of celebrities and expresidents before said jim mccarthy head of security at the fairmont hotel where gorbachev will speak on monday and meet privately with roh the gorbachevs will stay at soviet consul general valentin kamenevs home a pacific heights mansion monitored by a video camera and ringed by a wroughtiron fence on what may be san franciscos toniest block the 2800 block of broadway a few doors away lives a member of the family that owns levi strauss a getty lives a few doors down in the other direction pacific gas electric workers checked for leaking gas lines in front of the home late last week pacific bell worker paul bowman asked saturday what he was doing with phone lines outside the consul generals home replied its secret the street will be barricaded during the visit residents will have to park on nearby streets and walk home guards will check residents identification before letting them pass security precautions are nothing new on the block hilda gotcher secretary to dodie rosekrans a nextdoor neighbor of kamenev noted that not long ago the family hosted a fundraiser attended by former secretary of state henry a kissinger any inconvenience will be of little bother to rosekrans she is cochairwoman of friends of raisa gorbachev and one of four people from the group scheduled to meet with mrs gorbachev at the kamenev residence monday afternoon after breakfast with the reagans the gorbachevs will head to stanford 35 miles south the trip will give the soviets a chance to visit the silicon valley an area few of their fellow citizens have seen at least not openly the university does no classified work but the us government has declared much of the silicon valley offlimits to soviets because of the many defense contractors and companies there that develop technology coveted by moscow counterintelligence experts assume that during state visits most spying ceases soviet agents will be busy protecting their leader and probably wont have time to gather intelligence noted david w szady head of the fbis unit responsible for combatting soviet spying in the bay area im sure they wouldnt want something to happen that would be an embarrassment szady said embarrassments thats what everybody protects against at stanford officials issued tickets friday to several thousand students and staff members to see gorbachev arrive in the quadrangle monday morning the quad will be closed in the hours before the arrival the business school where gorbachev will meet with selected students and faculty also will be
