you can buy a set of grainy blackandwhite postcards with the joke title 12 reasons why not to move to seattle in the more progressive bookstores of this beautiful economically buoyant and civilised city the cards which purport to show extremely unflattering pictures of the area are meant to be sent by seattleites to friends or relatives in other parts of the us who might be thinking of moving to the city the aim is to put them off joining the wave of humanity which has swept into the puget sound region over the past few years as its economy has surged but the joke also makes a serious point the growth and immigration of the past decade have created substantial developmental problems for seattle and the surrounding fourcounty puget sound region which together account for half washington states economic output the danger is that unless the region takes control of the change it could end up losing the very quality which is attracting new immigrants and business to the area its extremely attractive lifestyle that said the economic boom of the 1980s has now given way to a slower pace of growth seattle has fared much better than the rest of the us in the recession of 19912 and analysts suggest that its growth will still outpace the national average during the 1990s but only just in other words the region is not so economically secure that it can afford to take growth for granted it remains highly dependent on boeing the worlds largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and to a lesser extent on the timber logging which first brought it prosperity in the 19th century boeing which has its headquarters just south of seattle and is by far the regions largest employer seems set to enjoy strong longterm growth yet there are doubts about its shortterm business outlook and local businessmen still recall the dark recessionary days of the boeing bust in the early 1970s the timber industry for its part is contracting as environmentalists initiatives to save the northern spotted owl restrict the supply of logs other growth industries will offset these trends notably the computer software sector centred on microsoft which has its headquarters in a seattle suburb important too will be the regions growing importance as a shipping and airline entrepot midway between europe and the far east but finding a balance between encouraging growth and restraining it will be far from easy its a very delicate act but it has to be done because the quality of life is partly what brings people here says mr paul sommers research director at the university of washingtons northwest policy center and the balancing act is causing no little friction between slowgrowth environmentalists and fasttrack industrialists between property owners threatened by development restrictions and planning authorities between the city of seattle and its surrounding middleclass suburbs and not least between old residents socalled lesser seattleites who dislike the changes in their city and the newcomers many of them refugees from recessionhit environmentallytroubled california but it is at least encouraging amid all this heat that the community is tackling such issues headon alarmed by the urban sprawl created in the late 1980s the washington state legislature passed a growth management act in 1990 which requires all cities and counties to draw up development plans which define urban boundaries and create a coherent consistent development plan mr norm rice seattles popular black mayor recently unveiled proposals for the city designed to relieve pressure on the urban fringe partly by winning back middleclass people lost to the surrounding suburbs he envisages a series of urban villages developed along the route of a proposed masstransit system we can either take control of growth and channel it in ways which will enhance our community or we can sit on our hands and watch unmanaged growth destroy all of the things we value about seattle and the puget sound region the mayor said seattle adds a regional planner is still in the fortunate position of being able to avoid the mistakes made by virtually every other major us city if there is a degree of smugness about that remark it is understandable for more than a decade now seattle has been picking up awards as the most liveable city in the us one of the best places to do business to raise children and even americas top city for bicycling this is in large measure because of the sheer beauty of its physical surroundings it is bounded on two sides by water puget sound to the west and lake washington to the east and on three sides by mountains in spite of its rainy climate it offers more accessible outdoor recreation than any other us centre of comparable size seattle itself is architecturally undistinguished yet it has a very attractive atmosphere its setting on steep hills next to water gives it a character vaguely reminiscent of san francisco its downtown centre is simultaneously small enough to be manageable and large enough to be reasonably sophisticated it boasts an absurd number of espresso coffee shops some interesting northwestern cuisine excellent bookshops and a plethora of art galleries headed by the new architecturally bold seattle art museum somewhat improbably it has also become the undisputed centre of pop musics latest craze grungerock rolling stone magazine has just named the city the new liverpool nevertheless seattle remains neat clean and unflashy enjoying its newfound wealth without flaunting it this is a city of inconspicuous consumption as one local writer puts it prosperity has also changed seattles view of itself and americas view of the city thirty years ago it was widely regarded as a dull provincial backwater physically isolated from the rest of the country and heavily influenced by a dour scandinavian heritage sir thomas beecham the british composer called it a cultural dustbin today it is seen as increasingly cosmopolitan be it in terms of culture outlook or racial mix in 1960 just 8 per cent of the citys population was made up of minorities but the figure is now 25 per cent thanks to strong immigration during the 1980s by asians who now account for 11 per cent of the population throughout its history seattle has looked to asia for trade and cultural ties and has developed unusually strong links with japan underlined recently when a consortium led by nintendo the japanese games company with its us headquarters in seattle made a takeover bid for the citys baseball team these links could prove increasingly important over the next decade as the city aggressively markets its role as an eastwest trading centre yet seattle is hardly shangrila it has a high rate of violent crime drugs and aids problems homelessness the term skid row originated here in the 19th century traffic congestion and concern over the quality of its air and education however many of these problems seem more manageable or managed better than in many other us cities for example seattles initiatives for keeping the homeless off the streets involving a broad range of civic groups have been widely praised this sense of community is underlined in city politics which involves a high degree of policy input from strong neighbourhood interest groups significantly all city elections are by law nonpartisan in nature although for the past two decades every mayor has been a member of the democratic party however the mushrooming of suburbs in counties beyond the city limits means that no amount of civic togetherness will allow seattle alone to solve those pressing questions which require regional solutions among the most important of these are a host of interrelated transport problems including decisions on a new regional rail system and whether or not to build a new runway at seatac airport seattle is hardly alone among american conurbations in grappling with regional issues that transcend neat political boundaries but because the region remains relatively unspoilt rather more hangs on it finding sensible solutions
