Jesse Jackson has told political supporters that he does not intend to run for mayor of the nation 's capital this fall and will make a formal announcement this week , associates said Friday . `` He 's not going to run for mayor of Washington . We talked about it yesterday , '' Joel Ferguson , who managed Jackson 's 1988 presidential campaign in Michigan , told a Lansing , Mich. , television station Friday . Jackson , a two-time Democratic presidential contender , was en route to Chicago on Friday evening and could not be reached for comment . Jackson has said his recent campaign to gain statehood for the District of Columbia will remain his priority . A top Jackson aide , Frank Watkins , refused to discuss Jackson 's decision on the mayoral race . Ferguson estimated the chance that Jackson would run at only 10 % , but a supporter here said Jackson told him flatly that he would not run . `` Jesse is out , '' said the supporter , who spoke only on condition of anonymity . `` He has decided that it would be wrong for him to get into the race at this time , or at all . '' Jackson 's political plans have been the subject of speculation since he moved to the nation 's capital in April . That speculation intensified with Mayor Marion Barry 's arrest last month on a cocaine-possession charge . Barry is at a South Carolina hospital for treatment for what an aide has called an alcohol problem . City Administrator Carol Thompson is in charge in Barry 's absence . Jackson 's reported decision comes amid growing signs that voters -- and politicians -- are wary of a Jackson mayoral bid . A Washington Post poll released last week reported that Jackson would trail Barry if both were candidates in the September Democratic primary . Jackson has repeatedly refused to rule out a run for Barry 's job , saying he would seek the office only if Barry , a colleague in the civil rights battle , did not run for a fourth term .
