on washing days when i was young a favourite game was to burrow inside the sheets blowing on the line close my eyes and spirit myself to some faraway land of exotic foreign playmates nowadays neither imagination nor windbillowing sheets are necessary instead late at night when realworld friends are sleeping i make a coffee and sit at my desktop computer in boston us to begin travels in the virtual world which may take me anywhere from an aid organisation in bombay to a research station atop a volcano in hawaii across the globe millions are engaged in heated online discussion of everything from politics to elvis sightings swopping travel or business tips or even conducting love affairs with people they have never met we are users of internet the worldwide web of computer networks and electronic message email systems its proliferation looks set to be as important to the 1990s as the spread of personal computers was to the 1980s and has enormous social and political implications since access opened to the public two years ago an estimated 20m people from 60 countries have subscribed to this peculiar world with its own language culture and rules of behaviour or netiquette according to figures released in december at the internet world 93 conference 150000 or more log on each month in the us no business card is complete without an email address in general users are not computer nerds or social misfits who prefer communicating with a screen rather than a person they are ordinary people seeking electronic soul mates to meet online without barriers of racism sexism or age without facing crime on the streets and with whom they can form a community to compensate for the fragmentation of family and society in the virtual community howard rheingold writes of the phenomenon perhaps cyberspace is one of the informal public places where people can rebuild aspects of the community lost when the small shop became an outoftown mall while taking part in the worlds largest ongoing conversation may make people feel good and enable them to learn about other cultures and garner information the implications are far larger a system that gives direct access to an educated population equivalent to more than twice that of portugal and multiplying clearly has tremendous political and commercial potential internet advocates believe its spread will boost grassroots participation in public policy rheingold describes it as an electronic agora the marketplace in athenian democracy where citizens met to debate president bill clinton the first head of state to go online says increasing electronic access between the public and the administration will revitalise citizenbased democracy all white house press releases and proposals are fed into the system and the administration aims to provide computers in libraries town halls and shopping malls from which people can vent their views vicepresident al gore has even held an internet press conference sitting at the keyboard and messaging the us president gives a sense of empowerment which some find overwhelming at the computer museum in boston where an exhibit allows visitors to send email to bill i watched one voluble character rendered wordless at the keyboard typing only dear mr president how are you geoffrey of course clinton is not sitting at his screen personally replying to the 1000 email messages he receives each day but white house officials insist that everyone gets a reply after appropriate consideration democrats are not the only ones to spot internets potential the republican party executive went online last month with an electronic newsletter and instant rebuttals and counterproposals to clinton speeches marty connors director of the exchange foundation a republican think tank has elaborated a plan called governnet to improve governance by enabling mayors in different cities to swap ideas and giving people direct access to party bosses he envisages internet becoming an essential part of election strategy i see it as perhaps the political tool of the future at least as important as mailshots and phone campaigning the idea of reaching households directly with my message unfiltered is very attractive a council officer in sunnyvale california was elected after campaigning almost entirely on internet others are less convinced of the benefits samuel huntington director of the olin institute at harvard university warns we are in danger of creating a twoclass society those who are part of the information technology revolution and those who are not can you train a whole society to be computer literate for those with access to a computer and modem getting on to internet is fairly cheap less than dollars 20 pounds 13 a month for an hour a day in europe and north america but it is about as userfriendly as the roads in birminghams spaghetti junction and first steps in cyberspace can be daunting in his book the whole internet ed kroll compares it to grabbing a handful of jello the firmer your grasp the more oozes down your arm internet has three main uses the first is email electronic messages that are far cheaper than longdistance telephone calls and faster than the post or snailmail as net users call it second it functions as a public bulletin board on which one can read and post messages in 2500 discussion groups on everything from outofbody experiences to the best way to clean an aquarium there are groups of subjects under eight main headings such as alt for alternative biz for business comp for computerrelated matters and rec for recreational activities it is like being able to wander into a series of pubs in which conversations are underway except this one never closes finally internet can be used to retrieve information from distant locations that days supreme court rulings the encyclopaedia britannica and the complete works of shakespeare are all online satellite weather maps or entire books can be downloaded in minutes the only way to start is to dig in a cybervirgin i had been impressed by a cocktail encounter with a graduate student of economics at the massachusetts institute of technology he told me that he had posted questions from a tough takehome exam on the net and soon had economists the world over working on the solutions earning him top marks so when my mother told me she would like a cd for christmas of bachs concerto for 2 violins i hit the m button late one night to mail a message into rec music classical asking for suggestions of the best recording when i signed on the next morning i had 40 suggestions unfortunately all different inspired by this success i trailed through and found i could get all the latest news from latin america where i lived until recently follow scandals in the beleaguered conservative government back home in the uk or read about the hottest jazz clubs in new york for a while i was a passive wanderer enjoying other peoples exchanges such as those in alt fan british accent where british users tried to explain to a man from illinois how his ancestors from bedford would have pronounced words such as mirror another favourite is alt good morning which tries to brighten the day wednesdays mailings included a poem a warning from a finnish user not to walk on the ice to catch fish some lyrics from rock band the cure and a riddle about the number of people with more than two arms growing more cyberhappy i began posting particularly after discovering the intriguing alt history what if group which discusses issues such as what would have happened if the south had won the civil war in the us to compensate for the absence of body language various conventions have developed laughter is represented by while means the author got out of bed the wrong side writing in capitals is the net equivalent of shouting soon i was experiencing my first electronic pickup line from an aspiring actor in california wishing to discuss arthurian legends it began i am 6ft with curly golden hair and drive a red corvette the internet is full of people hoping to discover email love david weinstein a 32yearold software designer from boston was using the net to keep up with developments in his business when he came across alt personals the electronic equivalent of pasting loveletters on a public notice board he says i was lonely and having difficulty meeting jewish girls so i placed some ads it seemed very public so i made them anonymous that didnt work so i sent some stories about dating his stories attracted the attention of michele schneiderman a 29yearold teacher from columbus ohio and four months later they were sharing a cabin on a caribbean cruise not all email love stories have happy endings a notorious frenchman posed as a woman onscreen carrying on a series of netromances before being exposed for many their desktop screen has become a shoulder to cry on forums have evolved for aids and cancer sufferers for those undergoing divorce and victims of rape or abuse one user told me internet saved my marriage by being able to talk to others in the same situation another said internet is a drug you can pour your heart out to people youll never meet its like a practice zone for reallife the net has tremendous practical uses teachers in remote areas can compare lesson plans and academics can swap research findings diane williams of the technology in education project at harvard graduate school says through internet i have been able to discuss ideas with colleagues in milan tasmania and london and get existing models which i can then adapt she believes internet will soon offer virtual classrooms for rural or homebound students businessmen find it invaluable for comparing conditions in china exploring investment partners swapping tips on office management and even marketing products describing internet as the worlds largest adhocracy oliver strimpel executive director of the computer museum says we are seeing a fundamental change in the nature and control of information ironically for something so anarchic its origins lie in military thinking it was developed as a communications network for the pentagon able to withstand nuclear attack it has no central command and messages are chopped into small packets of data routed by the network then reassembled at their destination if any part of the system is wiped out the message simply takes another route during the attempted putsch against gorbachev in 1991 its russian counterpart glasnet kept feeding information to the west and proved impossible for the coups perpetrators to block while this lack of any central hierarchy there is no internet inc is in some sense its glory it also means there is no one to take responsibility for abuses or the proliferation of pornography this month a boston man was charged with abducting a young boy he is alleged to have lured through internet there is another concern cables which bring information into the home can also take it out marc rotenberg of washingtonbased computer professionals for social responsibility says while internet is a great opportunity we are worried about the potential loss of privacy and the orwellian spectre that government could monitor all communication his organisation is fighting us government proposals which would enable federal agencies to wiretap the information infrastructure without needing court orders as the precursor of the interactive world of the muchheralded information superhighway it is not clear what the final shape of internet will be as federal funding is phased out it will probably be privatised but with the price of hardware tumbling and governments expected to force cable companies to provide cheap access the most lucrative profits are likely to accrue to those feeding in material a plethora of online services are springing up involving publishers such as rupert murdoch stores such as sears roebuck which see great potential for advertising their products and telecommunication giants and computer companies such as ibm and apple many newspapers are going online too the san jose mercury usa today and the washington post one
