in the aftermath of the first world war there could hardly have been a worse name for a company operating in france than bosch the word boche which means rascal had become a term of abuse for germans yet the french bought robert bosch engines and pumps regardless equally rentokil is about as bad a name as you could think of for a company trying to make it in healthcare and in tropical plants yet that name is here to stay on this page last week chief executive clive thompson explained that he had shunned the advice of image consultants to rename his company rentokil he said has a reputation that transcends any association with hired assassins and is too entrenched now to discard so whats in a name does it matter what a company calls itself if you have a bad name you can still have a successful company says wally olins who has made a handsome living out of dreaming up new names for companies but it is easier for a company if it has a name that helps it however good or bad its name a company needs a powerful reason to change once it has taken root english china clays like many other longestablished businesses found its name had been overtaken by events as the company was no longer mainly in england nor mainly in china clays it decided to drop the words and use initials instead however as the outside world persisted in calling it ecc formerly english china clays the company eventually gave up and reverted to its full title according to adrian day a senior consultant at siegel and gale the communications consultancy companies wanting a new name no longer reach automatically for initials not only have most combinations of two or three letters already been taken but companies are discovering that establishing a new identity around meaningless initials can be expensive it takes a lot of time and expenditure to make them mean something he says even when the new name is a real word it may be a struggle to get it accepted when woolworths became kingfisher shareholders at its annual meeting became so agitated the company had to call in the police the management however felt that woolworths had become a misleading name as it owned more businesses than just that chain not all companies think it matters if they have the same name as one of their brands indeed some think it an advantage consolidated foods the us consumer goods company changed its name to sara lee in the hope that the goodwill associated with that brand would rub off on the whole company the most pressing reason for a new name is that the old one has become sullied thus ratners the uk highstreet jeweller has recently become signet control securities the property and leisure company whose former chairman and chief executive has been charged in connection with the bcci case has started a new life as ascot holdings new names come in all shapes and sizes they also come at all prices at one extreme british telecom is estimated to have spent some pounds 50m letting wolff olins the consultancy transform it into bt at the other control securities and ratners spent little more than the cost of reprinting their stationery the name signet simply occurred to a ratners manager one day he put it to his colleagues they liked it and that was that control securities new name was even simpler ascot was the name of a shell company it owned by contrast 25 people and a computer working flat out at image consultancy interbrand for 14 weeks were required to come up with a new name for icis pharmaceuticals offshoot the name zeneca might seem scant reward for all that effort yet interbrands paul stobart explains that choosing a name is more difficult than it might appear nearly all the obvious ones have already been taken moreover the more markets a company is in and the more countries the more difficult it is to find an available name a list of 1000 possibles was checked against six trademark groups in more than 30 countries then the foreign language experts had to eliminate anything that was rude or indiscreet in a foreign language the next stage was to present the company with a shortlist people get very emotional about names ici was professional about it but some companies can be a real nightmare says stobart ici decided on zeneca because the zen part has associations with zenith to give the name extra significance the company explains that a little cross was added to the z to make it resemble the alchemy symbol meaning to solve such clever twists may be lost on the average consumer of pharmaceutical products to whom one computergenerated name may be as good as any other yet experts can distinguish between names just as winetasters can pick out different vintages the way the name appears the sound and texture of it when spoken the symmetry of it are all important the word needs to have a good look and appeal with nothing that is ugly or difficult to pronounce says stobart in choosing a name such as zeneca ici has gone for the industry norm in pharmaceuticals unusual names such as glaxo are common in other industries different rules apply advertising agencies and most professional firms call themselves after their partners the more names the better hairdressers can not resist jokes headmasters curl up and dye crops and bobbers and so on puns are also acceptable for opticians for eyes is a market leader and bathroom shops but greengrocers and butchers stick to sensible names like high class butchers says olins most people in any industry do what the peer group dictates anyone who breaks out will not be on their own for long in the computer industry ibm set the standard and was followed by lookalike names such as icl then came apple which was deliberately daring to be different it was followed by apricot and an orchard of computer companies why are fruits like computers asks olins because someone did it once despite all the effort that goes into getting a name right many of the best names have been created by accident one of days favourites is virgin atlantic the lesson is perhaps that anyone trying to name an airline should think of a good name for an alternative record company and take it from there
