International Ice Hockey Federation officials said hockey could be pulled from the 1992 Winter Olympics if the issue over playing facilities is not resolved . `` It 's possible that we wo n't take part in the Olympic tournament , '' IIHF President Gunther Sabetzki said . `` We are not prepared to have the Olympic tournament played in one place . '' French organizers at Albertville at first promised to build two arenas for the Olympic tournament . But they said in September that they wanted to hold the games in an existing arena in neighboring Meribel , and use a small arena in Courchevel , another Alpine resort , only for practice .
