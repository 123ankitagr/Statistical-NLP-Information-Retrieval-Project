High water levels of the Ohio River caused organizers today to postpone the Thunder on the Ohio unlimited hydroplane race scheduled this weekend . It is the first time since 1981 that the race has been postponed . Under the revised schedule , qualifying will be conducted July 7 and 8 , and racing will begin at noon on July 9 . Jan Theubach , director of the Freedom Festival , said the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has projected that the river will crest at 35.7 feet on Thursday , the day before qualifying was to have begun . `` If the river is higher than 22 feet , we ca n't hold the race , '' Theubach said . The problem is not that the river is too deep , she explained . `` It 's the pits , that 's all , '' she said . `` The crews have to be able to set the cranes out , and if the concrete 's under water , you ca n't set the cranes out .
