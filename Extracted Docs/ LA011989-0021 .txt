Director Alan Parker , who has two Golden Globe award nominations for `` Mississippi Burning , '' has signed a three-year production and development agreement with Tri-Star Pictures . Tri-Star will have exclusive , first-look rights to film projects that Parker develops . The deal also enables Parker to undertake `` personal projects at modest budgets , '' Tri-Star said Wednesday . Although `` Mississippi Burning '' is an Orion release , Tri-Star distributed Parker 's controversial 1987 film `` Angel Heart . '' Parker also has plans to direct a film version of `` Les Miserables '' for the studio . ALEENE MacMINN
