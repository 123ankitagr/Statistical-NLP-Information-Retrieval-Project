Volkswagen , the German car maker , has fallen out with its Japanese importer , Yanase , which said yesterday it would stop handling Volkswagen and Audi models at the end of the year . The decision by Yanase threatens to disrupt Volkswagen sales in Japan , where Volkswagen claims the largest share of imported cars . Volkswagen , however , has been expanding its own sales outlets . It has also begun to sell through Toyota dealers and may be in position to bounce back . Yanase , Japan 's biggest imported car dealer , was unhappy at the prospect of losing its near-exclusive sales of Volkswagen models and will attempt to replace Volkswagen sales with other cars , possibly from Opel the German subsidiary of General Motors .
