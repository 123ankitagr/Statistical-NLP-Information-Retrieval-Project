many homeowners do not realize that one of the best spinoffs of the electronic revolution for home security is a motionsensing light switch that automatically turns on the lights only when a person or automobile approaches the property and then turns them off after a one to fiveminute interval the switches can be adapted to most existing outdoor light fixtures or can be purchased as a complete set with flood lamp sockets that can be installed to replace virtually any existing outdoor light fixture without new wiring in the front of the house or on the side or back motion sensor lights can be placed anywhere that security lighting is desirable without the added expense of burning several hundred watts of light all night long and without the problem of bright lights eliciting complaints from neighbors the motion sensor switches come with a sensitivity adjustment knob to allow a range of up to 75 feet the amount of time the lights remain on is adjustable too normally ranging from one to five minutes the switches also employ a photoelectric cell to assure light activation only during hours of darkness motion sensor light switches and complete fixtures are now sold at most major hardware stores and home centers prices vary from store to store but a complete motion sensor light fixture can usually be found for under $ 75 the motion sensor switches and complete fixtures are designed for relatively easy doityourself installation when installed into an existing junction box that is already wired the typical homeowner can hook it up in less than an hour installation instructions are very clear with the new sensor light hooked up to replace an existing light fixture simply leave the inside light switch in the on position to have the lights working automatically if you are having a party or want the lights to remain on to illuminate a driveway basketball court for example normal body motion will keep them lit without interruption
