right after he won his first game as manager of the new york yankees stump merrill rushed to shake hands with an old friend dave righetti it was appropriate that righetti was the one to preserve the yankees 52 victory over the baltimore orioles sunday at baltimore because he and merrill worked together in doublea ball at west haven in the late 1970s hes the perfect guy to close it out for me merrill said he started with me when i started my career when i brought him in today thats what went through my mind that he would get the save of my first win righetti gave up one hit in the ninth inning to earn his 11th save and help the yankees end an eightgame losing streak he also appreciated the irony of the situation ive known him for a long time and hes earned his way up here righetti said a lot of people are making fun of us because the yankees arent doing well and they make a change and bring in a guy by the name of stump but hes earned the job and deserves to be here after merrill took over for bucky dent on wednesday new york had lost twice to boston and twice to the orioles to say merrill enjoyed the victory is a vast understatement now we can relax and play some baseball merrill said every time i turned around someone was asking me when the streak was going to end well its behind us merrill isnt the only person who will always remember the day baltimore shortstop cal ripken jr played in his 1307th straight game putting him in a tie for second with everett scott behind lou gehrig 2130 games on baseballs alltime list of consecutive games played i didnt set out to play in this many ripken said my main goal was to just go out and play every day when i got to the big leagues the most you can play is 162 and then you get four months off like everybody else ripken added its a streak of consecutive years of playing every game not a streak of 1300 games the orioles who had been at 500 for the first time since april 24 saw their fourgame winning streak end baltimore entered the game having won seven of eight and 11 of 15 oakland 3 kansas city 2 bob welch settled down after a shaky start to win his sixth consecutive decision and the athletics
