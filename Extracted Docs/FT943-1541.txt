CRH , the Dublin-based construction and building materials group , has bought Rotondo for Dollars 22.5m ( Pounds 14.2m ) in cash including assumed debt . Rotondo is the leading supplier of precast concrete enclosures to telephone and utility companies in the north east of the US . It is also a major national supplier of precast concrete prison cells . In the US , CRH 's operations are organised under its holding company Oldcastle , into four core business groups : architectural products , materials , glass and precast . The Precast Group is a major supplier of precast telecommunication , utility and environmental products in the Western and south-eastern US . Mr Myles Lee , general manager-finance , said the acquisition would extend the geographical coverage of CRH 's precast operations in the US . CRH already had substantial precast activities in the west and south of the US , but wants to increase its presence in the north , he said . Mr Jim Schack , president of the CRH 's precast group , said that the synergies of bringing Rotondo and the Precast Group together involved not only products and territories , but also the sharing of Rotondo 's engineering and production know-how with the group 's other facilities in the US and internationally . CRH 's shares closed up 3p at 361p .
