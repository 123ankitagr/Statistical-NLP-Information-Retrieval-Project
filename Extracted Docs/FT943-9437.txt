sir in their otherwise admirably informative review of the current developments in nuclear proliferation and its control tick tick tick tick them off august 5 jimmy burns and bronwen maddox make two presentational errors that deserve correction first in the accompanying map on the spread of nuclear weapons capability they entirely overlook canadas significant nuclear infrastructure according to the 1994 edition of nuclear engineering internationals world nuclear industry handbook canada has 22 nuclear reactors operating at seven different sites additionally it has a nuclear research centre at chalk river where scientists worked on the manhattan atomic bomb project whose technically successful outcome has just been marked with the 49th anniversary of the atomic destruction of hiroshima and nagasaki canada also has very significant uranium deposits as has australia a country identified as having large civil nuclear capability although it only has two small research reactors and no commercial reactors planned or operating second your specialist writers misrepresent the text of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt in saying that it permits five countries to have nuclear weapons programmes it does not the npt text defines a nuclear weapons state as one which has demonstrably tested a nuclear weapon which interestingly itself remains undefined in the treaty by january 1967 it is to conflate the definition of a nuclear weapons state with the proposition that the npt permits such a status where both your authors and the foreign office are inaccurate indeed under article vi of the npt each of the states party to the treaty including the nuclear weapons states are committed to entering into negotiations in good faith and at an early date towards nuclear disarmament under strict and verifiable international control this is hardly a permissive commitment to the retention of nuclear weapons david lowry visiting research fellow the open university walton hall milton keynes mk7 6aa
