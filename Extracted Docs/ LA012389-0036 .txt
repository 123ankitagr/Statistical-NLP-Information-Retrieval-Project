Frigid temperatures have stopped people cold across Alaska , where a dozen towns were locked up in the minus 50s and minus 60s , and the temperature hit 70 below zero at a truck stop in Coldfoot , on the trans-Alaska oil pipeline supply road . Even high temperatures were well below zero in most of Alaska , and temperatures were so low that much of the state has gone into hibernation . Planes that carry mail , groceries and people to numerous outlying villages have been grounded by extreme cold and , in some places , by ice fog -- dense fog formed by ice crystals .
