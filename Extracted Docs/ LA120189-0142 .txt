In a November sweeps period where special episodes of regular series supplanted expensive , long-form miniseries as the way to attract viewers , top-ranked NBC scored an unsurprising win . Outranking the other networks during the crucial period when stations measure their ratings for advertisers , NBC came in first , ABC second and CBS third in the fall sweeps . `` Our win was based on our regular schedule , with little 'stunting ' or preemptions , '' Robert Niles , NBC vice president of research , noted at a news conference here . `` With the performance of our regular series , multiple-part miniseries have to pass a hurdle with us . '' For the four-week period , NBC averaged a 15.1 rating and a 25 share of the audience , while ABC posted a 13 rating and a 21 share , and CBS had a 12 rating and a 20 share . A Nielsen rating point represents 921,000 households . There were no multiple-part miniseries and only three two-parters broadcast during the November ratings period . ABC 's docudrama `` Small Sacrifices '' was the big hit among the miniseries , with a 21.7 rating and a 34 share of the audience . NBC 's `` Cross of Fire '' had a 13.6 rating and 22 share . CBS ' `` Till We Meet Again '' had a 12.9 rating and a 20 share . Overall viewing levels were off slightly from the November sweeps a year ago , but the networks ' combined share of the prime-time audience remained at 66 % . `` While there is network erosion , it tends to come off shows at the bottom of the ratings , '' Niles said .
