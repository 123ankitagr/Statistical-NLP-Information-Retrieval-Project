WOOLWORTH Corporation yesterday named Mr William Lavin as chairman and chief executive to replace Mr Harold Sells when he retires , at the age of 65 , in July . Mr Lavin , 48 , has served as the US retailer 's chief financial officer since 1991 . He joined Woolworth in 1981 as an assistant controller . On Wall Street , shares in Woolworth rose Dollars 5/8 to Dollars 29 3/4 . An announcement about Mr Sells successor has been expected since September , when a Securities and Exchange Commission filing showed Mr Sells had sold Dollars 3.4m of stock in the company . Woolworth said then the move was in preparation for his retirement . Mr Sells , who became Woolworth 's chief executive in 1983 , began his career working for Kinney Shoe in 1945 . Kinney is now a division of Woolworth . Woolworth said it has changed the organisational structures of its FW Woolworth and Kinney Shoe units . FW Woolworth will now run Rx Place , a deep-discount drug store chain which had been operated as a separate unit . Kinney Shoe will run the Little Folk Shop and Kids Mart children 's apparel stores .
