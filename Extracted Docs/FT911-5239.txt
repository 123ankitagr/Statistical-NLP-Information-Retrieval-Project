britain's motorists could be made to pay for using congested roads under proposals being considered by the government in the next few weeks mr malcolm rifkind the transport secretary will announce that he is to consider a pay-as-you go charging system as part of a fundamental shift in approach to solving britain's growing traffic problems cars and lorries could be fitted with electronic devices to interact with roadside monitors charging according to mileage time of day and type of vehicle this system known as road pricing is regarded by transport economists the main opposition parties and a range of other bodies as offering the most realistic long-term solution to britain's growing road congestion problems under mrs margaret thatcher's leadership the government rejected road pricing as an unnecessary and politically unacceptable infringement of motorists freedom the re-think initiated by mr john major since he became prime minister has opened the way for more sympathetic consideration of the idea mr rifkind is looking at road pricing as a way of dealing with traffic volumes forecast by the transport department to rise by between 83 per cent and 142 per cent by the year 2025 mr rifkind believes the transport department's forecasts for traffic growth cannot be accommodated with road building and measures have to be introduced to deter motorists from driving particularly in urban areas and the densely-populated south-east while increased investment in the railway system could help mr rifkind considers that british rail's small share of the passenger travel market about 7 per cent of passenger miles means this can form only part of the solution he has therefore asked departmental officials to study the feasibility of rationing road space through a pricing system and to suggest ways in which it could be introduced at present the only country operating a road pricing system is singapore where motorists driving into the city at busy times have to buy permits and display them on their windscreens other densely populated countries such as the netherlands are considering the introduction of electronic road pricing systems and in the uk cambridge is working on plans for a city scheme mr rifkind's acknowledgement that traffic growth cannot be accommodated by road building could have wider implications for the transport department's construction programme at present the department's forecasts are used to support its case for new roads if it accepts that this growth cannot materialise its case for some schemes particularly environmentally sensitive ones may be weakened letters tackling traffic growth page 10
