the wedding banquet 15 ang lee sleepless in seattle pg nora ephron the fugitive 12 andrew davis boiling point 15 james b harris in the soup 15 alexandre rockwell by nigel andrews cinemas pr industry has its own form of shotgun wedding when it likes the sound of two words together it forces them to unite for life thirty years ago wordmarriages like spinechilling bloodcurdling and ribtickling were the stuff of promo language large with hyperbole armed with the warheads of exclamation marks they hurtled out from the screen towards us in movie trailers todays favourite compound more suited to an age of psychobabble and postyuppyism is feelgood but what are feelgood movies short answer the wedding banquet and sleepless in seattle are they present human problems and then they fix them they ask you to believe that people are fundamentally loving and warm they have happy endings and they are the disposabletissue industrys best friend the worst feelgood movies can also make you feel cheated your tears or cheers wrung by a form of emotional armwrestling using music plot contrivance limpideyed stars and if possible a dog but there are no dogs in the wedding banquet and sleepless in seattle two of the best romantic comedies in recent memory and there is enough sour wit and credible crossaccident to make any lastreel handkerchiefreaching feel well earned the first movie won the golden bear at berlin this year the hero winston chao is taiwaneseamerican just like the film and lives prosperously in new york he devotes half his emotional energies to his native gay lover mitchell lichtenstein the other half to parrying parental postcards from taipei urging marriage when pa and ma turn up in person for a twoweek visit the lovers stash away the gay calendars masquerade as flatsharers and recruit a taiwanese girl painter who wants a green card to stay in america for a letsmakethefolkshappy wedding writerdirector ang lee scarcely sounds a false note things go right in the story only after they have spent a proper amount of time going wrong for much of the movie the heros parentdeterring subterfuges backfire as when he fills in a computer marriage form they have sent and lists a nearimpossible blend of specifications in his bride two doctorate degrees five languages an opera singing career only for a suitable candidate to turn up on the next plane she bursts into madam butterfly right there at the east river cafe soon she has been put on the next plane out around the wedding itself the comic setpieces are scattered like confetti a registry ceremony with the foreignborn bride ever more bewildered in her responses for better for richer till sickness and death a gay best man lichtenstein making sure his friends lips are wiped after each kiss and games of musical woks back home in the kitchen here the gay lover conscious of appearances leaps away from the stove whenever the parents pass through pushing artistbride plus wooden spoon into the steam the films final accelerando of disaster including pregnancy and parental truthlearning keeps the story piquant and perilous even as the almost happy ending looms sleepless in seattle also spends furlongs of footage working to deserve its feelgood factor here is a romance between a boy and girl who never meet well they might meet in the final minutes but why should i spoil your fun by specifying whether they do whether seattle widower tom hanks and baltimore penfriend meg ryan actually fulfil their mooted valentines day tryst atop the empire state building only hankss small son ross malinger has really tried to make it work he first set the two hearts fluttering by pushing lonely dad into a radio agony phonein where he bared his soul to a listening world including 3000 miles away in a car the captivated ryan director and cowriter nora ephron manhandles david twohys original story into a semblance of her own sweetandsour romance when harry met sally this is more when sam did his damnedest not to meet annie sundered by a continent each spends the film dithering with his or her respective dates or mates hanks with a hyenalaughed former flame he has reignited ryan with her stuffy fiance walter bill pullman walter its quite a formal name isnt it says her mother planting the early antiwalter timebomb and yes soon ryan is hankering after hanks a fact we recognise from her constant reviewings of an affair to remember on tv used by ephron as a flagofdistress romantic leitmotif and from her sobbings over cary grant and deborah kerr as they stumble starcrossed towards the worlds tallest building of course the empire state is no longer the worlds tallest building but who wants a romantic tryst atop the world trade centre besides sleepless in seattle is all about the absurdity of romantic destiny as a concept what we think is fate someone cracks is just two neuroses knowing theyre a perfect match this film would be sentimental if it were not funny at sentimentalitys expense witness the scene where a girl sobbingly relates the climax to a favourite weepie to two men friends who then parody her with a sobbing account of the climax to the dirty dozen it ends of course with stars and sighs and destiny fulfilled but this like the wedding banquet is a feelgood film that puts in enough early work in the reality department to earn its right to feel good and to make us do so the fugitive has been a monster hit in america there any film with harrison ford jumping from crashed prison vans sidestepping oncoming express trains leaping from the tops of dams and exposing corruption in high places carries the label criticproof actually american critics lauded the film which shows that even an intelligent person can end up soft in the brain if hit over the head often enough dr richard kimble ford is accused of having killed his wife he is packed off to death row but escapes from his prison escort then he doubles back to chicago in disguise to start proving his innocence then oh but you have all seen the fugitive series on tv and if you have not you may get some fresh enjoyment out of this highoctane twaddle speaking personally i felt that the engine kept missing too many coincidences too many oh there he is sightings in hospital corridors which fail unaccountably to end in capture nor was i happy with the idea of a onehanded hit man the real killer played by ghoulish andreas katsulas surely murdering a doctors fully conscious struggling wife is difficult enough with two hands and then there is the danger realised here that the framed doctor will know how to look up the said unilimb in the medical records never mind insanity has its own momentum hollywood its own ignoretherules driving licence andrew under siege davis directs at 90 mph as if trying to reach journeys end without a single comfort stop and tommy lee jones in swashbuckling form as the pursuing us marshal screeches round even more corners on two wheels than mr ford boiling point and in the soup have nought in common but their quasiculinary titles and their links with the mafia the first is a thriller that scarcely reaches feedingbottle temperature mafiaembroiled crook dennis hopper wearing glowing orange hair is pursued through the night by black detective wesley snipes failing to glow at all either histrionically or optically lesson for the week putting a black actor in a film noir is as problematic as putting a white actor in a snow movie you had better make sure your lighting cameraman knows his business in the soup we have reviewed before when it opened to three men and a dog at the national film theatre now this funny film about filmmaking is in the west end with its mishapprone hero steve buscemi finding that the shortest route to movie finance is through an even more mishapprone mafia boss seymour cassel and you may all if you please attend
