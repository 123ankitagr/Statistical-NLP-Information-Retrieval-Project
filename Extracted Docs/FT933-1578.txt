the wedding banquet 15 ang lee sleepless in seattle pg nora ephron the fugitive 12 andrew davis boiling point 15 james b harris in the soup 15 alexandre rockwell by nigel andrews cinema's pr industry has its own form of shotgun wedding when it likes the sound of two words together it forces them to unite for life thirty years ago word-marriages like spinechilling bloodcurdling and ribtickling were the stuff of promo language large with hyperbole armed with the warheads of exclamation marks they hurtled out from the screen towards us in movie trailers today's favourite compound more suited to an age of psychobabble and post-yuppyism is feelgood but what are feelgood movies short answer the wedding banquet and sleepless in seattle are they present human problems and then they fix them they ask you to believe that people are fundamentally loving and warm they have happy endings and they are the disposable-tissue industry's best friend the worst feelgood movies can also make you feel cheated your tears or cheers wrung by a form of emotional arm-wrestling using music plot contrivance limpid-eyed stars and if possible a dog but there are no dogs in the wedding banquet and sleepless in seattle two of the best romantic comedies in recent memory and there is enough sour wit and credible cross-accident to make any last-reel handkerchief-reaching feel well earned the first movie won the golden bear at berlin this year the hero winston chao is taiwanese-american just like the film and lives prosperously in new york he devotes half his emotional energies to his native gay lover mitchell lichtenstein the other half to parrying parental postcards from taipei urging marriage when pa and ma turn up in person for a two-week visit the lovers stash away the gay calendars masquerade as flat-sharers and recruit a taiwanese girl painter who wants a green card to stay in america for a let's-make the-folks-happy wedding writer-director ang lee scarcely sounds a false note things go right in the story only after they have spent a proper amount of time going wrong for much of the movie the hero's parent-deterring subterfuges backfire as when he fills in a computer marriage form they have sent and lists a near-impossible blend of specifications in his bride two doctorate degrees five languages an opera singing career only for a suitable candidate to turn up on the next plane she bursts into madam butterfly right there at the east river cafe soon she has been put on the next plane out around the wedding itself the comic set-pieces are scattered like confetti a registry ceremony with the foreign-born bride ever more bewildered in her responses for better for richer till sickness and death a gay best man lichtenstein making sure his friend's lips are wiped after each kiss and games of musical woks back home in the kitchen here the gay lover conscious of appearances leaps away from the stove whenever the parents pass through pushing artist-bride plus wooden spoon into the steam the film's final accelerando of disaster including pregnancy and parental truth-learning keeps the story piquant and perilous even as the almost happy ending looms sleepless in seattle also spends furlongs of footage working to deserve its feelgood factor here is a romance between a boy and girl who never meet well they might meet in the final minutes but why should i spoil your fun by specifying whether they do whether seattle widower tom hanks and baltimore pen-friend meg ryan actually fulfil their mooted valentine's day tryst atop the empire state building only hanks's small son ross malinger has really tried to make it work he first set the two hearts fluttering by pushing lonely dad into a radio agony phone-in where he bared his soul to a listening world including 3000 miles away in a car the captivated ryan director and co-writer nora ephron manhandles david twohy's original story into a semblance of her own sweet-and-sour romance when harry met sally this is more when sam did his damnedest not to meet annie sundered by a continent each spends the film dithering with his or her respective dates or mates hanks with a hyena-laughed former flame he has re-ignited ryan with her stuffy fiance walter bill pullman walter it's quite a formal name isn't it says her mother planting the early anti-walter time-bomb and yes soon ryan is hankering after hanks a fact we recognise from her constant re-viewings of an affair to remember on tv used by ephron as a flag-of-distress romantic leitmotif and from her sobbings over cary grant and deborah kerr as they stumble star-crossed towards the world's tallest building of course the empire state is no longer the world's tallest building but who wants a romantic tryst atop the world trade centre besides sleepless in seattle is all about the absurdity of romantic destiny as a concept what we think is fate someone cracks is just two neuroses knowing they're a perfect match this film would be sentimental if it were not funny at sentimentality's expense witness the scene where a girl sobbingly relates the climax to a favourite weepie to two men friends who then parody her with a sobbing account of the climax to the dirty dozen it ends of course with stars and sighs and destiny fulfilled but this like the wedding banquet is a feelgood film that puts in enough early work in the reality department to earn its right to feel good and to make us do so the fugitive has been a monster hit in america there any film with harrison ford jumping from crashed prison vans sidestepping oncoming express trains leaping from the tops of dams and exposing corruption in high places carries the label critic-proof' actually american critics lauded the film which shows that even an intelligent person can end up soft in the brain if hit over the head often enough dr richard kimble ford is accused of having killed his wife he is packed off to death row but escapes from his prison escort then he doubles back to chicago in disguise to start proving his innocence then oh but you have all seen the fugitive series on tv and if you have not you may get some fresh enjoyment out of this high-octane twaddle speaking personally i felt that the engine kept missing too many coincidences too many oh there he is sightings in hospital corridors which fail unaccountably to end in capture nor was i happy with the idea of a one-handed hit man the real killer played by ghoulish andreas katsulas surely murdering a doctor's fully conscious struggling wife is difficult enough with two hands and then there is the danger realised here that the framed doctor will know how to look up the said uni-limb in the medical records never mind insanity has its own momentum hollywood its own ignore-the-rules driving licence andrew under siege davis directs at 90 mph as if trying to reach journey's end without a single comfort stop and tommy lee jones in swashbuckling form as the pursuing us marshal screeches round even more corners on two wheels than mr ford boiling point and in the soup have nought in common but their quasi-culinary titles and their links with the mafia the first is a thriller that scarcely reaches feeding-bottle temperature mafia-embroiled crook dennis hopper wearing glowing orange hair is pursued through the night by black detective wesley snipes failing to glow at all either histrionically or optically lesson for the week putting a black actor in a film noir is as problematic as putting a white actor in a snow movie you had better make sure your lighting cameraman knows his business in the soup we have reviewed before when it opened to three men and a dog at the national film theatre now this funny film about film-making is in the west end with its mishap-prone hero steve buscemi finding that the shortest route to movie finance is through an even more mishap-prone mafia boss seymour cassel and you may all if you please attend
