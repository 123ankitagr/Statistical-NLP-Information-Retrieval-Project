Sir , At last . Your report of the Eurolink Age study of age discrimination ( 'Ageism in the workplace ' , October 7 ) rightly asks why a large part of the country 's workforce is constantly swimming against the tide . As well as changes to pensions and retirement arrangements , we can learn a lot from how other countries organise their affairs . This week people who care about age discrimination will examine what is on offer for older workers throughout Europe at a big European Year conference ( October 11-13 ) . The aim is to encourage all employers fully to recognise the value of their older staff , and to train them to the limits of their potential . But everyone throughout industry and commerce needs to look at their own attitudes towards older people in their workplace , and at the effects of their employment practices across the board . In this European Year the tide must be turned on this particularly insidious and destructive form of discrimination .
