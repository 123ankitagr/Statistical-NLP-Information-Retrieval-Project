ROSYTH Royal Dockyard , the privately-managed Fife naval facility threatened with losing its nuclear submarine refitting business , said yesterday that a proposal for it to upgrade oil tankers instead was unlikely to work . The proposal , made last month by the rival Devonport yard in Plymouth , was aimed at finding an alternative use for the incomplete submarine dock project at Rosyth , on which Pounds 120m of government money has been spent . Rosyth 's counter-study found the proposal 'deeply flawed ' .
