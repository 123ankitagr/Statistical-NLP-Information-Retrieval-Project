City Council members on Tuesday voted to rotate the mayor 's job among themselves every 9 1/2 months . By a 3-2 vote , the council abolished the current system , which provided for two-year terms for mayors elected by members of the council . Mayors were eligible to seek reelection . Under the new system there will be no election for mayor . Instead , the council has adopted a rotation system in which each member will serve as mayor over a four-year period . The rotation system goes into effect after council elections in April . Mayor Pro Tem James Castaneda opposed the rotating mayor system . `` We 're making a change here without doing all the homework , '' Castaneda told the council . He suggested that the system should be changed to allow the voters , instead of the council , to elect a mayor . Mayor John Tapp , whose term expires in April , agreed . `` I 'd like to go to a system where the people do have a voice , '' he said . But Councilwoman Mary Cammarano said the new system , patterned after methods used by Alhambra and Monterey Park , is more fair than a two-year term for the mayor . `` Everybody gets a chance to be mayor this way , '' she said . In the new rotation , Castaneda will become mayor on April 17 . At one point during the debate , Councilman Sabino Cici proposed that the change take place immediately , which would have allowed Castaneda a head start on his term . But Cici 's motion died because of lack of support .
