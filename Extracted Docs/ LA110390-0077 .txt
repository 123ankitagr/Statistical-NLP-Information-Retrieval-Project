The German government said Friday that it is confident that other European personalities will join former Chancellor Willy Brandt on his controversial trip to Iraq next week . `` It is highly unlikely that Herr Brandt will travel alone , '' Foreign Ministry spokesman Juergen Chrobog said . The statement appeared to imply that former Italian Prime Minister Emilio Colombo and former Belgian Finance Minister Willy de Clercq might join Brandt on the trip to Baghdad , where Brandt is expected to seek release of European hostages . German Chancellor Helmut Kohl had asked the European Community president , Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti , to suggest to U.N. Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar that Colombo and De Clercq travel to Iraq as special envoys . Perez de Cuellar , in talks with Brandt on Wednesday , wished the former chancellor good luck but declined to name him as a U.N envoy . On Thursday , Britain reacted angrily to the planned trip , saying that such visits must be discouraged and that London was not consulted . But German government spokesman Hans Klein said Friday that the trip is in agreement with a European Community summit decision made last weekend in Rome to discourage isolated visits to Baghdad . `` In its activities , the federal government strictly adheres to the Oct. 28 declaration of the European Council in Rome , '' Klein said .
