holographic crystals have the potential to store large amounts of information more efficiently than any existing information storage system scientists at stanford university report in this weeks issue of science a us journal that they have developed a fully automated digital holographic data storage system with a total useful data capacity of 163000 bytes the technique involves converting data to an optical signal which is then recorded in a holographic crystal the information can be retrieved by illuminating the crystal and converting the optical signal back into an electronic signal potentially this technique could be used to store trillions of bytes of information john heanue stanford university us tel 415 723 9127
