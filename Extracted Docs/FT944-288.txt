north korea early today released a us airman whose helicopter went down over the communist state nearly two weeks ago his release appeared to defuse the fresh diplomatic row that flared up between pyongyang and washington only two months after they had finalised an accord on the north's nuclear programme the pilot chief warrant officer bobby hall crossed the border at panmunjom into south korea his release came after the us sent a senior envoy mr thomas hubbard to pyongyang on wednesday for negotiations a washington official said the us had expressed sincere regret for the helicopter's violation of north korean air space it agreed to hold contacts with the north in an appropriate forum to prevent similar incidents in the future the us believes the existing military armistice commission set up after the korean war should be the forum for such contacts but north korea could well press for separate bilateral talks the north koreans have insisted that the two us pilots one of whom was killed when their helicopter came down were on a spying mission and they published a confession from mr hall in his ambiguous confession mr hall admitted that his reconnaissance helicopter made an intrusion deep into north korean airspace adding this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable but any further delay in his release might have increased chances of the new republican-controlled us congress trying to block implementation of the us nuclear accord with north korea under this accord pyongyang agreed to dismantle its nuclear programme in return for us diplomatic ties and international economic aid the pilot's apology may have provided a face-saving means for his release while allowing north korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter the statement if it was dictated by north korean officials as many believe did not offer much support for pyongyang's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate mr hall's statement said his helicopter deviated from its planned flight route within south korea but gave no explanation why it strayed across the demilitarised zone into the north this could imply support for the us claim that the helicopter lost its way due to a navigational error but some south korean government analysts believe mr hall's statement that it was on an observation reconnaissance mission could be interpreted as espionage if north korea decides to press the affair north korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the us sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 korean war and begin withdrawing its 37,000 troops from south korea
