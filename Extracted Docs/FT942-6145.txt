boardedup shops dilapidated buildings and empty streets are evidence of the mounting pressures facing britains town centres recession a greater reliance on cars and competition from business parks and outoftown shopping centres have undermined the prosperity of many traditional centres over the past five years the problem is widespread and urgent according to a recent government report vital and viable town centres whereas in the 1980s most british towns expected their shopping centres to grow many now feel threatened and there are widespread signs of decline many towns and cities are at a turning point it says the need to stop the rot has assumed a new prominence in the governments environmental policies john gummer environment secretary has recently introduced guidelines to help to curb outoftown development reduce the need for lengthy car journeys and improve the vitality of city centres the need for sustainable development is at the centre of his concerns we can not afford urban sprawl and to place development in locations which can only be served by long trips by car he said last week gummers guidelines represent a marked change from the laisser faire policies of the last decade under which the uk became home to some of the largest outoftown shopping centres in europe the most striking aspect of the policy shift is the proposed tightening of the planning rules on future developments of this kind according to a guidance note ppg6 issued last summer planning authorities should not promote large outoftown stores if they would seriously jeopardise town centres this guidance was followed by a draft consultation paper on transport policies published earlier this year which discouraged local authorities from allowing development unless it was easily serviced by public transport gummers proposals have been welcomed by the environmental lobby as well as by many planners property owners and retailers but critics say they have been insufficiently thought through they claim that obstructing outoftown development is not enough to ensure a vibrant town centre neglect as well as the threat from outoftown shopping pose the most serious threats to town centres according to the report strengthening planning policies is not enough it says the point was echoed by the consumers association at a recent select committee hearing town centres will survive only if they provide shoppers with what they want and need it said town centres are being told to fight back the government report says local authorities should work with local businesses and other key interests to upgrade town centres by making the town look wellcared for and by improving shortstay car parking bus services and security but who should pay for such improvements the report acknowledges that local businesses are resistant to foot the bill as businesses often believe they are already paying for local services through the business rate there is a need to review the mechanisms for resourcing the improvement and maintenance of town centres it says as matters stand there is little reason to expect more money to be spent on town centres a recent report by hillier parker into quality in the public realm found that only 20 per cent of local authorities plan to spend more than pounds 1m and 46 per cent planned to spend less than pounds 500000 on town centre improvements over the next three years all recent research shows that there is risk that the share of total retail spending taken by town centres will continue to decline says brian raggett the reports author another concern is that a clampdown on outoftown development will lead to increased town centre congestion this has long been an obstacle to town centre development what drives developers out of town is the unwillingness of local authorities to allow development in town says william mckee of the british property federation a landlords association peter hall who was until recently a planning adviser to gummer says what we have to ensure is that the restoration of city centres is not achieved by congestion which could be less sustainable than allowing development to go out into the green fields he suggests curbing the growth of towns and cities by establishing new settlements new communities form part of the package of sustainable development the pronouncements of the planners and policy formers are viewed with bemusement by many property developers who feel that the governments planning policy lacks consistency they claim that this wastes time and money when they are dealing with projects that take many years to plan and assemble but there is a more fundamental reservation on the part of the development industry to the governments revised policy the british property federation which represents landlords is concerned that the importance of economic development may be lost in the clamour for environmental protection we want to support sustainable development but we think there is a grave danger that the sustainable development argument will be used to turn down anything the environmental lobby does not like says mckee the defenders of a more liberal planning policy argue that the swing to outoftown shopping is underpinned by a strong demand from consumers many traditional high street shops are shifting to outoftown centres retail warehouses are now embracing products such as toys electrical goods and computers and discount warehouses such as costco at thurrock in essex are making increasing inroads into the market the pressures for more outoftown and edgeoftown development lead some commentators to argue that the government should crack down decisively to prevent further erosion of the countryside and the vitality of cities duncan mclaren of friends of the earth the environmental pressure group believes that the time has come for the uk to choose between usstyle development where almost all shopping is on the ringroads surrounding a town or the model of most continental cities which generally have central shopping facilities at the moment we are at a crossroads he says others argue that the uk should opt for a combination of outoftown development and town centre development in an effort to reduce congestion and preserve the character of town centres outoftown sites and thriving town centres are not mutually exclusive says stuart robinson of chartered surveyors hillier parker the question of how well an outoftown development can coexist with a healthy town centre depends on the towns circumstances in big towns the demand may be large enough to accommodate both outoftown superstores and a healthy retail sector within the town centre in small towns the arrival of a superstore may squeeze out smaller retailers in the town centres many planning experts believe that the governments policies may turn out to be less radical than they first appear for all gummers rhetoric the wording of his departments new guidelines is relatively mild the shift in policy is not one of moving from free development to restricted development says ross davies of the oxford institute of retail management it is a swing back to a balanced view vital and viable town centres hmso
