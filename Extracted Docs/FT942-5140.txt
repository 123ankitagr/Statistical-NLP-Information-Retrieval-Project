the spirit of benjamin britten remains the presiding genius at the aldeburgh festival which begins on friday this year's programme pairs britten with stravinsky contemporaries and complimentary composers who shared some musical interests but set out to explore very different personal issues both wrote fine medium-scale works for which the intimate atmosphere of the maltings at snape is best suited a handful of premieres and some interesteing recitals are other highlights of the festival which runs until june 26
