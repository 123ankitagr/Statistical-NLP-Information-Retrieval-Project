the biggest elections news next month will be whether manhattan borough president david n dinkins becomes the first black mayor of new york city and whether lt gov l douglas wilder becomes the first black governor of virginia or any other state the underlying question in both contests can a black candidate be elected in a constituency where blacks are a relatively small minority while the outcomes of the november races are still too close to call californians may be especially interested in the results having already answered the question although blacks made up less than 15 of los angeles tom bradley was elected mayor in 1973 16 years before dinkins was nominated in new york where black people are 25 of the citys population current rep mervyn m dymally dcompton became the first black person elected lieutenant governor of california in 1975 10 years before wilder won the same position in virginia then in 1982 when the black population of california was proportionately much smaller than the black population of virginia is today about 19 bradley ran for governor and lost by a hairbreadth margin californias brand of black politics has led the nation in other ways willie brown dsan francisco was elected speaker of the state assembly nine years before washingtons ron brown was elected chairman of the democratic national committee state assemblywoman maxine waters dlos angeles was elected chair of the democratic caucus four years before rep william h gray iii dpa was elected chairman of the congressional democratic caucus in 1986 waters wrote a law vetoed by gov george deukmejian requiring state fund managers to divest stocks of companies doing business in south africa that was the same year black congressmen finally rammed through apartheid sanctions over president reagans veto if the old axiom as maine goes so goes the nation is true of presidential elections the paraphrase as california goes so goes the nation is true in black politics california has set the agenda for important issues and developments in black politics across the nation geography and demography help explain californias exemplary position because most of states black population did not arrive until after world war ii california had no long history of legal segregation the west didnt experience the freedom rides or anything like the montgomery bus boycott of 1955 californias three largest cities do not have black majorities unlike georgias atlanta michigans detroit or new jerseys newark so in the early 70s california did not experience a period when black people were first assuming political control in the biggest cities of a state in 1962 however voters in watts elected augustus f hawkins dlos angeles one of only five predominantly black congressional districts in the entire nation then represented by a black member of congress major precedents for black politics were set in 1970 when berkeley elected rep ron dellums the first black democrat to win in a district where whites were in the majority it would be 12 more years before another black candidate katie hall of indiana won such a position and only for one term the importance of the california experience has implications for the future in the next decade the tests will not be what black people can accomplish within their own communities but what they can accomplish in coalition with other interest groups other than improving the numbers of registered voters and turnout blacks have already mined the prospects within majorityblack areas excepting new orleans every congressional district with a black majority now has a black member of congress and according to the joint center for political studies the leading black think tank every blackmajority city with a population of more 200000 people has a black mayor future growth of black political power then depends on what blacks can accomplish in coalition with whites women unions business groups political parties and other minorities the key is coalitionbuilding and that is where black people in california have had some truly remarkable successes with four black members of congress california and new york have the largest black delegations in the house yet new york has more black citizens than california perhaps more important all new york black congressmen are from districts where blacks make up no less than 47 of the votingage population only one black congressman from california hawkins comes from a heavily black area democrat julian c dixons district culver city is less than 40 black with the exception of one missouri district represented by democrat alan wheat only in california have black candidates been elected to congress with so few black votes available and survived for more than one term turning the perspective around california is where people who arent black are most likely to support a black candidate a combination of political and psychological factors make the golden state a fertile ground for black politics in california black elected officials can act as honest brokers between other ethnic groups which is a situation where race is not as important as consensus building said california native jeffrey stewart now a history professor at george mason university this is particularly true visavis blacks and mexicans or asianamericans who are not as well organized yet john smith who has worked with hawkins for more than 25 years agrees that organization has been critical in building black clout the fact that black people are such a small group in california helps make them more cohesive and focused with clear objectives none of this came easily i was living in pasadena when tom bradley first ran in 1969 nearly every black person i knew in my neighborhood was stuffing envelopes or putting stamps on mailers however bradleys current problems are resolved one reason for his past success is that californias population includes the most educated successful black people in america according to the joint center for political studies the metropolitan areas of san diego los angeles and san francisco have the highest levels of black educational achievement these are also three of the four areas where blacks own the most expensive homes in addition to socioeconomic stature black political success is a reflection of an unconventional electorate that could consecutively support such dissimilar governors as ronald reagan and edmund g brown jr according to former rep yvonne burke as a whole california voters are not particularly liberal or particularly conservative what they really are is nontraditional so many of the issues theyre involved with like ecology dont fall along old racial lines dixon points out that california politics are not characterized by machines that decide or limit who runs for office he agrees that california voters are an independent bunch after all dixon said thats how the state wound up with a republican governor and a democratic lieutenant governor im not saying that there are no racial problems in california but because voters are somewhat more openminded and independent they are much more willing to go past race and look at a black politician as a politician who just happens to be black
