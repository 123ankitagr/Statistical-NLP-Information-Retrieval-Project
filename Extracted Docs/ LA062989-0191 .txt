A tearful Imelda Marcos quietly sang a love song today to her husband , ousted Philippine President Ferdinand E. Marcos , as he lay close to death . `` We are praying for a miracle , '' she said . `` If I could just tell him he could go back home ( to the Philippines ) , I know this would save him . '' The Philippine bedside song , `` How Much I love You , '' appeared to get a response from the deposed president , in a semi-comatose state with kidney , heart and lung failure . He opened his eyes and squeezed his wife 's hand , friends claimed . Philippine President Corazon Aquino has refused repeated requests by Marcos to return to his homeland to die .
