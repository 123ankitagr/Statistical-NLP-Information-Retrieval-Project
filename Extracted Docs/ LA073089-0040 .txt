question would you explain how the new scroll compressor-type of central air conditioner works is it really more energy-efficiency and more maintenance-free as the contractors tell me answer the most recent major design innovation for central air conditioners is a high-efficiency scroll compressor in place of a standard piston-type compressor a new scroll compressor air conditioner can cut your electric bills significantly and minimize maintenance costs several air conditioner manufacturers are now using scroll compressors with seasonal energy efficiency ratios seer up to 12 your old unit may have a seer as low as 6 seer relates the amount of cooling output of a central air conditioner to the amount of electricity it uses by its design the scroll compressor is very reliable unlike conventional compressors with many moving parts pistons valves seals etc a scroll compressor has only four moving parts as it gets older the few moving parts of a scroll compressor actually wear in and operate better it is also more tolerant of foreign matter and fluids in the system without the pistons and valves used in a standard compressor a scroll compressor operates more quietly and more vibration-free this is an advantage both for you and your neighbors the operating principle of a scroll compressor is simple two spiral-shaped members fit together one remains stationary while the other orbits relative to it this creates gas pockets which gradually decrease in size to compress the freon since several pockets of freon are compressed simultaneously in the scroll members it produces a smooth and nearly continuous compression cycle in contrast a standard piston compressor produces fewer and larger compression pulses per cycle when you select a new central air conditioner have your contractor do a detailed heat gain analysis for your house many use computers and sophisticated programs an improperly sized central air conditioner not only wastes electricity but doesn't provide the best comfort level you can write to me for utility bills update no 042, showing a list of manufacturers model numbers and seer's of air conditioners using scroll compressors a chart showing the electricity saving by installing a high-efficiency unit and more detailed information on the scroll compressor please include 1 and a self-addressed envelope send your requests to james dulley c o los angles times 6906 royalgreen drive cincinnati ohio 45244 alarms required to have battery power q i have heard that some areas require smoke alarms that are powered by both batteries and regular house electricity since these operate continuously will they be expensive to operate a the amount of current usage is very low and the operating cost is negligible the reason for requiring two power sources batteries and house current is that people often let the batteries run down they plan to replace them but never get around to doing it and then they forget without power the smoke alarm provides no protection to keep people from removing the batteries to avoid annoying false alarms when cooking some new smoke alarms offer a hush control this allows you to press a button to temporarily decrease the sensitivity of the alarm it resets to normal sensitivity automatically letters and questions to dulley a cincinnati-based engineering consultant may be sent to james dulley los angeles times 6906 royalgreen drive cincinnati ohio 45244
