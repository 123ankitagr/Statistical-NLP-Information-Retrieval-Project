THE NATIONAL Health Service and hospital trusts are to spend Pounds 1.6bn on building improvements as a consequence of the lifting of Crown immunity from hospital properties , a survey of health authorities says , Daniel Green writes . Most of the work is to conform with fire regulations . NHS Crown immunity was lifted a year ago . Until then planning regulations did not apply to hospitals . One authority has been quoted Pounds 40m to upgrade its five hospitals . The Audit Commission yesterday described the findings of the survey as 'reasonable ' . One fifth of health authorities and hospital trusts were asked by Building Intelligence Digest , a consultancy , how much they planned to spend to conform to regulations . Nearly two thirds had earmarked Pounds 2m with one in seven planning to spend more than Pounds 10m .
