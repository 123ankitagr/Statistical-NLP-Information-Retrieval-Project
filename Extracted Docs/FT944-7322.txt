The government plans to finance the development of the National Forest by topping up the existing system of subsidies to landowners . The National Forest is aimed at providing 200 sq miles of the Midlands with wooded landscape , combining environmental change with economic regeneration . The area 's forestry cover would rise from 6 per cent to 30 per cent . It would , said the National Forest strategy , published yesterday , be 'woven into the physical and economic fabric of the area ' , which straddles Derbyshire , Leicestershire and Staffordshire . Mr John Gummer , the environment secretary , said in Burton-on-Trent yesterday he had no idea what specific spending on the forest would be . But the government would supplement the woodland grant scheme , the staple subsidy for forestry initiatives , with incentives for the National Forest area at a cost of Pounds 1m in the first year . The woodland grant scheme , on which Pounds 15m will be spent in England during this financial year , provides subsidies for the establishment and management of plantations . Under the new incentive system , landowners in the National Forest area can tender for additional funds to pay for projects leading to the provision of open space and other public benefits . Development of the forest will be under the control of a new government quango - whose first chairman will be Mr Rodney Swarbrick . The quango will start operations in April . Separately , the Department of the Environment said the Rural Development Commission would pay Pounds 1m over three years to help reclamation of a former colliery at Moira , near Ashby de la Zouch , Leicestershire , in the National Forest area .
