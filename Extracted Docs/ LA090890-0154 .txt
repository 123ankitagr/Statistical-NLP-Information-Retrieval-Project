when i lived in san francisco a few years ago i had a neighbor who kept a pair of plastic pink lawn flamingos in a large indoor planter box they werent just pink but an audible jangling sizzling screaming sort of ferocious nuclear meltdown pink that radiated around the room like a carbon arc beam and my neighbor loved them with a deep abiding love they invariably inspired comment guests would arrive and immediately reel back out into the hallway not quite ready to believe what they were seeing the things might as well have been pink elephants the last time any of them had seen plastic lawn flamingos never mind ones that shot shattering bolts of pink throughout the room they had tripped over them in the neighbors yard on their way to watch howdy doody nevertheless there was something about them a certain goofy genuineness a blaring presence that announced that you were in the home of someone who would rather be buried neck deep in an anthill than say own a car phone they were infectious guests who had not been to my neighbors house before would invariably end up standing on one leg and doing flamingo imitations before the evening was through and just as invariably they would want to know where they too could buy a pair four hours before the idea of owning a pair of plastic pink lawn flamingos had about as good a chance of materializing in their minds as the thought of dan quayle in a bunny suit but once the visitors saw them and lived with them for a bit they would embark on a holy quest for the things that made the crusades look like a trip to the 7eleven so right away let me save you a bit of time and anguish perhaps the easiest way to acquire a pair of plastic pink lawn flamingos is to order them from a truly inspired outfit in seattle called archie mcphee and co it is a mailorder house and it sells among other bits of esoterica groucho glasses rubber chickens plastic tiki lamps batman drinking mugs and beaspy kits they also sell plastic pink lawn flamingos each about 3 feet tall for $ 950 a pair plus $ 3 shipping archie mcphee is at po box 30852 seattle wash 981030852 or you can place an order by calling 206 5472467 theyve had their ups and downs over the years but for the most part theyve been a real steady item said brian eklund the office manager of mcphees wholesale division the main call for them is for housewarming presents and a lot of people buy them around christmastime theyll exchange them at office christmas parties theyre a real classic kind of tacky joke item a joke to eklund perhaps but theyve been paying don featherstones freight since he designed the classic 3d flamingo back in the 50s featherstone is the vice president of union products of leominster mass the manufacturer that introduced the lawn flamingo to the world in 1952 that first flamingo model said featherstone was plastic and flat and somewhat aesthetically unappealing when contrasted with the present incarnation the second model was threedimensional but it was made of construction foam and fell apart rather quickly said featherstone dogs loved to chew it up finally in 1957 featherstone hit the mother lode he sculpted a threedimensional pink plastic flamingo that was artistic durable and for the most part dogproof it is the model that union products continues to sell today complete with featherstones molded signature on the underside of each bird its designer poor taste he said although easily the most recognized of unions products it specializes in plastic lawn art the flamingo is not the companys biggest seller said featherstone unions original item a plastic lawn duck is still no 1 followed by the plastic henandchicks combo the flamingo is third the company sells about 250000 pairs of them each year said featherstone union also makes plastic squirrels rabbits cows a total of 50 different plastic animals to strew around the lawn but said featherstone the flamingo has a devoted cult following there are several clubs and organizations around the country he said that dont really worship the flamingos but they get together and have parties in virginia theres a group that has a parade and everybody dresses in pink theyve been doing it for 12 or 13 years and in connecticut he said theres a group called the society for the preservation of the pink plastic lawn flamingo admittedly this sort of thing is not for everybody people who own designer pets for example or those who only allow their kids to watch pbs probably wont appreciate the guaranteed double takes that will occur when passersby notice the hotpink waterfowl jutting from the bedding plants if however you long to own a couple of nonbiodegradable pieces of true americana for cheap signed by the designer himself and guaranteed to jazz up your landscape like a zoot suit jazzes up an inaugural ball then part with a sawbuck or so and get the birds then throw a party and take note of which guests try to stand on one leg theyre the ones you invite back next time
