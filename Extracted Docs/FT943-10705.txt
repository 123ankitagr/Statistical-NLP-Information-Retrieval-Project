Spain 's Banco Santander , which in May acquired the loss-making Banesto group for more than Dollars 2bn , received an important credit boost yesterday when Standard and Poor 's , the US rating agency , left the bank 's short-term debt and commercial paper qualification unchanged at an A1 plus rating . Standard and Poor 's , which had placed Santander on credit watch after the Banesto takeover , nevertheless marginally lowered the bank 's long-term debt rating to AA minus . In a more surprising move , Banesto , which will consolidate with Santander after next month , has been upgraded to A1 from A3 for commercial paper following its acquisition . The US rating agency said the lowered rating 'related solely to the acquisition of Banesto ' . IBCA , the London-based agency , meanwhile , lowered Banco Central Hispano for the second time in the past year , reducing its long-term rating from A plus to A and its individual rating from B/C to C .
