when steve sharon wrote the screenplay to the clint eastwood thriller the dead pool he didn't rely much on outside help he typed away on a computer in his huntington beach home he didn't even use a typing service or a research assistant i can do the typing just as quickly myself he said and i prefer to do my own research so i have a fuller understanding of whatever it is i'm writing about but he does have his own special and rather costly computer equipment and he has attended several seminars on screen writing techniques always check the background of the person teaching the seminar he suggests if they've sold some screenplays it probably gives them more credibility but that's not necessarily a prerequisite sharon 33, also said novice screenwriters probably don't need to invest in a large library of screen writing books there's nothing new being invented about writing screenplays said sharon if you've read one good book you probably don't need any others the business of screen writing is very unusual sharon said a screenwriter is someone who creates his own problems and then tries to solve them as creatively as possible bruce horovitz
