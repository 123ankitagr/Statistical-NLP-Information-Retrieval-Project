When Steve Sharon wrote the screenplay to the Clint Eastwood thriller `` The Dead Pool , '' he did n't rely much on outside help . He typed away on a computer in his Huntington Beach home . He did n't even use a typing service or a research assistant . `` I can do the typing just as quickly myself , '' he said . `` And I prefer to do my own research so I have a fuller understanding of whatever it is I 'm writing about . '' But he does have his own special -- and rather costly -- computer equipment . And he has attended several seminars on screen writing techniques . `` Always check the background of the person teaching the seminar , '' he suggests . `` If they 've sold some screenplays , it probably gives them more credibility , but that 's not necessarily a prerequisite . '' Sharon , 33 , also said novice screenwriters probably do n't need to invest in a large library of screen writing books . `` There 's nothing new being invented about writing screenplays , '' said Sharon . `` If you 've read one good book , you probably do n't need any others . '' The business of screen writing is very unusual , Sharon said . `` A screenwriter is someone who creates his own problems and then tries to solve them as creatively as possible . '' BRUCE HOROVITZ
