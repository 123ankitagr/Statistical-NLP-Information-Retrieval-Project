PERSONAL computer production at the Apricot Computer plant in Glenrothes , Scotland , is likely to treble next year after completion of a 3,000 sq metre extension . It will mean a further 25 jobs , a 10 per cent increase in Apricot's workforce . The company , formerly the hardware arm of ACT Group of Birmingham , is now wholly owned by Mitsubishi Electric of Japan . Last year , as part of the expansion plan , Mitsubishi increased Apricot 's paid-up capital from Pounds 3.2m to Pounds 12.6m . The extension is expected to cost about Y1.5bn ( Pounds 6.55m ) . Mr Peter Horne , Apricot managing director , said using new technology would cut costs and improve efficiency to the point where manufacturing costs in Scotland were lower than at Mitsubishi 's plants in either Singapore or Japan . He said the extension would house a clean room for surface mount technology , an advanced semiconductor technique in which microchips are bonded directly to both sides of printed circuit boards . At present Apricot buys some of its printed circuit boards from subcontractors . Apricot is Mitsubishi 's world centre for workstations and open systems - compatible with industry standard - technology . The plan is to increase production from 38,000 to 100,000 units a year and increase exports from 10 per cent of capacity to 25 per cent . About half the exported systems are expected to be shipped to Japan .
