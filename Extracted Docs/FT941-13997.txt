Sir , You report ( 'Transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs ' , January 15/16 ) that the Department of Transport is to make available grants to passenger transport executives which will 'continue indefinitely . . . to offset the extra costs caused by railway privatisation ' . Can someone remind me why railway privatisation was thought to be such a good idea ? I can only remember two reasons : first , that it was impossible to make any more public money available for railway subsidies ; second , that privatisation would reduce costs through efficiency gains . If neither argument now applies , a great deal of public money is being spent on reorganisation to no public benefit . William Wallace , 49 St James 's Drive , Wandsworth Common , London SW17 7RN
