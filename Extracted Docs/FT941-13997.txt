sir you report transport executives win aid for rail sell-off costs january 15 16 that the department of transport is to make available grants to passenger transport executives which will continue indefinitely to offset the extra costs caused by railway privatisation can someone remind me why railway privatisation was thought to be such a good idea i can only remember two reasons first that it was impossible to make any more public money available for railway subsidies second that privatisation would reduce costs through efficiency gains if neither argument now applies a great deal of public money is being spent on reorganisation to no public benefit william wallace 49 st james's drive wandsworth common london sw17 7 rn
