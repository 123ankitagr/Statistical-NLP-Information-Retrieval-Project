Sir , The article by Colin Amery , 'Smiting the Philistines ' ( Arts , January 31 ) , warning that once again the City churches are under threat , is one that all lovers of this unique heritage should heed . When in 1969 I undertook articles with a City firm of chartered accountants , the only advice I received from my father , who had trained likewise in his time , was : 'Take time off to see the City churches . ' I happily followed his advice , visiting all 39 of them , John Betjeman 's guide in hand , and singing in both of the two then remaining City church choirs . It was the most enriching experience of my City years . Tim Coghlan , managing director , Braunston Marina , The Wharf , Braunston , nr Daventry , Northamptonshire NN11 7JH
