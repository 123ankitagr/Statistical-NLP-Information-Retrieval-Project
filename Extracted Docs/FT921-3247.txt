britain has suffered survived and vowed never to repeat its early-1980s attempts at pursuing precise domestic monetary targets no mainstream political party describes itself as monetarist all parties are committed to continued membership of the european exchange rate mechanism and all appear resigned to the current combination of high interest rates and rising unemployment yet the current framework of uk economic policy-making remains similar to the one that prolonged the 1980-81 recession uk interest rates are again very high even though the economy has been in recession for over a year and inflation has fallen to european levels what distinguishes the new-style monetarism is its international flavour uk monetary policy is once more determined by an elusive broad money target but the target is now set in frankfurt german broad money growth determines uk interest rates and not vice versa because of the bundesbank's anti-inflation credibility the d-mark has never been devalued within the erm and no member country has ever managed to reduce its interest rates below those of germany the pan-european interest rate floor set by the bundesbank has risen over the past two years as inflationary pressures have built up in germany following unification the fiscal deficit tax increases and the generous terms of monetary unification have all fuelled bank lending and wage and price inflation in december the bundesbank raised german interest rates and revised its target range for annual broad money growth to 3.5 5.5 per cent yet m3 rose by an annualised 9 per cent in january up from 5.8 per cent in december interest rates across europe stay uncomfortably high as a result moreover europe's monetary policy will remain tight for some time despite sluggish economic growth outside germany mr helmut schlesinger bundesbank president last week reaffirmed its commitment to the current monetary target zone and demanded an immediate clampdown on german credit expansion but m3 is not expected to dip back into its new target zone this year as the right-hand side of the chart shows inflation in germany and slow growth elsewhere make german money supply an inappropriate target for european monetary policy does the broad money target make sense for germany monetary targets are only a good guide for policy if the relationship between money and inflation is stable and predictable the relationship has been more stable in germany than in other industrialised countries over the past decade but the recent uk experience counsels caution domestic monetarism in britain collapsed because the government tried to target broad money growth just when an apparently stable relationship between money and inflation was breaking down the abolition of exchange controls and supplementary special deposits in 1979-80 raised the proportion of national income that the public wanted to hold in broad money assets the growth rate of pounds m3 duly shot out of its new target range as the chart shows even though inflation had already begun to fall could german broad money growth also be over-shooting because the relationship between the money stock and nominal income is shifting one reason why this might be so is that the d-mark is being used as a parallel currency elsewhere in eastern europe that would increase the demand for broad money without fuelling german inflation but non-bank deposits have risen at least as fast as currency in circulation another reason why the demand for broad money might have risen is the proposed change to the taxation of interest income later this year this may have prompted investors to sell non-money assets and hold their savings in cash and other broad money deposits meanwhile east germans are still in the process of switching their broad money holdings into other non-money assets all of which makes german money demand unpredictable and the bundesbank's current task particularly difficult a slavish devotion to fixed monetary targets would be risky as the uk experience has demonstrated the rest of europe has little choice other than to trust the bundesbank's judgement
