EUROPE is entering a 'test phase ' for monetary union , when individual central banks have it within their power to create a solid basis for it , the president of the Bundesbank said yesterday . Countries now had to prove the credibility of their national monetary policy , rather than engage in disputes over the framework of European monetary union ( Emu ) as set down in the Maastricht treaty , Mr Hans Tietmeyer told the VWD news agency . This would be the only way that monetary union had a chance of being successfully implemented in practice , Mr Tietmeyer cautioned . Countries would have to show a firm commitment to monetary stability in the years ahead and implement the institutional changes necessary to give national central banks the necessary independence . It was also important for public opinion to develop a 'stability culture ' , he said . Mr Tietmeyer was giving his reaction to the German Constitutional Court 's ruling on Tuesday that Germany 's ratification of the Maastricht treaty was valid . The second stage of monetary union is due to to start on January 1 next year when the European Monetary Institute ( EMI ) will start operations . Mr Tietmeyer said its role would be to strengthen co-operation between EC central banks and to co-ordinate the monetary policy of member nations with a view to price stability . But responsibility for monetary policy will remain with national central banks during the second stage of monetary union , and all important decisions on the EMS will continue to be taken unanimously , he said . Mr Tietmeyer reiterated his call for the EMI to be located in Frankfurt .
