A 7-year-old cystic fibrosis patient who underwent a heart-lung transplant in April died early today at Stanford University Hospital of complications of surgery , hospital officials said . David Laird Jr. , who suffered from a severe form of the disease since birth , died of postoperative infection and pneumonia , a hospital spokesman said . The boy , son of Deanna and David Laird Sr. of Ceres , was the youngest patient with the disease to have a heart-lung transplant at the hospital . `` David was an exceptional kid . He had a lot of spirit , '' said hospital spokesman Diarmuid McGuire . `` He was a fighter . That was one of the reasons he was chosen , I think , for this very difficult procedure . His spirit was so strong . ''
