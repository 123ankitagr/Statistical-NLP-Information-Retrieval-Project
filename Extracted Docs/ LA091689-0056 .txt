With a stern warning to drinkers to stay off the road , Gov . George Deukmejian signed legislation Friday to toughen California 's drunk driving standard -- dropping the legal blood alcohol level from .10 % to .08 % beginning Jan. 1 . Under the bill by Sen. Bill Leonard ( R-Big Bear ) , a few quickly downed drinks can mean arrest and possibly jail time for those who get behind the wheel despite the new law . The measure , Deukmejian said , represents `` a strong message to ( drinking drivers ) that we are all trying to prevent further injuries and deaths . And they can prevent getting arrested , getting handcuffed , getting fingerprinted , getting taken to jail and spending time there and paying very , very strong fines '' only if they do n't drink and drive . Deukmejian said he will also consider signing another drunk driving bill -- one that would impose an even tighter standard for truck drivers by making a blood alcohol level of .04 the legal limit for those who drive for a living . The commercial driving bill , by Sen. John Seymour ( R-Anaheim ) , won final approval in the Senate on Thursday . The tough measure , which would go into effect Jan. 1 , 1992 , would also apply to those who operate ships and boats for commercial purposes in California waters . Under the proposal , commercial drivers who are caught with any amount of alcohol at all in their system would be kept off the job for 24 hours . The Seymour bill would bring California into line with new federal standards for commercial drivers . Failure to have those standards in place by 1994 would cost the state an estimated $ 43 million in lost federal highway funds the first year and $ 86 million each year thereafter . Deukmejian noted that increased penalties and tougher enforcement of drunk driving statutes have already had an effect . Notes Reduction '' We are seeing a reduction in the number of traffic fatalities caused by drunk drivers , '' the governor said . `` On the other hand we still have a far greater number of such fatalities than we should have in California . Despite all of the efforts there are some 2,239 Californians and more than 23,000 Americans who died last year in accidents involving drunk drivers . '' Deukmejian said he has not decided whether he agrees with efforts in Congress to tighten drunk driving standards even more -- to a blood alcohol level of .05 % . `` Studies indicate that when somebody 's blood alcohol content level is .05 % or higher for most individuals their driving is impaired , '' Deukmejian said . `` I think there 's no question when it 's .08 % that it is definitely impaired . '' About 350,000 Californians a year are cited for drunk driving , said California Highway Patrol Commissioner Maury Hannigan . Drunk drivers are involved in half of all fatal accidents , according to highway patrol statistics . DRUNK DRIVING LAW This chart shows the percentage of alcohol in the blood , for various weight levels , after one hour from the time the first drink was consumed . One drink is defined as a 12 oz . beer , a 4 oz . class of wine or a 1 1/4 oz . shot of 80 proof liquor . Under the new law that takes effect Jan. 1 , a driver with .08 % or higher is presumed to be drunk ; however , those with lower levels could also be cited for drunk driving .
