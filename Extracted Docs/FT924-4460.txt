her majestys offer to pay income tax has had some unexpected knockon effects in the outer reaches of her realm australias governorgeneral bill hayden and his six state governors for instance are finding to their horror they may have to follow her example hayden who takes home adollars 95000 a year has the use of mansions in canberra and sydney a fleet of limos and gets to fly in the governments vip aircraft these are perks which would normally be taxed under australias loathsome fringe benefits tax but compared with the cost of running the queen haydens annual bill of adollars 8m makes him a bargain oddly it is the conservatives who want him to pay up labor mps have been pointing out that there would be little point in taxing hayden because he would have to be paid more to compensate but there might be some interesting arguments about liability for fringe benefits tax the tax is normally paid by employers but hayden is technically the governments employer which might make him personally liable for taxation on all those houses aircraft and cars alternatively he might argue that the queen should pay because she employs him to represent her either way it looks like further ammunition for australias republicans
