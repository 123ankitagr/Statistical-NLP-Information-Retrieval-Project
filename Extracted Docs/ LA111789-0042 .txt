since well putting large telescope space able recognize stars viewing to achieve scientists space telescope science institute baltimore produced 1989 largest star map ever made star maps long history the first important one prepared ancient greek astronomer hipparchus 130 bc he spotted new star sky something call nova nowadays wanted make sure phenomena would quickly recognized to listed 850 brightest stars gave positions dividing sky lines latitude longitude about ad 150 another astronomer ptolemy incorporated hipparchus data book subject added 170 stars ptolemys map used 14 centuries in 1580s however danish astronomer tycho brahe prepared first modern star map his map included 788 precisely located stars a century later 1661 sharpeyed german astronomer johannes hevelius prepared map containing 1564 stars one even better brahes after hevelius time stars mapped use telescope with telescope also possible see locate stars dim unaided eye discern the first telescopic star map importance prepared english astronomer john flamsteed the map published 1725 six years flamsteeds death listed 3000 stars between 1859 1862 however making use far better telescopes german astronomer friedrich argelander prepared giant map stars cataloguing fewer 457848 four large volumes star carefully listed latitude longitude once became possible photograph night sky large telescopes longer necessary work position star observing by early 1900s possible map millions stars the 1989 map prepared space telescope science institute catalogues position brightness 18829291 objects of 15 million stars galaxy the remaining 3 million 4 million galaxies humans good vision see 6000 stars unaided optics these go 6th magnitude brightness the higher magnitude dimmer star the 1989 map contains stars objects 15th magnitude but modern telescopes make objects 21st magnitude new star map include every visible object means one would think flaws could found enormous accurate star map fact stars move they plunging along huge orbits carry center galaxy fairly circular orbits elongated elliptical orbits the motions slow represent shifts position tiny certainly throw space telescope in five years astronomers estimate fully 10 stars shifted position sufficiently space telescope able recognize what astronomers therefore calculating apparent motions incorporate information star map
