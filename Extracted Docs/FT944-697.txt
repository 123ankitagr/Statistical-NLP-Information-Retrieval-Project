once more christmas has been heralded by the sound of uk retailers complaining of disappointing sales the main cause of disappointment this year is cyclical consumers are not spending as much as they normally do at this stage of economic recovery but the cry is a familiar one it seems that christmas is often a disappointment for the retail trade this is strange because a study of uk consumption data shows the christmas season is normally anything but a retail disappointment in 1993, for example seasonal factors contributed an extra pounds 5 bn to fourth-quarter consumption compared to the third-quarter level given that consumption as a whole rose by just pounds 8 bn in 1993, it becomes obvious why retailers have high expectations for christmas examining these seasonal fluctuations in consumption gives a fascinating insight into the christmas habits of the uk we may all think we over-indulge enormously at the end of year but food consumption rises by only about 2.75 per cent in the fourth quarter of the year we certainly drink and smoke a lot more as a nation at christmas the seasonal effect generates an extra 19.8 per cent of alcohol and tobacco expenditure the combination of cold weather and new winter fashions leads to a substantial increase in expenditure on clothing and footwear with fourth-quarter consumption 23 per cent higher the data also reveal that the additional spending at christmas has been steadily rising over the years and is now at its highest since records began the seasonal boost to consumption of non-durables food drink clothing energy and the like has risen from pounds 1.6 bn in 1960 to pounds 4.8 bn in 1990 between 1960 and 1993 this increased christmas effect boosted consumption by more than pounds 57 per head of the population in 1990 prices the table shows which goods and services are most affected by this increased christmas effect it shows the percentage growth in fourth-quarter consumption which is entirely due to seasonal factors and how this have changed over the years most notable is the surge in christmas spending on drink tobacco and other goods such as sports equipment toys books toiletries and jewellery if the christmas seasonal effect has increased over the years what has caused this change economic commentators invariably explain changes in consumption by reference either to changes in household income or interest rates however neither of these can explain why christmas consumption is becoming more important the variation in household income between seasons is not large and has been getting smaller there is a seasonal pattern in interest rates bank base rates tend to be highest in the last two quarters of the year however there is no evidence that this seasonal pattern has altered over the years so it cannot explain the growth in consumption at christmas similarly the weather offers little explanation of what is going on while the weather clearly influences how much we spend it does not explain the growth in christmas spending it is to social customs that we must look if we are to explain these seasonal consumption changes we tend to think of christmas traditions as fixed and unalterable but in practice the english christmas has changed considerably the social historian john pimlott has investigated the changing features of the english christmas in his fascinating book the englishman's christmas harvester press 1978 far from finding that christmas present is the same as christmas past he concludes that it is part of the tradition that christmas is never as it used to be these changes can be seen by looking at consumption of particular commodities in 1955, for instance more chicken was eaten than turkey at christmas by 1977, more chicken was eaten in a normal week of the year than at christmas at the level of total aggregate consumption the changes in the english christmas have been marked over the longer term in the 17 th century christmas was banned by the puritans in 1647 and revived in 1660 though the legalisation of festivities only partly restored its former glories the publication of a christmas carol by charles dickens in 1843 gave a new boost to the festivities it was in the 1840 s that so much of current christmas tradition was established trees crackers cards and so on for the retailing industry however the most important change in social customs happened in the 1870 s previously presents had been given mainly to children and mostly at new year but it began to be the practice to give them at christmas and to adults as well to the benefit of almost the whole range of the retailing business and industry from that time on the commercial and social importance of christmas continued to increase a process which the data suggest is still occurring will this upward trend in christmas spending continue studying historical trends in consumption seasonality there is considerable evidence that while seasonality changes only very slowly when it does change it changes permanently in other words once new social customs are established they remain in force this suggests that the enhanced importance of christmas to the retailer is likely to remain long after any temporary disappointment over this year's sales has disappeared the author is a fellow of all souls oxford and is affiliated to the centre for economic performance at
