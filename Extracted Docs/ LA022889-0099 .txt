The federal government and the American Cancer Society on Monday announced a stop-smoking drive expected to reach more than one-fifth of the U.S. population and at least 15 million smokers . The National Cancer Institute estimates it will spend $ 116.5 million on the project , which is being billed as `` the world 's largest '' effort to reduce smoking . Scheduled to begin in 1991 and run through 1998 , the drive will be spearheaded by 20 community-based `` tobacco control '' coalitions in major metropolitan areas or throughout entire states . The project will include training health professionals on how to counsel smokers trying to stop , starting special workplace programs and beginning smoking prevention classes in schools .
