february is supposed to be the dry season in tanzania yet kilimanjaro africa's highest mountain remained veiled in ominous mist as we drove towards it out of kenya only when we reached its lowest slopes did the old volcano bare a shoulder we piled out of the bus and gazed up at it the ridge of ice and black lava seemed miles up it was in fact three vertical miles above where we stood what on earth had persuaded 12 tourists that they could walk up that the answer was jean-pierre brain a 50-year-old french insurance executive in normal life he limited himself to packing opera festivals with middle-aged friends now he had coaxed 11 of them including one englishman to share his mid-life crisis and climb kilimanjaro in style dressed more like a golfer than a mountaineer jean-pierre thrust his jaw at the distant summit as if wondering whether a two-iron would do the trick the mountain veiled itself again and stayed hidden from us bar the odd glimpse for the next four days that was on a sunday evening by the following thursday night two of those three vertical miles were below us and our doubts had become the disbelief of people about to mount the scaffold it was midnight we were being given early morning tea in tents perched on a ridge of shattered rock 16,000 ft up the incessant rain that never falls on kilimanjaro in february had been replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes according to the notes on the ordnance survey map in the ghastly light of miners lamps strapped to our foreheads we pulled on every stitch of clothing we had and struggled sick and white-faced out into the night our capable french tour-guide eric christin had already told us what to expect we will climb steeply and slowly for seven hours we will stick together behind the tanzanian guide in one group this will require will-power some of you will vomit if you really cannot go on tell me and i will send you down with a guide the chain-gang set off at a pace so slow that we joked about it at first we climbed disembodiedly inching our personal circles of light up a never-ending snow-slope of 45 degrees the huge volcanic cone of kilimanjaro remained invisible above and below us thin and frigid air whistled in and out of our lungs one breath per step the french chit-chat a feature of the lower slopes died this purgatory continued almost without pause for roughly the time it takes to fly the atlantic such a trial permits only the lowest form of thought an auctioneer from dijon furnished and refurnished his extensive chateau i murmured stalingrad twice as bad like a mantra remembering between throwing up what fun this really was the reward came at dawn the lip of the crater became visible not far above us the huge scale of what we had climbed stretched beneath us down to the violet mass of africa the sun rose behind the science-fiction peak of mawenzi kilimanjaro's little sister by 8 am our troupe had reached the rim of the volcano at 19,000 ft we could gaze into the snow-filled crater and at the surreal glaciers that surround it this was stella point but not the top light-headed with pride altitude and lack of sleep we all elected to climb for another hour trudging around the rim of the crater to the summit uhuru peak at 19,385 ft the highest point in africa of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate tourist route up the mountain that night just two stumbled with us to this true summit our heartiness verged on the lunatic two of the party collapsed on the return march around the crater but then to our great relief it became clear why kilimanjaro had to be climbed at night the equatorial sun grilling down on us with pure ultra-violet had melted the top of the mountain into a great barely climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand the three guides seized the weakest members of our party and ran them down this great soft scree like marionettes the rest of us staggered down in pursuit losing 4,000 hard-won feet in just over an hour we reached the highest tourist refuge kibo huts at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby bunks for a brief doze but our guide was relentless the descent had to continue for another 10 shattering miles before we reached our camp after 18 hours on the march we were barely coherent yet we had done kilimanjaro this epic day was the high-point of a deluxe assault we had avoided the normal much-trodden marangu route up the mountain and had taken the more beautiful machame trail this required tents and 30 porters the approach march was reminiscent of nepal but kilimanjaro's succession of climates from banana groves through rain-forest through a moss-zone that would delight any japanese temple-gardener through afghanistan into antarctica was more striking and rapid than in the himalaya this is because kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up out of a 3,000 ft plain though by no means the highest it is one of the tallest free-standing mountains in the world it makes its own relatively benign weather and its own flora including peculiar senescant trees which populate the upper slopes like groups of green-haired muppets the experience was not cheap our well-organised 10-day tour cost pounds 1,000 per person including two days recovering in tanzania's game-parks tips to the guides and porters plus entry fees cost another pounds 200 the flight cost pounds 500 and town-dwellers like us had to spend at least pounds 200 each buying cold-weather clothes sleeping bags and so forth the only mountaineering equipment needed was diamox a pill that
