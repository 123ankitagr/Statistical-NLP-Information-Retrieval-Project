february is supposed to be the dry season in tanzania yet kilimanjaro africas highest mountain remained veiled in ominous mist as we drove towards it out of kenya only when we reached its lowest slopes did the old volcano bare a shoulder we piled out of the bus and gazed up at it the ridge of ice and black lava seemed miles up it was in fact three vertical miles above where we stood what on earth had persuaded 12 tourists that they could walk up that the answer was jeanpierre brain a 50yearold french insurance executive in normal life he limited himself to packing opera festivals with middleaged friends now he had coaxed 11 of them including one englishman to share his midlife crisis and climb kilimanjaro in style dressed more like a golfer than a mountaineer jeanpierre thrust his jaw at the distant summit as if wondering whether a twoiron would do the trick the mountain veiled itself again and stayed hidden from us bar the odd glimpse for the next four days that was on a sunday evening by the following thursday night two of those three vertical miles were below us and our doubts had become the disbelief of people about to mount the scaffold it was midnight we were being given early morning tea in tents perched on a ridge of shattered rock 16000ft up the incessant rain that never falls on kilimanjaro in february had been replaced by the driving snow that so rarely dusts its upper slopes according to the notes on the ordnance survey map in the ghastly light of miners lamps strapped to our foreheads we pulled on every stitch of clothing we had and struggled sick and whitefaced out into the night our capable french tourguide eric christin had already told us what to expect we will climb steeply and slowly for seven hours we will stick together behind the tanzanian guide in one group this will require willpower some of you will vomit if you really can not go on tell me and i will send you down with a guide the chaingang set off at a pace so slow that we joked about it at first we climbed disembodiedly inching our personal circles of light up a neverending snowslope of 45 degrees the huge volcanic cone of kilimanjaro remained invisible above and below us thin and frigid air whistled in and out of our lungs one breath per step the french chitchat a feature of the lower slopes died this purgatory continued almost without pause for roughly the time it takes to fly the atlantic such a trial permits only the lowest form of thought an auctioneer from dijon furnished and refurnished his extensive chateau i murmured stalingrad twice as bad like a mantra remembering between throwing up what fun this really was the reward came at dawn the lip of the crater became visible not far above us the huge scale of what we had climbed stretched beneath us down to the violet mass of africa the sun rose behind the sciencefiction peak of mawenzi kilimanjaros little sister by 8am our troupe had reached the rim of the volcano at 19000ft we could gaze into the snowfilled crater and at the surreal glaciers that surround it this was stella point but not the top lightheaded with pride altitude and lack of sleep we all elected to climb for another hour trudging around the rim of the crater to the summit uhuru peak at 19385ft the highest point in africa of the 50 other climbers who had been attempting the separate tourist route up the mountain that night just two stumbled with us to this true summit our heartiness verged on the lunatic two of the party collapsed on the return march around the crater but then to our great relief it became clear why kilimanjaro had to be climbed at night the equatorial sun grilling down on us with pure ultraviolet had melted the top of the mountain into a great barely climbable mound of white slush and black volcanic sand the three guides seized the weakest members of our party and ran them down this great soft scree like marionettes the rest of us staggered down in pursuit losing 4000 hardwon feet in just over an hour we reached the highest tourist refuge kibo huts at lunchtime and collapsed on to grubby bunks for a brief doze but our guide was relentless the descent had to continue for another 10 shattering miles before we reached our camp after 18 hours on the march we were barely coherent yet we had done kilimanjaro this epic day was the highpoint of a deluxe assault we had avoided the normal muchtrodden marangu route up the mountain and had taken the more beautiful machame trail this required tents and 30 porters the approach march was reminiscent of nepal but kilimanjaros succession of climates from banana groves through rainforest through a mosszone that would delight any japanese templegardener through afghanistan into antarctica was more striking and rapid than in the himalaya this is because kilimanjaro shoots abruptly up out of a 3000ft plain though by no means the highest it is one of the tallest freestanding mountains in the world it makes its own relatively benign weather and its own flora including peculiar senescant trees which populate the upper slopes like groups of greenhaired muppets the experience was not cheap our wellorganised 10day tour cost pounds 1000 per person including two days recovering in tanzanias gameparks tips to the guides and porters plus entry fees cost another pounds 200 the flight cost pounds 500 and towndwellers like us had to spend at least pounds 200 each buying coldweather clothes sleeping bags and so forth the only mountaineering equipment needed was diamox a pill that stops altitude sickness
