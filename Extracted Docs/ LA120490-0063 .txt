The Upper Deck trading card company , which is based in Yorba Linda , has signed a five-year contract to sponsor the series of baseball old-timers ' games formerly sponsored by the Equitable . As part of the agreement , Upper Deck will donate a minimum of $ 260,000 to the Baseball Assistance Team , an organization that helps former major and minor league baseball personnel who are in financial need . Upper Deck has grown from a staff of seven people two years ago to 450 employees in four buildings . The `` Heroes of Baseball '' series , which consists of one game at each of the 26 major league stadiums , will add events to make the games more attractive to young fans , according to Bodow .
