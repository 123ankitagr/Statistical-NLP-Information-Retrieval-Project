When people talk about breaking up the BBC to make it more 'market oriented ' , and turning each channel into a separate business , have they thought about what we have , what countries such as the US have where broadcasting is already 'market oriented ' , and what we stand to lose ? Suppose you wanted to hear some music this evening at about 8 o'clock . Radio 1 will be in the middle of a concert relay featuring the Soup Dragons Live At The Marquee . Radio 2 will just be starting Folk On 2 with Dave Swarbrick , Martin Carthy , and Fairport Convention in Birmingham . Radio 3 will be 30 minutes into a live broadcast of the BBC Welsh SO from Cardiff where they are playing a Musorgsky and Shostakovich concert - just an average evening on BBC Radio . Dispatches ( 8.30 C4 ) interviews John Major at 10 Downing Street and includes the first film of the cabinet in session . In the third episode of Sleepers ( 9.30 BBC2 ) Russia 's two stroppy Anglophile agents head for Scotland pursued by the KGB , CIA , MI5 .
