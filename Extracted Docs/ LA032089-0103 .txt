The Supreme Court today overruled South African President Pieter W. Botha 's order to halt the murder trial of six soldiers charged in the stabbing death of a black activist . It marks the second time in four months that Namibia 's highest court has overturned a decision by Botha to grant immunity to soldiers accused of murder in Namibia , also known as South-West Afria . A three-judge panel said the soldiers of Namibia 's South African-led army will have to stand trial for the Nov. 30 , 1986 , killing of Immanuel Shifidi .
