In 1993 and 1994 , the Bundesbank cut short-term interest rates despite ballooning growth in M3 money supply . Next year , the opposite could happen : M3 growth will slow or be altogether reversed , but interest rates are likely to go up . Special factors can be blamed for the fluctuations but , as a practical matter , monetary policy has become divorced from money supply targeting . Yesterday 's decision to leave unchanged the M3 target for next year does not the hold the key to what happens to German short-term interest rates next year . More important is the outlook for medium-term economic growth and inflation . On the inflation front , the picture for the next six months is encouraging : by spring , headline inflation is set to fall to close to the Bundesbank 's 2 per cent target . Thereafter , inflation is set to rise as the economic recovery gathers pace . Third-quarter gross domestic product figures showed a marked acceleration in growth , suggesting that domestic demand is taking over from exports as the engine of recovery . With German GDP growth forecast to come in at 3.1 per cent this year and next , industry is working at close to full capacity , adding to price pressures . The wage round is another risk , and it is distinctly possible that the government will resort to further inflationary tax increases in 1996 in an attempt to plug its spending shortfall . As always , monetary policy is a balancing act , and the Bundesbank will be mindful of the impact of January 's solidarity surcharge on consumer confidence . But the likelihood is that the Bundesbank will launch a pre-emptive strike to nip future inflation in the bud .
