in 1993 and 1994 the bundesbank cut shortterm interest rates despite ballooning growth in m3 money supply next year the opposite could happen m3 growth will slow or be altogether reversed but interest rates are likely to go up special factors can be blamed for the fluctuations but as a practical matter monetary policy has become divorced from money supply targeting yesterdays decision to leave unchanged the m3 target for next year does not the hold the key to what happens to german shortterm interest rates next year more important is the outlook for mediumterm economic growth and inflation on the inflation front the picture for the next six months is encouraging by spring headline inflation is set to fall to close to the bundesbanks 2 per cent target thereafter inflation is set to rise as the economic recovery gathers pace thirdquarter gross domestic product figures showed a marked acceleration in growth suggesting that domestic demand is taking over from exports as the engine of recovery with german gdp growth forecast to come in at 31 per cent this year and next industry is working at close to full capacity adding to price pressures the wage round is another risk and it is distinctly possible that the government will resort to further inflationary tax increases in 1996 in an attempt to plug its spending shortfall as always monetary policy is a balancing act and the bundesbank will be mindful of the impact of januarys solidarity surcharge on consumer confidence but the likelihood is that the bundesbank will launch a preemptive strike to nip future inflation in the bud
