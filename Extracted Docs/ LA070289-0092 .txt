a federal judge in nashville has overturned a tennessee law requiring girls age 17 or under to get their parents permission for an abortion the national planned parenthood federation and the american civil liberties union of tennessee sought a preliminary injunction against the law but us district judge john t nixon said there was no need for an injunction because the statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face the law would have made it a misdemeanor for a doctor to perform an abortion on a minor without first obtaining written permission from her parents or guardian it allows exceptions if the parents are divorced if the girl wins a court waiver or if one parent can not be found within a reasonable time and manner nixon said that phrase did not give the doctor notice as to when his actions will violate the statute
