A federal prison escapee suspected of robbing a Bank of America branch in Fountain Valley on Tuesday is the subject of an intensive manhunt by the FBI and U.S. marshals . Manuel Garcia Bracamonte , 33 , who was serving a 25-year prison term in the federal prison at Lompoc , was photographed by surveillance cameras Tuesday at the bank at 16192 Harbor Blvd . -- the same branch he allegedly robbed in 1986 , said FBI spokesman Bucky Cox . Bank spokesman Tom Chapman said the robber got $ 3,200 . Bracamonte , of Los Angeles County , was charged with 14 bank robberies between September and November , 1986 , five of which occurred in Orange County , Cox said . He was convicted of four . Bracamonte escaped from Lompoc on April 21 with inmate Albert Gudino , Deputy U.S . Marshal Mark Pirtle said . The two prisoners were working in the kitchen and hid in boxes which were taken outside the gates on a forklift . `` When they got into the area where the trucks were supposed to pick them up , they popped out of the boxes and ran toward the trees , '' Pirtle said . `` Gudino , an older man with bad knees , only made it about 100 yards before he fell to the ground . '' Gudino is `` an old escape artist '' and may have purposely acted as a decoy to ensure Bracamonte 's escape , Pirtle said . Bracamonte often carried a .38-caliber revolver in his waistband and should be considered dangerous , Pirtle said . Bracamonte is `` big into heroin , '' Pirtle said . FBI spokesman Cox said , `` I certainly anticipate he 'll try to rob another bank . '' Anyone with information should call the FBI at ( 213 ) 477-6565 or the U.S . Marshal 's Service at ( 213 ) 894-2485 .
