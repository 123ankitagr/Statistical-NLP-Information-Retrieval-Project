The U.S. Chamber of Commerce pushed for the soon-to-be-announced Nobel Peace Prize in a secret campaign so brash it embarrassed even some of its own employees , according to documents and a former worker . The business federation nicknamed its campaign `` Special Project . '' It courted U.S. lawmakers , world leaders and a former prize winner to get itself nominated for the award . The chamber 's pitch was that it has helped bring democracy and a free enterprise economy to Eastern Europe and the Third World . Last year , the chamber drafted a nominating letter that said it `` richly deserves international recognition for its bold and visionary leadership in the cause of human freedom , which is a prerequisite to world peace . '' The chamber was nominated by David A. Morse , a New York attorney who was director general of the International Labor Organization , and Sen. Richard G. Lugar ( R-Ind. ) . `` I 'd be embarrassed if I were promoting myself that much , '' said Barry King , the organization 's media relations director until June . `` It seems to me the people who have won it did n't need to toot their own horn so much . '' But Milt Mitler , chamber vice president for public liaison , said Wednesday , `` It was not a campaign . We were nominated for the prize by Sen. Lugar and Mr. Morse . We had to give them both historic information on what the chamber does or has done . ''
