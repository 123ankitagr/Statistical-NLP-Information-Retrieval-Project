world commodity prices sank to an alltime low in real terms last year according to the world bank in its recentlypublished annual report the bank attributed this is bleak news for the developing countries to a worldwide slowdown in economic activity a trend which has only worsened this year economic difficulties in the soviet union and in central and eastern europe generally tended to lower commodity prices except for basic food stuffs the report continued although price indexes for cereals and fats were slightly higher than in 1990 beverage prices were down by 59 per cent and sugar prices fell by 285 per cent in fact coffee cocoa and tea prices hit alltime lows in inflation adjusted terms one of the world banks commodity specialists mr takamasa akiyama said worldwide recession had only a short and mediumterm effect on the price declines basically the difficulty in commodity production is the vast productivity increases of the producing countries there are a number of factors contributing to productivity increases but one of them is the world bank itself according to some of its critics including mr kevin watkins senior economist at oxfam the banks structural adjustment programme has contributed to the chronic price depression by encouraging production of commodities for world markets which are already saturated mr watkins said it had pushed production he said on the ideological assumption that each country must produce what it produced best according to its comparative advantage whether or not there was too much of a commodity around it also wanted to help the developing countries repay their debts should world bank lending be guided by the demand of the western banks that is a question it ought to address mr watkins said the bank has long recognised the danger in backing overproduction and it has often tried to restrict such lending mr watkins said however that he doubted that the banks country departments talked to each other about their loans as one example he cited support of palm oil production in both malaysia and indonesia two huge suppliers whose output significantly affects world price the bank said it tried to limit commodity loans to countries that did not have investment alternatives or simply needed to improve their current productive capacity however between 1983 and 1986 it approved 15 projects that were expected to lead to increased coffee production mr akiyama said the bank had little choice but to help a country increase its productivity lest it lose out to more efficient producers
