sir japans whisky and shochu taxation as discussed by your correspondent kojiro shiojiri april 20 and by ronald brown and tim jackson april 27 raises more questions than answers why should japan be held to account for an ec regulation which prevents distillers here from marketing whisky with less than 40 per cent alcohol when most drinkers add water to reduce their drink to around 20 per cent anyway and why dont european distillers produce shochu the contents of which are no secret if they want to do business in japan surely the japanese are entitled to point out that if importers produce whisky of 20 per cent proof and shochu alongside other white spirits both of which the japanese consumer clearly demands then the tax position will no longer be an issue james bourlet economic research council 239 shaftesbury avenue london wc2h 8pj
