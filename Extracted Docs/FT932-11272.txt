Sir , Japan 's whisky and shochu taxation as discussed by your correspondent Kojiro Shiojiri ( April 20 ) and by Ronald Brown and Tim Jackson ( April 27 ) raises more questions than answers . Why should Japan be held to account for an EC regulation . which prevents distillers here from marketing whisky with less than 40 per cent alcohol - when most drinkers add water to reduce their drink to around 20 per cent anyway ? And why do n't European distillers produce shochu , the contents of which are no secret , if they want to do business in Japan ? Surely the Japanese are entitled to point out that if importers produce whisky of 20 per cent proof and shochu alongside other white spirits , both of which the Japanese consumer clearly demands , then the tax position will no longer be an issue .
