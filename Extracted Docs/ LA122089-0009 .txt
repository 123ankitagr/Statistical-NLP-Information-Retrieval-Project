Was Jackson Video Hijacked ? `` A Current Affair '' was ready to air an exclusive home video of Michael Jackson on Monday and Tuesday nights , until Jackson 's lawyers showed up at the last minute and prevented the show from running the video as planned , according to the syndicated show 's executive producer , Gerald Stone . `` A Current Affair '' had gotten the video from Steve Howell , a cameraman who worked with Jackson on some videos and had taken extra footage of Jackson around his house . Stone said Howell told `` A Current Affair '' that Jackson gave up the rights to the video , but Jackson 's lawyers claimed the video was `` hijacked , '' and Howell did not have legal access to it . `` A Current Affair '' smelled a news story , and on Monday did a piece on the confusion surrounding the tape ( another segment was scheduled for Tuesday night ) . While the program used excerpts from the tape as part of the news story , `` in deference to Michael Jackson , we did n't run the whole thing , '' Stone said . He added that Howell denied Jackson 's attorneys ' accusations . Shauna Snow
