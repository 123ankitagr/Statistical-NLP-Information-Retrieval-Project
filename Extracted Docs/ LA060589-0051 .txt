transplant doctors predict that pigs will become a main source of donor organs for people once the many technical problems of crossspecies transplantation are resolved while primates such as chimpanzees and baboons might be a better match pigs are cheaper more plentiful and easier to breed says dr hugh auchincloss jr assistant professor of surgery at harvard university what could change i suppose is that we could become better at making artificial organs than we are now then we wouldnt need the animal organs but i dont see that as coming first auchincloss said last week at the annual meeting of the american society of transplant physicians only 50 to 60 chimpanzees are available in any given year for all types of research auchincloss said it doesnt make any sense to use chimpanzees because youre going to make such a small impact in the wellbeing of humans and youll make people so mad because it is where they focus from the point of view of animal rights understandably so he said if you can eat the pig im not sure you cant transplant the liver said arthur caplan director of the center for biomedical ethics at the university of minnesota
