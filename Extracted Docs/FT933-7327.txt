British Airways is to start weekly flights between London and Santiago , the Chilean capital , from October 29 . BA will operate Boeing 747-400 aircraft via Sao Paulo , Brazil , leaving London on Thursdays and returning the following day , writes David Pilling in Santiago . There have been no direct flights between London and Santiago since British Caledonian , which merged with BA in 1988 , stopped operating the route shortly after the Falklands war .
