question my exhusband and i pay the rent on our two daughters redondo beach apartment while they are getting their college degrees the second month they were in the apartment the resident manager requested cash payment of the rent saying he would provide a receipt after we verified that his name was on the lease agreement as manager we gave him the $ 800 cash he however failed to sign the receipt the girls brought it back to him to get his signature on it he said he forgot to sign the receipt he now says that he has the legal right to demand cash payment of the rent and thats what he wants we dont appreciate that attitude but it was expensive in terms of both time and money to move our daughters we hesitate to force an issue only to have our daughters evicted i am afraid that one of these months he will again forget to sign the receipt but will remember that the girls paid no rent the lease agreement says nothing about the method of payment of the rent does he have the right to demand cash payment of the rent is there anything that we can do answer since the lease agreement says nothing about the method of payment the manager can not require you to pay the rent in cash until he gives you a 30day notice to change the terms of your daughters tenancy once he gives you such a notice you will have to pay the rent in cash although you can demand that the manager give you such a notice it wont do you any good in the long run its probably better not to rock the boat just make sure that the manager signs the rent receipts you are entitled signed receipts for your cash rent payments owners owe interest on last months rent q i own a los angeles apartment and i am writing in reference to the nov 25 apartment life column under landlord raises deposit when he raises rent you write the new law requiring landlords to pay interest on security deposits and last months rents requires them to pay interest on such deposits to tenants every five years the la ordinances no 168363 and no 166373 require landlords to pay interest only on security deposits and not on last months rents the rent stabilization division on the ordinance hot line 213 6247368 confirmed that the answer in the column is incorrect a there is a conflict between state and federal law that is likely causing the confusion under federal tax law the last months rent is considered income when collected at that point the income is taxable under federal law under state landlordtenant law last months rents are considered deposits according to jim fleck director of research for the rsd the interest payments apply to all deposits no matter how they are labeled including last months rents it costs landlords to move tenants out q in the oct 27 column landlord pays extra to move baby you referred to the rights of a landlord when a tenant adds a baby to the apartment does that information refer to santa monica rent control as well also what are the rights of a santa monica landlord when a tenant moves out and places someone else in that apartment without the landlords approval a the column said that a los angeles landlord can evict tenants from a unit in order to move in family members he must however pay the tenants relocation fees which in los angeles are either $ 2000 or $ 5000 tenants with minor children seniors or the handicapped get the $ 5000 others get $ 2000 in santa monica you can also evict tenants to move in certain family members and you must also pay relocation fees but the fees in santa monica are higher and structured differently than those in los angeles in santa monica the fees are based upon the size of the unit and include an extra $ 1000 for tenants with minor children seniors or the handicapped for santa monica the amounts are as follows singlebachelor apartments $ 3000 onebedroom apartments $ 3750 twobedroom apartments $ 4250 threebedroom apartments $ 5250 fourormorebedroom apartments $ 5500 when a tenant moves out and places an unauthorized subtenant in the unit without the landlords approval under most circumstances you are able to evict the unlawful subtenant exceptions to this rule of thumb may include the following 1 the tenant is on an unexpired lease agreement under which hes responsible for the unpaid rent until the unit is rerented if you unreasonably refuse to accept qualified replacement renters you lose any further rent claim against the tenant or 2 the unauthorized subtenant had lived in the unit before the tenant of record moved out and you knew about it accepted rent even if you merely accepted rent from the tenant of record and not the unauthorized subtenant and made no effort to get him out of the unit in this second example most judges in california will rule that you have waived your right to evict by accepting the rent and taking no action to evict there may be other exceptions so check with your attorney before giving your tenant notice to move postema is the editor of apartment age
