the monopolies and mergers commission mmc blocked the proposed acquisition of british international helicopters bih by aberdeen-based bond helicopters yesterday on the ground that it was against the public interest bih was put into administration last december after the death of robert maxwell who had acquired the helicopter company from british airways in 1986 the mmc concluded yesterday that a merger of bih with bond helicopters would leave only two operators each with about half the market providing helicopter services on the north sea to the uk offshore oil and gas industry the mmc said that risked reducing competition and forcing up prices for north sea offshore helicopter services the biggest north sea operator is bristow helicopters with about 51 per cent of the market followed by bond with 29 per cent and bih with the remaining 20 per cent bih also operates a scheduled passenger helicopter service between penzance and the scilly isles an earlier bid by bristow for the former maxwell-owned business was withdrawn after it was referred to the mmc the mmc decision was criticised by mr stephen bond the aberdeen company's managing director as demonstrating a complete lack of understanding of the industry he said it failed to recognise that foreign competitors were preparing to attack the uk offshore market the decision has been made from a uk point of view when it should have been looked at from an overall european perspective he said there are already 11 other european operators working in non-uk waters and this decision severely weakens the uk helicopter industry's ability to compete effectively and maintain market share mr bond said klm helicopters and its us partner era had recently applied for an operating licence for uk waters the mmc however said demand for helicopter services on the north sea was likely to remain stable or decline over the next few years it argued that if the merger went ahead neither of the two remaining operators would compete strongly for market share and prices would tend to rise the mmc also said there was unlikely to be any successful competition from a new firm entering the market
