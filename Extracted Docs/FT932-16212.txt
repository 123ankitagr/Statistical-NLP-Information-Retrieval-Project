THE CRASH of a North Sea helicopter with the loss of 11 lives in March last year was caused by pilot error , Sheriff Alexander Jessop ruled yesterday in Aberdeen . But he said Shell , the oil company , probably contributed to the deaths of some people who survived the crash but later drowned . The Tiger helicopter , operated by Bristows , plunged into the sea seconds after taking off in very bad weather conditions from Shell 's Cormorant Alpha platform . The sheriff said Shell had ignored statutory regulations demanding that a standby vessel be informed when helicopter flights were to take place . Shell Expro yesterday said it had taken steps immediately after the accident to rectify its procedures .
