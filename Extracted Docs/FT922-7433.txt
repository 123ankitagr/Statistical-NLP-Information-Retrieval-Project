a reduction in the number of house repossessions would give a strong stimulus to house prices according to an article in the latest bank of england quarterly bulletin it argues that in the short run house prices respond more rapidly to reduced repossessions than to interest rate changes according to research by the banks economics division a reduction in the number of house repossessions by 20000 for one year there were about 75000 last year would increase house prices by about 5 per cent above rises that would otherwise have occurred the increase in prices would in turn reduce the number of house repossessions by a further 6000 by increasing the value of housing equity a second simulation shows that a reduction in house repossessions of 4000 would cause house prices to rise by 17 per cent in the first year as well as the general cost of initiating a possession the current scale of possessions is having a significant effect on house prices the article says the authors suggest that that depressing effect explains recent efforts by lenders to initiate mortgage rescue schemes
