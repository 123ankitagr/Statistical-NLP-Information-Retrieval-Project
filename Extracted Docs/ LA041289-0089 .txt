A state Senate panel Tuesday approved a ban on commercial fishing of white croaker in Santa Monica Bay . The Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Wildlife , in an 8-0 vote , approved a bill that also would prohibit commercial fishing of white croaker near the White Point Sewage Outfall near the Palos Verdes Peninsula . Tests of the water in the area show it has `` extremely high levels of toxic contamination '' and that the white croaker species in particular is `` unfit for human consumption , '' said Sen. Herschel Rosenthal ( D-Los Angeles ) , who authored the bill . Although authorities thought commercial fishing near the outfall had stopped after tests disclosed the problem in 1985 , they found evidence last year that fishermen were catching white croaker and `` those fish are sold to unsuspecting consumers , '' Rosenthal said . He said his bill , which was sent to the Senate Appropriations Committee for another vote , was limited to white croaker because it is not a transient species and therefore susceptible to site-specific contamination . Another bill approved by the committee would authorize the state director of fish and game to close contaminated areas to commercial fishing .
