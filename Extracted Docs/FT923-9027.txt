when piet norval and wayne ferreira met goran ivanisevic and goran prpic in a tennis doubles semi-final the other day it signalled a small piece of olympic history both pairs were already assured of medals this meant that norval and ferreira were the first south africans to win olympic medals since boxers daniel bekker and william meyers and 400 metres runner malcolm spence collected a silver and two bronzes in rome in 1960 the two gorans were the first ever to win olympic medals in the name of croatia after the match ferreira said it is possible that by us winning south africa's first medal our fellow countrymen will take courage and compete better the nationalist element played an important role in the match up until now the only south african finalist has been a swimmer in the 50 m free-style peter williams who came fourth xolile yawa 13 th in the 10,000 m on monday and the first black south african in an olympic final seemed to have escaped his notice but sportsmen in competition can be blinkered there have been many other happy returns in these games erika salumae won estonia's first gold since the palmy days when they were a power in weightlifting and wrestling and before the soviet union invaded after her victory in the women's cycling sprint salumae said happily it's marvellous i think that at the moment they are throwing a huge party in my country it's very exciting it might have been estonia's first gold in cycling but it was salumae's second she won in seoul when representing the soviet union the toniste brothers tonu and toomas who collected their yachting bronze medal for estonia in gangster suits won silver for the soviet union in 1988 frankie fredericks silver for namibia in the 100 m was that country's first olympic medal ever but then it did not exist as an independent country four years ago the barcelona games have also marked the debut of several semi-countries fedor kasspu won the gold in the 75 kg weightlifting in the dull green of the unified team but when he stood on the podium the audience had the privilege of hearing the olympic debut of the moldovan national anthem there are 172 countries entered in these olympics a record but for 1996 the atlanta organising committee is planning to welcome 190 to the centenary games atlanta calculates there will be 13 more teams from what used to be the soviet union plus five countries that no one has yet thought of catalonia for example the barcelona games will probably mark the only appearance of the unified team they might also mark the solitary olympic entry of bosnia-hercegovina and of the independent olympic participants which is serbia and montenegro under a five-ringed flag of convenience the war in the balkans has cast a strange glow over the olympics ivanisevic never slow to take the moral and political high ground proclaimed after one five-set victory today i was tired but i think that winning a medal for my country croatia gives me strength to do anything mehmed skender the weightlifter was in a trench in zenica with a machine gun when he was selected for the bosnian team he has surrendered the hell of life in bosnia for the hell of the olympic village incapable of performing at anything like his best unable to reach his family at home we are here to show the world that we are alive and that we exist said mladan talic of the olympic committee of bosnia-hercegovina these games have also seen the continued spread of medals to developing countries on wednesday evening ximena restrepo came third in the women's 400 m to win colombia's first athletics medal the increased number of events has also helped put unaccustomed names on the medal table indonesia won its first olympic medal a silver in archery in seoul in barcelona it has already won two golds two silvers and a bronze all in badminton which is an olympic sport for the first time but the biggest redistribution of medals has been to the people's republic of china it re-entered olympic competition in los angeles in 1984 with 32 medals it won 28 in seoul its total in barcelona is already way past that a lot of eyes in barcelona have focused on the gallant performances of the many small or weak nations but over them all looms the growing power of one very big nation
