nestled in the whittier hills sits a ridgetop plateau of pristine prime real estate with a view of the pacific on a clear day the city of whittier first sought to make this the home of a nixon library more than two decades ago and again seven years ago and four more years ago but today the champagne toasting the dedication of the $ 21million library flows in yorba linda nixons birthplace and nowchosen resting place for the former presidents selected archives we were terribly shocked former whittier mayor victor lopez said recently of nixons decision to locate his private library elsewhere it would have been a boost to whittier whittier college and the whole thing we were terribly disappointed gene chandler another of the citys former mayors added we always figured that whittier was his home it is easy to understand whittiers claim to the 37th president although richard m nixon was born in yorba linda it was in whittier that he spent his high school and college years he met his wife in whittier and practiced law here and whittier republicans helped him start his political career a successful bid to unseat democratic incumbent jerry voorhis in a congressional district that encompassed the city and nearby communities nixon entered whittier as a child he left it as a figure in national politics we felt we had a complete inside track historically chandler said with whittier representing most of his life it wasnt to be whittiers first effort to claim the library began shortly after nixons 1968 presidential triumph over vice president hubert h humphrey whittier college helped to lead the bid for the library which enjoyed strong community support his presidency was important at the time to the college said joseph dmohowski special collections librarian at whittier college it attracted a lot of students to the college the city presented the thenpresident with a handsome oversize leatherbound and clothlined tome titled the richard m nixon presidential library whittier california it contained pictorial highlights of whittier and nixons career intimately connecting the two on thick cardboard pages it would be a great honor to see your presidential library standing on that whittier hilltop purchased with hopes just as high wrote thenmayor keith miller and frederick binder who was whittier colleges president local nixon friends and supporters also commissioned the nixon trail a site feasibility study for the richard m nixon presidential library prepared by a prestigious architectural firm the study contained a picture of a threedimensional rendering of the library which was envisioned sitting on a ridge among 120 acres of whittier hillside above where the citys landfill is now located the proposed complex consisted of two sets of concentric circles terraced down the hillside there were also artists conceptions of the library interior the central gallery would feature nasa rockets and space capsules which at the time is what the artists guessed would be remembered about the nixon administration indeed the library study was submitted shortly after the first moon landing in december 1969 in addition the studys authors proposed a historical trail winding through whittier that included stops at the site of the favorite sons old law firm wingert bewley nixon three schools he attended four former nixon residences the site of his fathers store the quaker church and the location of his wedding reception clearly everything was on course then came watergate although most whittier residents remained sympathetic to nixon the impetus for the library literally dissolved as the scandal forced nixons resignation in august 1974 choosing a location for his archives became a low priority there was no discussion of the library for a long time after he left office said bruce martin executive manager of the whittier chamber of commerce the trials were still going on i think everything went on hold had it not been for watergate the library would have been here said clint harris a lifelong nixon friend and whittier resident who used to scrimmage head to head with the future president on the whittier college football team whittier though was a finalist for the site along with yorba linda and san clemente which was the location of nixons western white house this time whittiers offer had shrunk to 20 acres but it included the same spectacular ridge lopez remembered attending a dinner party at the home of local nixon boosters ed and ruth shannon nixons representatives were there along with most of the city council it was a gorgeous evening lopez said the hills we were overlooking that was the nixon site we talked financing and so forth we were willing to put in the road sewage water and to give them the land it was all positive they liked the site the view and the town when they left that evening they said it looks pretty good to us in the very next days paper lopez said he learned that san clemente had been selected in her personal files ruth shannon said she has a letter from nixon describing his vacillation and agonizing he said if i followed my heart it would go to whittier he felt it should be at san clemente because of his years at the white house shannon said by 1986 however an unexpected problem had thwarted the san clemente plans and the search for a library site was on again whittier officials began their third and final bid for it at one point the city wooed nixon representatives by pitching a tent and a display at the proposed site chandler said but for the most part the lobbying went on behind the scenes it helped that yorba linda already had preserved nixons birthplace as a historic site and could offer an adjacent land parcel for the library so yorba linda a sleepy orange county suburb is looking forward to an estimated 350000 library visitors a year and the tourist dollars they will leave behind whittier a city still trying to rebuild from the october 1987 earthquake will sorely miss the income and the prestige city officials said
