dear eating right how can i serve a christmas meal that includes the traditional foods my family is accustomed to without all the fat that we usually have roberta kingsley los angeles dear roberta if your holiday menu is like the average one roast meat with butterbased gravy lots of creamy vegetables and rich desserts plus all the snack foods as much as half of the calories can come from fat one obvious way to cut down on fat and calories in meat courses is to eat just three ounces of meat about the size of a deck of cards most people eat more than twice that amount at this time of year another idea is to roast poultry without the skin so that it looks delicious when served instead of removing the skin before eating this makes diners feel deprived forget about packaged stuffing and pasta side dishes and make your own using lowfat dairy products fatfree substitutes or oil instead of butter and margarine and ground turkey sausage instead of pork whole grains such as bulgur and couscous cooked with chicken or vegetable broths make unusual side dishes if you do make dressing cook it outside the bird so it doesnt soak up any fatty drippings dessert doesnt have to be radically lean either its ok to indulge in treats as long as the fat and calories have been reduced substitute raisins chopped apples dates and currants for highfat ingredients such as chocolate and nuts then dollop with whipped topping instead of whipped cream have a small serving of pumpkin pie instead of pecan which can have almost twice the calories and fat sugarfree gelatin desserts and angel food cake are two less fattening dessert options dieting is not a shortterm thing says denise rector a registered dietitian and member of the american heart assns nutrition committee which each year develops a holidays a la heart menu brochure its important to maintain healthy eating habits even at this time of year dont starve all week then splurge on the holidays she says the aha brochure features recipes that can be put together entirely in advance or on the same day the turkey dishes for example take just 10 minutes to prepare the desserts are creamy and richtasting you wont compromise taste rector says to obtain a free copy of ahas healthy holiday cooking booklet which includes the following holiday menu write to american heart assn greater los angeles affiliate 3550 wilshire blvd 5th floor los angeles calif 90010 or call 800 heart la cranberry salad game hens with mushroomwine sauce appleraisin apricot stuffing broccoli with sunshine sauce easy eggless cocoa cake easy eggless cocoa cake 1 12 cups flour 1 cup sugar 14 cup unsweetened cocoa powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 14 teaspoon salt 1 cup water 14 cup oil 1 tablespoon vinegar 1 teaspoon vanilla 2 tablespoons powdered sugar combine flour sugar cocoa powder baking soda and salt add water oil vinegar and vanilla and stir until smooth pour into greased and floured 8inchsquare pan bake at 350 degrees 35 to 40 minutes or until wood pick inserted in center comes out clean cool then remove from pan when cooled completely dust with powdered sugar makes 9 servings nutrient analysis of holiday foods calories fat cholesterol sodium type of food grams milligrams milligrams breads and grain dishes bread stuffing dry type from mix 1 cup 500 31 0 1254 bread stuffing moist type with egg 1 cup 420 26 67 1023 dinner rolls 1 roll 85 2 0 155 macaroni and cheese from home recipe 1 cup 430 22 44 1086 desserts baked custard 1 cup 305 15 278 209 cream pie piece 16 pie 455 23 8 369 pecan pie slice 16 pie 575 32 95 305 pumpkin pie slice 16 pie 320 17 109 325 fudge chocolate plain 1 ounce 115 3 1 54 gingerbread slice 19 of cake 175 4 1 192 fruitcake dark slice 132 of cake 165 7 20 67 meats and poultry ham light cure roasted lean and fat 3 ounces 205 14 53 1009 ham canned roasted 3 ounces 140 7 35 908 beef roast oven cooked lean andfat 3 ounces 315 26 72 54 beef roast oven cooked lean only 22 ounces 150 9 49 45 leg of lamb roasted lean and fat 3 ounces 205 13 78 57 leg of lamb roasted lean only 26 ounces 140 6 65 50 pork rib roasted lean and fat 3 ounces 270 20 69 37 pork rib roasted lean only 25 ounces 175 10 56 33 duck roasted flesh only 12 duck 445 25 197 144 turkey light and dark meat roasted 3 pieces 145 4 65 60 source united states department of agriculture home and garden bulletin number 72
