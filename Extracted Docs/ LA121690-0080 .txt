Dear Eating Right : How can I serve a Christmas meal that includes the traditional foods my family is accustomed to without all the fat that we usually have ? -- ROBERTA KINGSLEY Los Angeles Dear Roberta : If your holiday menu is like the average one -- roast meat with butter-based gravy , lots of creamy vegetables and rich desserts , plus all the snack foods -- as much as half of the calories can come from fat . One obvious way to cut down on fat and calories in meat courses is to eat just three ounces of meat -- about the size of a deck of cards . Most people eat more than twice that amount at this time of year . Another idea is to roast poultry without the skin so that it looks delicious when served instead of removing the skin before eating . This makes diners feel deprived . Forget about packaged stuffing and pasta side dishes and make your own , using low-fat dairy products , fat-free substitutes or oil instead of butter and margarine , and ground turkey sausage instead of pork . Whole grains such as bulgur and couscous cooked with chicken or vegetable broths make unusual side dishes . If you do make dressing , cook it outside the bird so it does n't soak up any fatty drippings . Dessert does n't have to be radically lean either : It 's OK to indulge in treats as long as the fat and calories have been reduced . Substitute raisins , chopped apples , dates and currants for high-fat ingredients such as chocolate and nuts , then dollop with whipped topping instead of whipped cream . Have a small serving of pumpkin pie instead of pecan , which can have almost twice the calories and fat . Sugar-free gelatin desserts and angel food cake are two less fattening dessert options . `` Dieting is not a short-term thing , '' says Denise Rector , a registered dietitian and member of the American Heart Assn . 's Nutrition Committee , which each year develops a `` Holidays a la Heart '' menu brochure . `` It 's important to maintain healthy eating habits even at this time of year . Do n't starve all week then splurge on the holidays , '' she says . The AHA brochure features recipes that can be put together entirely in advance or on the same day . The turkey dishes , for example , take just 10 minutes to prepare . The desserts are creamy and rich-tasting . `` You wo n't compromise taste , '' Rector says .
