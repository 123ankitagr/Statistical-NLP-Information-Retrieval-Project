A state resolution proposed on Tuesday asks businesses to adopt an environmental code of conduct if they want California 's two biggest pension funds to invest in them . The Public Employees Retirement System and State Teachers Retirement System would be asked to consider companies ' ecological track records before investing money in them , under the resolution introduced by state Sen. Gary K. Hart ( D-Santa Barbara ) and sponsored by Democratic Controller Gray Davis . The two funds have total assets of about $ 85 billion . The pension funds would be asked to assess whether companies comply with the so-called Valdez Principles , a 10-point environmental agenda for corporations formulated by the national Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies , or CERES , after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill in Alaska last year . By adopting the code , the companies would agree to protect the biosphere , conserve natural resources , reduce waste and include an ecologist on their boards . `` We must encourage the development of an 'environmental ethic ' in corporate America . Americans will not accept pollution in the name of profit , '' said Davis , a trustee for both pension funds . Davis said one of the pension funds -- PERS -- already has agreed to ask 27 major companies it invests funds with to state how their policies compare to the Valdez Principles . So far , he said , eight companies have agreed to the plan : Aetna , Amoco , Chevron , Eastman Kodak , Mobil , Oryx Energy , Texaco and Union Carbide . `` Shareholder activism is something we feel more confident we can get bipartisan support for ( in the Legislature ) than a divestiture policy , '' said Mary Raftery of California Public Interest Research Group , which supports Hart 's legislation .
