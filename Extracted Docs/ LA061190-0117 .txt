Oscar-winning actress Shirley MacLaine says her recent knee operation probably added 15 years to her dancing career . `` I had a video taken of the operation . The doctor said it was the best movie I ever made , '' said MacLaine , who is in town preparing for Tuesday 's opening of a national performance tour . The surgery to repair torn ligaments and a dislocated kneecap came after she was hurt while rehearsing a dance number earlier this spring . MacLaine , 56 , says she lifted weights and exercised the knee underwater to rebuild her strength . `` It was my first operation ever , and I could have seen it as a tragedy , '' she said . `` But it slowed me down to reflect , so I 've almost finished another book . I think it has given me another 15 years of dancing . '' The veteran actress won best actress honors for the 1982 film `` Terms of Endearment . '' The actress-singer-dancer and best-selling author has written several metaphysical books , including `` Out on a Limb '' and `` Dancing in Light . '' Her next movie project is to play silent movie star Louise Brooks in a biographical film .
