runoff election duke who said he left the klan in 1980 but still lists his home phone number as the new orleans klan office delivered a blow to local state and national republican leaders with the victory saturday they quickly disavowed his election not a republican david duke is not a republican republican national chairman lee atwater said in a statement released by the party saturday night hes a pretender a charlatan and a political opportunist who is looking for any organization he can find to try to legitimize his views of racial and religious bigotry and intolerance we repudiate him in his views and we will take steps to see that he is disenfranchised from our party if he is declared the official winner atwater said party officials in washington said that if duke is certified the winner atwater will hold an executive meeting of the republican national committee to consider a motion of censure that was called the political equivalent of excommunication the motion would condemn duke and deny him any form of party aid or assistance many other political and civic leaders also opposed duke he espouses the same philosophies of many republicans being against affirmative action and setasides state rep quentin dastugue said the problem is that he backs it up with racism and bigotry efforts by bush reagan in the last week of the campaign bush reagan atwater and nearly every republican politician in the state threw their support behind treen letters from bush promoting treens candidacy arrived at most homes in the district by election day and a radio advertisement by reagan urged voters to support treen treens campaign sought to remind the voters of dukes past as a neonazi follower of george lincoln rockwell and as the imperial wizard of a branch of the klan in new orleans the roman catholic archbishop urged voters not to vote for duke while the president of loyola university dispatched 785 letters to alumni in the district suggesting that they not vote for duke but duke supporters said that reagan and bush who received more than 80 of the vote here in their presidential campaigns were out of their element in this campaign reagans never eaten at the popeyes chicken where i grew up said joseph breau 31 an electronics engineer he never went to the time saver store where i go slime and sham the people saw through the slime and the sham being spewed forth by our competition said howie farrell dukes campaign manager what does reagan know about this place and the people of metairie the only thing he knows is that when he goes from the airport to new orleans this is where they hold up the traffic for two hours so he can get through saturdays election was dukes latest foray into politics in 1975 he ran for a state senate seat making no attempt
