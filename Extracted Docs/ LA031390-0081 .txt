Gov . James J. Florio signed into law a bill to lower New Jersey 's car insurance rates by 20 % . Allstate Insurance Co. Vice President Edward Young said the firm would file suit within 30 days on the grounds that the law violates constitutional protections of due process . New Jersey 's insurance rates average $ 1,000 a year . The bill eliminates the Joint Underwriting Assn. , a state-operated pool for high-risk drivers that has a $ 3.1-billion debt . A $ 222 per car annual tab to keep the pool from bankruptcy will be dropped . The law requires the insurance industry to pay $ 1.4 billion of the pool 's debt .
