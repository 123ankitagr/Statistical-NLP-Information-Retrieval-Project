After a sluggish first half , El Toro showed why it is Orange County 's top-ranked high school football team , cruising to a 39-7 win over Santa Monica Thursday night at Mission Viejo High School . El Toro 's defense limited Santa Monica to 96 yards in the first half . But the Chargers held only a 14-0 halftime lead . `` Who was sluggish in the first half , Santa Monica 's offense ? '' El Toro Coach Bob Johnson asked . In its three previous victories , El Toro outscored its opponents , 116-6 . El Toro needed two big plays to score early against Santa Monica . El Toro scored on its first possession when quarterback Rob Johnson found Darren Doalson on a slant pattern for a 40-yard touchdown pass . Johnson completed 19 of 25 passes for 210 yards and two touchdowns . El Toro scored its other first-half touchdown after the Vikings ' Rashon Ivy fumbled a punt return at the Santa Monica 25-yard line . Jason Rojas scored on the next play with a run up the middle . Santa Monica ( 1-1-1 ) made a threat early in the second half after defensive back Jim Ramming recovered a fumble by Doalson , who had caught a Johnson pass in the flat . Ramming ran the ball back to the El Toro 11 , and one play later , Demarco Scott scored on a six-yard run . `` That 's high school football , '' Johnson said . `` Plays like that fumble happen ; maybe that 's what gives me gray hairs . '' After the turnover , the Chargers ' offense kicked it in gear , scoring on its next four possessions . Running back Bret Sanders , who had 79 yards in 13 carries , scored on runs of four and one yards .
