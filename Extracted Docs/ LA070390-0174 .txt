Emperor Akihito wants Japanese to contribute to charity or the environment rather than sending him coronation gifts , and no gifts will be accepted from non-Japanese , officials said today . Only certain Japanese can send gifts , and the type of item also is limited , they added . Akihito , 56 , who became emperor in January , 1989 , upon the death of his father , Emperor Hirohito , is to be formally enthroned Nov. 12 . The ceremony had to await the end of a yearlong formal mourning period . An official of the Imperial Household Agency , which oversees palace affairs , said many people had been reported hoping to send coronation gifts . He noted , however , that Chief Cabinet Secretary Misoji Sakamoto declared after a regular Cabinet meeting today that the emperor `` appreciates the desire of people to offer presents , but he strongly wishes contributions to the promotion of public welfare and maintenance of a green environment instead . '' The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said gifts will be accepted only from the Cabinet , the two houses of Parliament , local governments and groups of Japanese living abroad . Gifts will not be accepted from any foreigners or foreign governments .
