Hong Kong , the world 's busiest container port , is to build its first terminal designed to cater for China trade down the Pearl River Delta , writes Louise Lucas in Hong Kong . If the trade went to a port in China it could cost the colony more than HKDollars 13bn ( Pounds 1.1bn ) over 10 years , according to government estimates . The newest terminal will be part of an overall port project which aims to put in place up to 24 new container berths by the year 2011 . It will handle the growing volume of cargo that comes down river from China - often bundled up in sacks , and nearly always requiring containerisation - which is expected to double by 2001 and quadruple in the following decade . There were 20.7m tonnes of freight carried by river last year , and the Port Development Board reckons existing facilities will reach full capacity by 1996 . The River Trade Terminal will be built and operated by private enterprise and the first phase should be completed by late 1997 . The project is expected to go out to tender this year .
