The New Zealand economy is set to show sustainable growth over the next two years without suffering from inflationary pressure or a widening current account deficit , said Mr Don Brash , Reserve Bank governor , writes Terry Hall in Wellington . Mr Brash is charged with setting interest rate and exchange rate policies with the aim of ensuring inflation does not rise above 2 per cent . He said that , following gross domestic product growth in excess of 5 per cent last year , the bank was projecting GDP to rise by 4.4 per cent during the current year and by 3.1 per cent in 1996 . The projected slowing of the growth rate was primarily due to cyclical influences on consumption and investment , Mr Brash told a news conference . Forecasts showed that underlying inflation would rise moderately , helped by an expected increase in exchange and interest rates over the next three years . New Zealand would benefit from continued strong exports , consumption growth would moderate , fiscal surpluses would increase strongly , and there would be strong growth in employment .
