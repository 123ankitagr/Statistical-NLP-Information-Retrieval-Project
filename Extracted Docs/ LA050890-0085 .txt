Columbia Savings & Loan , the troubled Beverly Hills thrift that lost $ 591.1 million last year and is now insolvent , paid its top executives $ 4 million in bonuses last year , according to public documents filed Monday . The information on the 17 current or former top Columbia executives -- who received a total of $ 9.5 million in compensation , including the bonuses -- is contained in the thrift 's annual proxy statement filed with the federal Office of Thrift Supervision . The disclosure could prove sticky for Columbia executives , who are scrambling to save the thrift from a federal takeover amid a huge drop in the value of its risky junk bond portfolio . Indeed , many of the executives receiving the largest bonuses have left the firm within the past six months . Columbia executives declined comment . Separately , former Columbia Savings Chairman and Chief Executive Thomas Spiegel , the savings and loan industry 's top-paid executive in 1985 when he earned $ 9 million , will earn $ 1 this year as a consultant in trying to help Columbia find a buyer for its junk bonds , the proxy statement says . Spiegel was to have earned $ 500,000 , the document shows , but thrift regulators objected to it . The proxy also discloses for the first time that Spiegel returned to Columbia last November $ 600,000 that he had received as part of his $ 4.1-million pay package in 1988 after regulators made it known they believed his compensation was excessive . The single largest amount paid by Columbia in 1989 went to Christopher S. Moore , an executive vice president in corporate finance who resigned two months ago . He received $ 1.35 million , including a $ 1.15-million bonus . Moore 's job was to arrange financing deals for Columbia , a task that was effectively eliminated by last year 's federal thrift reform laws . Lawrence K. Fish , who resigned as president in August and now heads troubled Bank of New England , was second with $ 1.32 million , including an $ 820,000 lump sum he received when he resigned . Former chief Spiegel earned $ 898,922 in salary and other compensation before resigning on Dec. 31 . Columbia , whose largest shareholders are Spiegel and members of his family , suffered huge losses last year as the market for high-yield , high-risk junk bonds plunged . The thrift now is in danger of being seized by regulators . On Friday , Columbia disclosed that it lost an additional $ 293.3 million in the first quarter . The thrift now has a negative net worth of $ 215.6 million and is $ 338.3 million short of the money it needs to meet the government 's most basic requirement of capital , which is the financial buffer it must maintain to protect against losses . Spiegel 's 1989 compensation included $ 750,000 in salary and $ 148,922 in other compensation , specified as tax accounting fees , use of an automobile , use of a corporate jet and a `` transfer of certain art objects at appraised value . '' The amount , the proxy statement says , does not include $ 140,331 for life insurance premiums . Spiegel did not receive a bonus . The proxy statement does show that although Spiegel earns only $ 1 a year from Columbia now , he does receive $ 17,400 a month in office and other expenses as he works to help the S & L divest its junk bonds . Still , what Spiegel received is dwarfed by what he earned in previous years . His $ 9 million earned in 1985 , which included $ 5 million deferred to a special retirement fund , shook the S & L business . Regulators objected , but later dropped their protest . He received packages worth $ 4.38 million in 1986 and $ 5.46 million in 1987 . According to the proxy statement , Edward G. Harshfield , hired in March to replace Spiegel and try to save Columbia , will earn no less than $ 500,000 a year under his three-year agreement , but may earn more than $ 3 million in other bonuses , depending on his performance . The proxy statement also says that Harshfield is being allowed to continue as general partner of a Merrill Lynch-sponsored investment fund that he was affiliated with when hired by Columbia . Other top-paid Columbia executives included James A . D'Aquila , who resigned as chief financial officer in January . He earned $ 810,000 , including a $ 650,000 bonus . And Kenneth R. Heitz , Columbia 's top lawyer who filled in as interim chief executive earlier this year , earned $ 800,000 , including a $ 450,000 bonus . Columbia 's 83-year-old patriarch , Abraham Spiegel , Thomas Spiegel 's father , earned $ 500,000 in 1989 . The proxy statement says that his pay agreement was suspended effective May 1 until Columbia is solvent again .
