while us securities traders have been busy pushing longterm interest rates down to their lowest level in 15 years they have been keeping a cautious eye on the commodities markets sensitive to signals that president bill clintons economic plan may be stirring inflations embers inflation is toxic to bond prices driving up interest rates and increasing the cost of debt commodity prices have long been used as a proxy for inflation a practice lent legitimacy by the us federal reserve board which monitors price stability by watching a 21commodity index compiled by the new yorkbased commodity research bureau recent contradictions in the commodity pits have been enough to drive inflationwatchers to distraction palladium hit long time lows on monday while another industrial commodity lumber posted alltime highs grain prices have withered but meat prices which usually travel in tandem with feed prices are on the rise international commodities like sugar and oil have also rallied on the whole analysts say that there has been a steady but mild rise in several closelywatched commodity indices since late summer when it became apparent that mr clinton might clinch the presidency however since he took office in january the behaviour of the indices has diverged measures of industrial commodities and those heavily weighted toward energy are rising while more broadlybased indices are flat to date none of the inflationary measures have sounded an economic alarm were seeing some firmness in some commodities but not firmness in all commodities says mr samuel kahan chief economist at fuji securities a real economic pickup would bring firmness across the board he said the difference in behaviour of the commodities indices is explained by the differences in their composition economists looking for trends in us industrial production like to watch the journal of commerce index this follows the prices of 18 raw industrial commodities including copper and steel scrap burlap old corrugated boxes and crude oil the joc index rose to 1006 this week from 975 in early january the steady rally may signal a pickup in industrial production a natural introduction to an economic recovery however nearly 15 per cent of the indexs weighing is in lumber and lumber products largely domestic commodities whose rally in recent months has some analysts say skewed the index industrial production may indeed be picking up mr kahan says but so long as the pickup tracks economic growth it may not be inflationary the goldman sachs commodity index has also been on the rise since january reaching 186 this week from 181 the first week of the year the twomonth rally is significant says mr ravi bulchandani commodities analyst at goldman sachs but is only a small increase over january a year ago mr bulchandani attributes the indexs rise to firmer oil and meat prices the gsci is weighted by trade volume with nearly 50 per cent of its weight in energy or oil and another 24 per cent in livestock given the international characteristics of the index he attributes the gscis strength to the organisation of petroleum exporting countries recent agreement on production cuts and not to mr clintons economic plans the commodity research bureaus popular index of 21 commodity futures is virtually unchanged since january in part because each of its components carries equal weight a drop in the price of orange juice for example carries the same weight as a rally in oil the index is stuck around 203 up about five points from its august low mr sean mcnamara president of cig asset management a firm that advises investors on using commodity indices as a way to hedge against inflation and diversify portfolios calls the gsci an economically sound index but says the crb remains popular because it offers historical data extending back 40 years analysts say that while mr clintons economic plan is frontloaded with much of the economic stimulus expected to take effect quickly it can only hope to boost us demand as commodity trading spans the globe there is potential for a flood of foreign imports if us prices move higher this commodity traders say is already happening in the lumber market inflation fears are also tempered by excess capacity in the us in everything from aluminium smelting to grain production in the long run mr clintons policies are expected to have significant impact in individual commodities his energy tax aimed at deficit reduction will cut demand for oil and coal however to the extent that his energy taxes offend the uss opec trading partners they could also reduce worldwide oil production and raise energy costs slowing global recovery his emphasis on rebuilding the countrys infrastructure is bound to increase demand for industrial commodities like copper and steel analysts say however the presidents greater focus on the environment may raise costs to livestock producers and other agricultural enterprises limit expansion of mining and metals processing in the us and limit us timber production clean air provisions will further penalise energy producers on the trade side mr clinton has said he will be more strict in his dealings with china an important customer for us wheat he supports economic reform in the former soviet union but has not yet liberalised farm credits to russia allowing grain prices to languish on the other hand if mr clinton succeeds in implementing the north american free trade agreement us livestock producers are expected to benefit from broader export markets constituents of leading us
