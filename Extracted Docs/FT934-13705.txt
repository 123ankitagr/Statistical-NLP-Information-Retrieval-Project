european poultry producers are lining up behind french farmers calls for amendments to the blair house agreement which they say inadvertently penalises their business the blair house agreement which was agreed as part of uruguay round talks on the general agreement on tariffs and trade requires cuts in cereals subsidies of 21 per cent over 6 years it also means cuts in export refunds awarded to european community poultry producers when they export outside the community export refunds which at present amount to some 15 p a lb for fresh and frozen chickens are to compensate ec producers for the cost of buying grain for feed at high prices ec grain subsidies ensure that community prices are higher than the world market poultry producers do not receive direct income or production support from the government under the cap but we are having to pay prices way above the world market for feedstuffs said mr peter bradnock director-general of the british poultry meat federation the withdrawal of export refunds would affect around 40 per cent of the ec's 480,000 tonnes of exports outside the community it would make it extremely difficult for producers to compete in many markets overseas since high feed costs account for almost 60 per cent of their production costs europe's main poultry producers in france the uk and italy have agreed to lobby their national governments on the issue uk poultry producers are to meet mrs gillian shephard agriculture minister today to discuss the export business we'd like a mechanism where we could obtain supplies of feedstuffs at world prices for our export stock said mr bradnock the industry also wants the export refunds to be reduced more gradually over the 6 year period
