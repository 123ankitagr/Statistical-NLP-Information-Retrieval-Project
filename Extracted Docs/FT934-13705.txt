EUROPEAN POULTRY producers are lining up behind French farmers ' calls for amendments to the Blair House agreement which they say inadvertently penalises their business . The Blair House agreement , which was agreed as part of Uruguay Round talks on the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade , requires cuts in cereals subsidies of 21 per cent over 6 years . It also means cuts in export refunds awarded to European Community poultry producers when they export outside the community . Export refunds , which at present amount to some 15p a lb for fresh and frozen chickens , are to compensate EC producers for the cost of buying grain for feed at high prices . EC grain subsidies ensure that community prices are higher than the world market . 'Poultry producers do not receive direct income or production support from the government under the CAP , but we are having to pay prices way above the world market for feedstuffs , ' said Mr Peter Bradnock , director-general of the British Poultry Meat Federation . The withdrawal of export refunds would affect around 40 per cent of the EC's 480,000 tonnes of exports outside the community . It would make it extremely difficult for producers to compete in many markets overseas since high feed costs account for almost 60 per cent of their production costs . Europe 's main poultry producers in France , the UK and Italy have agreed to lobby their national governments on the issue . UK poultry producers are to meet Mrs Gillian Shephard , agriculture minister , today to discuss the export business . 'We 'd like a mechanism where we could obtain supplies of feedstuffs at world prices for our export stock , ' said Mr Bradnock . The industry also wants the export refunds to be reduced more gradually over the 6 year period .
