COLOR LINE , the Norwegian ferry operator , unveiled record pre-tax profits of NKr132m ( Dollars 22.9m ) for the first eight months of this year . This compares with a NKr2m loss in the same period last year . The return to profit stemmed largely from a marked increase in the volume of traffic in most of its ferry routes . Color Line said there had been an especially strong increase in traffic on its Bergen/Stavanger-Newcastle line . Net operating income in the period rose to NKr1.07bn from NKr978m last year . Mr Jon Erik Nygaard , managing director , forecast a small increase in profits for the year as a whole , and said the company was considering refinancing long-term debt of NKr1.5bn . He forecast annual market growth of 6 per cent to 7 per cent , slightly lower than recent years .
