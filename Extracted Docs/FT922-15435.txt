the evidence that electro-magnetic fields generated by electrical appliances and overhead power lines can cause cancer is inconclusive according to a comprehensive review released yesterday by the national radiological protection board the nrpb is to sponsor more research into the health effects of non-ionising radiation to which everyone living in an industrialised country is exposed through the use of electricity at home and at work the data available so far do not appear to provide the basis for restricting human exposure to non-ionising electromagnetic radiation said mr roger clarke nrpb director an nrpb committee chaired by sir richard doll of the imperial cancer research fund carried out the review mr clarke called it the biggest study published anywhere in the world on cancer and electromagnetic fields the subject is controversial because some environmental groups particularly in the us are convinced that electro-magnetic fields can damage health they have used the alleged cancer risk to campaign against overhead power lines and some cancer patients living close to power lines are now suing electric utilities a report by the us environmental protection agency in 1990 concluded that there was a statistical link between exposure to electromagnetic radiation and human cancer but the agency's report was withdrawn before publication because other federal bodies were not happy with it sir richard said in london yesterday that the agency's draft report was so inadequate in so many ways that it could not be adopted the nrpb report reviews more than 60 studies of occupational cancer in electrical workers and eight studies of childhood cancer leukaemia and brain cancer are the two diseases most likely to be associated with electromagnetic fields i am confident that there is no occupational hazard of leukaemia sir richard said there was more chance though no clear evidence that a small excess of brain cancer among electrical workers might be due to electromagnetic radiation professor nicholas grant of king's college london another member of the nrpb committee said the evidence for childhood cancer was weak he added that exposure to electromagnetic fields at home might increase the cancer risk by as much as 50 per cent to 100 per cent equivalent to one extra case per 1,500 children or there might be no extra risk additional research will be carried out in three areas there will be a large-scale study of childhood cancer occupational studies and laboratory experiments with animals and cells to test the theory that electromagnetic fields can promote tumours electromagnetic field and the risk of cancer hmso pounds 10
