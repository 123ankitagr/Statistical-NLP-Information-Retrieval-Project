It sounds as if some of Argentina 's overseas ambassadors may be an even worse credit risk than the country they have been chosen to represent . Buenos Aires ' newspapers have been filled with reports that some of Argentina 's departing ambassadors have left behind hundreds of thousands of dollars in unpaid debts . Admittedly , part of the explanation has to do with confusion over ambassadors ' private and official expenses . Even so , the list of ambassadorial debtors has set tongues wagging . Ambassador Carlos Mandry , former ambassador to Bonn , is alleged to have left Deutsche Bank with a Dollars 300,000 overdraft after he was recalled last year . Ruben Cardozo left Paraguay and Dollars 230,000 in IOUs and the former ambassador to The Hague , Julian William Kent , owed banks Dollars 100,000 . The Foreign Ministry is investigating but says that 'where spending was for official functions , the debts were checked and paid by the ministry . But in the case of personal debts , that 's each ambassador 's problem . ' Or , rather , each ambassador 's creditor 's problem .
