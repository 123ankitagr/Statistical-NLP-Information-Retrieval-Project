it is rare for a day to pass without mention of the internet what is it the easiest way to think of the internet is as an international telephone system for computers a system of more than 7500 individual computer networks the internet connects more than 2m computers and 25m people just as the international telephone system makes possible conversations between individuals anywhere on the planet so the internet makes it possible for computers to exchange messages and information why has it suddenly sprung to prominence this is a consequence of the spread of lowcost powerful computers the internet grew out of a 1969 us department of defence project arpanet designed to link international research teams the scientists used the network to disseminate messages and information and the us government sponsored its extension to colleges and universities today the national research and education network funded by the national science foundation is the backbone of the internet in the us computer hobbyists were the first outside the academic community to discover the benefits of the internet as more companies and individuals gain access to computers and modems the equivalent of a telephone handset for a computer its popularity has soared usage is said to be growing at 10 per cent a month what are these benefits there are three ability to send electronic messages to individuals or groups the capacity to send large volumes of data rapidly around the globe this is a spinoff from the internets role as a tool for scientists and access to vast amounts of information held on computer databases among other things the complete scripts of rowan atkinsons black adder television programmes without doubt the chief use of the internet is as a vehicle for electronic mail one us corporation exchanges almost 2m internet messages with people outside the company every month what are the disadvantages power is one you need a fast computer with plenty of memory to make the best use of the internet another is navigating the system finding what you want from the bewildering variety of information on offer can be expensive and timeconsuming indices and search tools are becoming available but they are in early development and because the internet developed in an ad hoc way there is no central ownership or authority management is in the hands of the users or at least those users who feel they can contribute to the internet engineering planning group a little daunting for computing tyros how do i get on to the internet internet users are often connected through their colleges or companies otherwise you will need to employ an internet service provider isp which will for a fee arrange access to the net in britain examples include pipex cityscape and demon internet services in france oleane germany xlink and maz italy itnet sweden switnet in britain the bbc has contracted with pipex to provide lowcost access as a feature of its programme the net what will i need to join and what will it cost me basically a powerful personal computer equipped with a modem after that it depends of the level of service but typically in britain it will cost an individual between pounds 1250 and pounds 50 for the software together with a monthly fee of pounds 10 or pounds 15 you will also have to pay the cost of the local telephone call to your service provider while you are connected to the network in addition you may have to pay at business rates for information drawn from commercial databases you will be registered as an internet subscriber with a unique address of your choosing so long as it follows the internet format name short address type of organisation and country for example alan cane ft co uk it sounds a little anarchic can businesses use it with confidence in the past few years companies have begun to use the internet on a wide scale perhaps 60 per cent of the traffic on the net is now commercial in origin it has become the information highway of the 1990s what about stories of security failures the internet is selfpolicing which means that breaches quickly become public knowledge nevertheless the network was not built with security as a priority the intention was to encourage use rather than keep people out the isps can build a firewall a secure computer between the internet and a companys own computer systems to prevent hacking and intrusion while individuals can encrypt their messages using facilities in their wordprocessing software who if anybody is making money out of the internet companies such as cisco welfleet and synoptics which build the switches and routers to manage the networks are making good profits the isps and informationproviders are still in the investment phase the network is after all only three years old as a vehicle for commercial traffic and the future peter dawe of pipex draws an analogy between a roman road and a modern motorway the internet will remain the principal medium for computer interconnection even if it changes out of all recognition in the process
