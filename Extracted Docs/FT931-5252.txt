redundancy is affecting more and more people with a growing number of the nations 3m unemployed being former executives and while it might seem calamitous financially it is one of the better ways to leave a job resigning or taking early retirement mean losing out on many benefits before redundancy if you suspect you might be made redundant there are several measures you can take in advance peter smith of financial adviser hill martin which specialises in retirement and redundancy planning says people think they have no negotiating power that is not quite right when an employer is making someone redundant they want them out of the door as soon as possible and sometimes they say yes to something just to get rid of them start by taking out your contract of employment and check the terms and conditions particularly the length of notice to which you are entitled you will then be able to ensure that payoff terms agree with the contract if you belong to a union trade or professional body see if it has any guidelines or advice jenny woolf author of redundancy coping and bouncing back suggests taking full advantage of facilities offered by the company while you are still employed such as a medical checkup if you have redundancy cover for mortgage payments check its terms and conditions these protection plans are becoming increasingly expensive while offering poorer value see page vi redundancy negotiations statutory redundancy pay is the legal minimum which an employer is obliged to pay and it is calculated on your age and length of service subject to the current maximum of pounds 205 a week you qualify for statutory redundancy payments only if you have been in fulltime work for two years or in parttime work for five but many employers offer an exgratia payment as long as your total redundancy pay does not exceed pounds 30000 and is not made as part of your conditions of service it is taxfree anything over pounds 30000 will be taxed under the payasyouearn system which can mean toprate tax of 40 per cent on the excess it can therefore be to your advantage particularly if you are over 50 to ask your employer to make part of the payment into your pension scheme hill martins smith says this has to be done before you leave and harold roberts of towry law a financial adviser which has produced a free guide to redundancy warns that care must be taken not to exceed inland revenue limits remember that you are likely to be entitled to a tax rebate for the year in which you were made redundant since you will be taxed on the assumption that you were working for the full tax year if however your termination date is near the end of the tax year smith suggests asking your employer if it could fall into the next one your income for the new financial year is likely to be lower than the previous year so you could be taxed at the lower rate on any excess over pounds 30000 smith also says that if you have ever worked overseas for your employer extra tax exemption could apply you should seek professional advice in this complicated area you might be asked to accept pay in lieu of notice which would have the added benefit of being taxfree but woolf warns that if you have redundancy insurance it might not pay out until the termination date the same is usually true of state benefits make sure your employer pays for holiday entitlements which you have not taken and ask him to allow you to go for job interviews during paid hours look at the perks which the company gives you and see if any can be extended life assurance and medical insurance cease when you leave employment but roberts says some employers may be prepared to maintain policies for up to six months after redundancy smith advises asking if the company carries a continuation option without requiring a further health check try to see if you can continue medical expenses insurance at a discount and without having to declare existing health defects trying to keep hold of the company car could be more difficult because of its insurance many companies provide the company car for the period of notice or provide a hire car at their expense said roberts some employers will pay for financial counselling and outplacement services but if not ask for it finally get your employer to put your redundancy terms down on paper once you leave unemployment benefit if you have been a wellpaid professional you will probably feel uncomfortable signing on but as long as you have paid the required national insurance contributions and are seeking work actively it is yours by right one advantage even if the present rate of pounds 4310 a week for those under 65 plus pounds 2555 for adult dependents is not too attractive is that nics will be credited to you automatically so you will not lose your state retirement entitlement roger taylor of the consumers association warns not to expect unemployment benefit immediately your entitlement will be affected by statutory redundancy payments wages due holiday pay refund of pension scheme contributions and payments due from your employer before you were made redundant he says any payments above and beyond these are treated as payments in lieu work out how many weeks pay this is equivalent to you will not be able to claim unemployment benefit until this time is up claims can not usually be backdated which is another reason for signing on as soon as possible the benefit lasts for one year if you have health problems smith advises signing on for sickness benefit instead since it is nontaxable and payable as long as you are ill you might qualify for income support to help with mortgage interest payments ground rent and other housing costs if your total capital is less than pounds 8000 including capital held abroad but if you have been made redundant recently you will probably have too much capital if you dispose of the capital you will not be entitled to benefit if the dss considers you deliberately got rid of the capital to qualify for income support says taylor paying off your mortgage might also count as getting rid of capital you should also tell your local authority as you could be entitled to a lower community charge roberts says that if your children are in higher education the local authority grant will be reviewed finally if you have a mortgage contact your building society and your bank manager to let them know what has happened many building societies have special schemes to help the unemployed and the same applies to your bank says roberts redundancy coping and bouncing back by
