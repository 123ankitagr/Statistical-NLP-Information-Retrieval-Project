the poor state of the uk housing market is dragging on into a sensitive period for uk building societies raising doubts about profitability and credit quality as they look to refinance a substantial part of their pounds 20bn capital market borrowings in total uk building societies have pounds 26bn bonds and syndicated loans maturing this year rising to pounds 45bn in 1993 and pounds 34bn in 1994 one thing is certain banks and bond market investors are demanding much higher returns than in the late 1980s when building societies were first allowed to tap the capital markets in 1987 for example halifax the largest building society signed a fiveyear pounds 300m multicurrency facility which gave it access to sterling funding at just 005 per cent 5 basis points over the london interbank offered rate libor the facility runs out in july and halifax would have to pay at least 30 basis points over libor to replace it with a similar loan during the late 1980s building societies faced a declining inflow of savings from retail depositors and increasing demand for housing finance to meet this shortfall they expanded capital markets borrowings to more than 20 per cent of total funding in many cases while demand for new mortgages has fallen sharply there is little prospect of replacing capital markets debts with retail deposits despite the severity of the recession building societies saw a net outflow of funds in november and december bankers are taking a cautious approach at the end of last year chelsea building society had to improve the terms of a planned pounds 125m loan to attract wary banks into the deal with this in mind the bigger building societies are looking to tap other sources of funding such as the bond and mediumterm note markets where better terms are available the bigger societies now have access to a greater variety of wholesale markets and so have less need for standby banking facilities last june for example halifax building society set up a pounds 3bn mediumterm note programme since our loans were arranged in the late 1980s our wholesale funding base has matured and the need for syndicated credits is less apparent said mr mike ellis treasurer of the halifax we can now afford to be more selective in our use of markets but even in the bond markets there is upward pressure on margins new types of instrument will have to be used if funding costs are to be held down around 40 to 50 per cent of sterling floatingrate note issues the favoured form of bond market borrowing for building societies in the late 1980s are held by banks these are usually the same banks which lent money to building societies through syndicated credits bought mortgagebacked bonds and sometimes lent money directly to uk consumers for house purchases as the property market has slumped these banks have exercised a sharp pullback from new housingrelated exposures there are fewer willing buyers of building society bonds hence increased borrowing costs do not only reflect a decline in the perceived credit quality of building societies the level of funding that the building societies are seeking is more than the banks are willing to give said ms zoe shaw director at westdeutsche landesbank the german bank which is an active lender to the building society sector while the bigger societies still remain measured against most other financial institutions strong and tightly regulated there is little doubt the credit quality of building societies looks under pressure there have already been some forced takeovers at the end of last year town country the 15th largest institution was rescued by the woolwich there is intense speculation that other building societies will have to be bailed out although the rate of residential mortgage defaults looks to be slowing up to 80000 homes will be repossessed this year the rate of repossessions means building societies could be left managing large vacant residential property portfolios partly to avoid this and partly to satisfy political pressure building societies have pledged to provide pounds 1bn this year to alleviate the crisis most of the money will be made available in the form of cheap loans to housing associations which will in turn buy properties in danger of repossession and then rent them if the housing associations are to charge affordable rents the loans have to be made at very low interest rates as low as 35 per cent in london where property prices are highest yet the cost of funds to building societies whether from the capital markets or from depositors is 10 per cent or more hence funding mortgage rescue loans will eat into building societies profits for some years to come the societies hope to recoup losses by taking an equity interest in the properties if homes become vacant after five years assuming property prices have gone up the housing association will have to sell on the open market the building society will take 80 per cent of any capital gain hence the net cost to the building societies will depend on when properties become vacant whether property prices have risen and the cost of funding cheap loans to housing associations in the intervening period
