EVEN third best is not bad when it is a diamond weighing 273 carats . Mr Gabi Tolkowsky ( above ) was in charge of cutting the De Beers Centenary diamond , which was unveiled yesterday at the Tower of London . It is third in size only to the Great Star of Africa and the Lesser Star of Africa , both in the Crown Jewels . It has taken three years to cut the diamond , insured for Dollars 100m ( Pounds 58m ) , from a 599-carat rough stone taken from the Premier Mine in South Africa in 1986 .
