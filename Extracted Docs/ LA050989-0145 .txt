having toiled in the rock biz since the heyday of the lowermanhattan music scene 13 years ago and having weathered a messy divorce messier managerial problems and a long battle with drugs theres no question that willy deville is a soul survivor what hasnt survived is the soul at the coach house in san juan capistrano sunday night backed by a new mink deville band with no familiar faces he was still singing about the aching sadness of failed love and thanks to his vocal gifts you could still feel the ache but these days he casts his tales as airy ballads or remarkably feisty rock romps the rb especially the swaggering soul around which he built his career is pretty much gone this is not bad nor is it very surprising two years ago when he dissolved mink deville and recorded the solo album miracle produced and featuring guitarplaying by dire straits maestro mark knopfler his intention was to get away from the stylized mink deville sound he felt that he had painted himself into a corner with the rb and soul orientation the smoky sax and other musical elements with his presentation at the coach house he was merely staying true to his new musical direction and it worked enormously well he still managed to hurl a few curve balls though both sonic and visual cruising on stage as the band lit into a fairly hoppin boppin take on lillys daddys cadillac rail thin occasionally flashing a gold tooth from his reptilian face he was decked out in some kind of matador jacket leather pants boots hoop earrings and poofy black pompadour we arent exactly talking gq material here but we are talking one of the coolest guys in rock and an eminently engaging performer deville smoking a cigarette is more interesting than most rockers going through their onstage gyrations more importantly cleareyed and in fine voice willy delivered the goods whether performing tunes from miracle such as heart and soul an atmospheric piece with a latin lilt over which he sang a naked pledge of undying love and devotion or rearranged versions of early classics willy was on top of his game investing every word with seemingly heartfelt emotion he still comes across as a romantic whos not only incurable but absolutely not interested in being cured he also injected many of the numbers with some stinging guitar licks on an initially unrecognizable rendition of moon martins cadillac walk much bigger denser and more booming than mink devilles recorded version he cut loose with some wailing slide guitar it was that kind of night full of surprises mostly pleasant ones to those who openly pine for the mink deville sound and style of yesteryear willy would probably lean forward flash a goldtoothed grin and say tough wed have to agree
