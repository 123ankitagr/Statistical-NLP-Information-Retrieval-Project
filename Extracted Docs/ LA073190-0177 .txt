baseball didn't take george steinbrenner's team away from him monday it did something more necessary it took away his forum for too many years the boss had made the new york yankees his personal podium almost single-handedly keeping tabloids in the banner-headline business long before he paid howard spira 40,000, steinbrenner had lost touch with the best interests of baseball let alone those of the yankees agreeing not to take commissioner fay vincent's decision to reduce him to a minority shareholder to court might have been the only thing steinbrenner has done for baseball in a decade and then it came because lawyers advised him he would lose if pete rose ably represented the tragedy of greed steinbrenner embodied the ugliest side of wealth for years he hired and fired at whim belittled employees while turning baseball's proudest franchise into a personal toy vincent will allow steinbrenner to keep a piece of his team turn his profits and enjoy the american system of free enterprise from now on however the boss won't be and will need permission from baseball to so much as attend games through his actions vincent has sent a message that there are limits to the indignities baseball will accept now and for as long as it is played baseball must come first under steinbrenner the yankees had ceased being new york's team and became george's team when they lost he vilified them sent them to the minors insulted them in print ordered tickets withheld from certain players wives when fans began chanting an anti-steinbrenner slogan in yankee stadium in the early 80 s steinbrenner told the new york post they can say anything they want i've got their money in my back pocket for nearly two decades he feuded with the biggest names in baseball reggie jackson dave winfield ron guidry dave righetti rickey henderson don mattingly he didn't merely fire good baseball men all owners do that he tried to break them he broke his word and the rules frequently in steinbrenner's world success was measured by 500-million cable-television contracts and having his quotes played above new york mets games on the sports pages money was power until vincent pulled the plug monday finally baseball stood up to its resident bully in the days and weeks to come steinbrenner will play the martyr telling anyone who listens that he accepted vincent's punishment quietly rather than drag baseball into courts where he will argue he most certainly would have won it doesn't matter the man newsweek magazine put on its cover this week as the most hated man in baseball has been told to go stand in a corner by the father figure of the game and beginning this morning new york will have two baseball teams again the game is better for it
