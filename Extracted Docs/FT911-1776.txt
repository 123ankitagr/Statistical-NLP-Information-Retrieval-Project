ISRAELI researchers , in experiments on mice , have isolated a peptide which can prevent the onset of diabetes and which might provide the basis for an early diagnostic test and vaccine against the illness in humans . In auto - immune diseases the immune system 's 'T ' cells , which are supposed to fight disease , attack the body 's own cells when they recognise a particular peptide ( a segment of protein ) . In the case of diabetes these are the insulin-producing cells of the pancreas . Researchers at the Weizmann Institute , in Rehovot , have found that by isolating the appropriate peptide , and by giving extra doses of it to the mice , the autoimmune attack could be aborted . The peptide is synthesised from a protein which is present in human beings . Weizmann Institute : Israel , 08 343512 .
