AN INDUSTRIAL tribunal claim by Miss Alison Halford , an assistant chief constable in the Merseyside police , against sexual discrimination is likely to go ahead today in spite of an attempt to postpone it . Lawyers for Mr James Sharples , Merseyside chief constable , had applied for an adjournment so that an appeal over admissibility of evidence could be heard in 10 days . Mr Eldred Tabachnik QC , for Miss Halford , described the adjournment request as 'intolerable and indeed cruel ' . He added : 'We are very concerned that the chief constable is seeking to stall these proceedings and that he is exploiting every possible legal opportunity in order to delay the hearing . ' Miss Halford has alleged that in nine applications for deputy chief constable posts she was shortlisted only twice and offered none .
