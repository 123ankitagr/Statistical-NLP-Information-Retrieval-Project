the rev john huffman reached for a worn bible in his booklined study it was a gift he said a gesture of graciousness from a man in the midst of a glorious but doomed career the inscription says that huffman as a messenger of gods word strengthened each of us in the work of peace and human justice it was signed richard nixon now pastor of the 4000member st andrews presbyterian church in newport beach huffman wrestles with the days political issues like abortion and homosexuality but hes no stranger to the moral hot seat from 196873 the years dominated by the war in vietnam and the watergate scandal he was the confidante of a besieged president though huffman 50 has been pastor of st andrews for 11 years he said few members of his congregation are aware of his past he has rarely been asked about nixon since the turmoil of the final days he said in an unusual interview he granted recently he stressed he could not as a pastor reveal any confidences made by nixon at that time but he did talk about his feelings toward nixon and some of the drama surrounding that turbulent era he recalled that nixon reared an evangelical quaker rarely attended church services in washington he lived with the fear that the same thing would happen to him that happened to lyndon johnson that he would go to church and be attacked from the pulpit but when nixon vacationed in florida he and his family attended services at huffmans presbyterian church in key biscayne fla which was recommended to nixon by his friend bebe rebozo a regular churchgoer nixon came to church on easters after his inauguration and following his trips to china and the soviet union when he came the services drew about 80 reporters and were usually picketed by war protesters one called huffman a pig and threatened him with an ice pick he said at the time news analysts called huffman who had his own radio and television shows flamboyant and handsome and not particularly modest they noted that huffmans rise in prominence paralleled his association with the president photographs of the two show dark wavyhaired men who could be brothers after nixon came to his church he was indeed offered his own television ministry but turned it down he said i predicted then the tv ministries would get tripped up by finances huffman who once aspired to politics as a christian witness said nixon appreciated his worldly views as well as his sinandrepentance style of preaching at nixons request huffman preached at the white house and held a special televised service at key biscayne to mark the cease fire in the vietnam war he said the day before the united states invaded cambodia nixon shared intelligence information with huffman over breakfast i talked with him behind the scenes about his political problems huffman said after the easter sunday service in 1973 amid increasing revelations about the watergate scandal huffman said he walked nixon to his car and asked him directly whether he knew anything about the 1972 breakin at the democratic national committee offices nixon assured me i knew nothing about it i can picture his eyes they were intent while huffman believed him that day heralded the beginning of a long estrangement of the two huffmans sermon that day used a biblical allusion the king knoweth of these things this thing was not done in a corner it was widely interpreted by the media as criticism of nixons involvement in the coverup and a call for him to repent huffman said the sermon was written before he knew nixon would attend and was not directed at him but he learned through the white house people that eventually nixon suspected the worst that he had been attacked from the pulpit later the publication of secretly taped conversations between nixon and his aides revealed him to be active in the watergate coverup a key biscayne news account that included huffmans reaction carried the headline nixon lied to me former minister says that day he said the husband of a church member spat in his face and called him traitor although he had moved by that time to be pastor of a church in pittsburgh huffman said i received hundreds of letters across the country castigating me for attacking the greatest president this country ever had it would break my heart if i would ever say anything unkind to him at the same time the record has to stand as it is he was one of the most complex in my view brilliant presidents and he has a sinister side to him he certainly dealt with fear or whatever in terms of the kennedys but he would say to this day that he was loyal to john mitchell and loyalty was one of his highest priorities others would say how come white house aides hr haldeman and john d ehrlichman are in jail as for himself huffman said i love richard nixon he used the word gracious repeatedly to characterize nixon then and now huffman said he and nixon have become friends again he said he wrote the pardoned president several years ago praising his speeches on international relations and saying he regretted the parting of their paths in 1973 i said i was honestly trying to express my viewpoints on things and i loved him like my own father he wrote back very graciously saying lets let bygones by bygones life is too short to carry feelings too long and he sent me his book on leaders which is very graciously inscribed this one reads to john huffman with best wishes nixon in china the former president is visiting at a time when sinous relations are strained a4
