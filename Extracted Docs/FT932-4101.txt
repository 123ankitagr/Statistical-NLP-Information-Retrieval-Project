science today feeds the hollywood hype machine the last morsel it needs to promote steven spielberg's latest film on the eve of jurassic park opening in the us a research team has announced that it has extracted the first samples of genetic material from the dinosaur era the researchers include dr george pionar of the university of california berkeley who was a scientific adviser to the heavily promoted jurassic park its plot is based on the use of genetic engineering to re-create dinosaurs starting from the dna in blood sucked by mosquitoes that were then preserved in amber for more than 100 m years the pionar group has isolated insect dna from a weevil trapped 120 m years ago in lebanese amber it is 80 m years older than any dna extracted previously from amber fossilised tree resin that has a unique capacity to preserve organic material and is the first from an animal alive when dinosaurs roamed the earth such a discovery would have seemed like science fiction be-fore researchers started studying ancient genes in the mid-1980s it depends on gene-amplifying technology called polymerase chain reaction which enables scientists to make billions of copies of any piece of dna the californian scientists obtained enough dna to carry out a genetic comparison with present-day weevils but it represents less than one-millionth of the ancient creature's total genetic complement all of which would be needed to resurrect the extinct species nature the uk journal which publishes the californian dna research in today's issue insists that its release a day before the film is pure coincidence merchandising monster page 9
