State transportation officials are asking commuters who use California 118 between Simi Valley and Moorpark to be patient the next several weeks as workers repave a section of the road . The $ 400,000 improvement project , which began last week , covers a half-mile section between Alamos Canyon Road and the Simi Valley Landfill , Caltrans engineer Robert Joe said . Moisture in the soil under the roadway has caused the pavement to bow and crack , Joe said . Only one lane of the four-lane highway will be closed at a time during the construction period , Joe said . The work is scheduled to be completed by Aug. 24 . CARLOS V. LOZANO
