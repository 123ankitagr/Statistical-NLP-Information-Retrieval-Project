Conservationists have made their largest single debt-for-nature swap , buying $ 5.6 million in discounted debt for $ 784,000 to help protect over 355,000 acres in Costa Rica , an environmental group said Wednesday . The Nature Conservancy , an international land conservation group , said it purchased the debt from American Express Bank in the fifth debt-for-nature transaction and the one with the largest face value so far . `` The over $ 3 million generated by the debt swap transaction will fund park protection , conservation training , educational programs , biological inventories and land acquisitions variously at nine conservation projects throughout the country , '' the group said . The debt will be converted to Costa Rican currency bonds valued at $ 1.7 million . The bonds , paying an average yearly interest of 25 % over five years , are expected to generate more than $ 3 million , the Nature Conservancy said . The World Wildlife Fund made the previous biggest swap , valued at $ 5.4 million in March , 1988 , also in Costa Rica . Costa Rica is experiencing the highest deforestation rate , outside of its parks , of any country in the Western Hemisphere . The project was initiated by the Costa Rican National Parks Foundation , a private organization , and authorized by the Costa Rican Natural Resources Ministry and the Central Bank .
