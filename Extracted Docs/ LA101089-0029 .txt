Mega-star Michael Jackson will be given a commemorative plaque by his sixth-grade teacher , Laura Gerson , on Wednesday during dedication ceremonies for the newly refurbished auditorium that will bear his name at Gardner Street Elementary School in Hollywood . Jackson attended sixth grade at the school in 1969-70 . Principal Jeff Sweeney says the tribute to Jackson was the brainchild of a group of Gardner parents who helped spearhead an extensive , three-year renovation project of the school 's main building , where the auditorium is located .
