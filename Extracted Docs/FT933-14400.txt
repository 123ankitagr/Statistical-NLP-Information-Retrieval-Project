bond traders who use commodity prices to predict inflation-rate changes have had to pick their indicators carefully this year industrial commodity prices have for the most part fallen while futures prices for consumer goods such as cereals gold and softs have tended to rise at the same time us government indices that measure price movements have exhibited a curious tendency to follow seasonal variations a trend belies the bureau of labour statistics practice of adjusting prices for seasonal factors if as forecast the bls reports today that consumer prices were flat in june it will bring the consumer price index cpi back to a year-over-year rate close to 3 per cent little changed from last year that is good news for businesses and the us federal reserve board which aim for price stability however it is a puzzle to fixed-income traders who shorted bonds when inflation took an alarming swing upwards in the first quarter mr john lipsky chief economist for salomon brothers says cpi data have risen in the first four months of every year since 1989, without consistently following through for the rest of the year the june cpi if it comes in on forecast will smooth the first quarter's seasonal changes for now outlook for energy prices is good demand is not too strong and the dollar is helpings us out overseas that gives a pretty steady outlook for inflation mr lipsky said the calm inflation forecast seems to be borne out by commodity prices while the commodity research bureau's closely watched index of futures prices reached 20-month highs last week it did so on the strength of soyabean and precious metals prices those commodities carry very little weight in either the cpi or the producer price index a better indicator of price inflation is the crb's index of spot industrial commodities heavily weighted towards scrap metals and materials like rubber and tin that index in contrast to the futures index is near its lowest levels of the year a third the goldman sachs commodity index is in a similar position the two indices are moving in parallel because industrial metals and energy prices have been locked together this year economists say it will take an upward turn in the broader indexes to predict a shift in inflation expectations
