Federal investigators extended their search of the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons facility for 10 days longer and established a special telephone line to receive scores of tips flooding in from whistle-blowers , angry neighbors and other concerned citizens , the FBI said Wednesday . The search warrant was being renewed because `` the size and number of documents involved make this a very voluminous , monstrous operation , '' Bob Pence , special agent-in-charge of the FBI in Colorado , said . Additional agents from both the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency have been brought in `` from around the country '' to help look for evidence of environmental crimes allegedly committed at the plant 16 miles northwest of Denver . Pence said the Department of Energy and its Rocky Flats contractor , Rockwell International Corp. , were cooperating in the investigation . Both the Energy Department and Rockwell are suspected of illegal dumping , burning of hazardous wastes and falsifying documents . Agents in special protective clothing have been posted around the clock at the plant , which manufactures plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons , since a massive raid was mounted there nine days ago . Pence said that the FBI and the Environmental Protection Agency have received well over 100 calls from people offering new information about suspected wrongdoing at the plant , Pence said . `` Some of it seems to be pretty significant , '' he said , but he would not discuss any of the tips in detail .
