A FOUR-MEMBER Taiwanese delegation left for China yesterday to pave the way for a ground-breaking meeting between representatives of both sides , Reuter reports from Taiwan . The delegation from Taiwan 's Straits Exchange Foundation , a semi-official body which handles ties with China , will make preparations for a trip to Beijing by SEF secretary-general Cheyne Chiu later this week . Mr Chiu will visit China from April 7 to 11 to plan a meeting between SEF chairman Koo Chen-fu and Wang Dao-han , head of China 's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait , in Singapore later this month . The association , like the SEF , is a non-governmental body which handles ties between the two sides in the absence of official ties . Taiwan has banned official contact with Beijing since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949 . But trade and civilian ties have expanded rapidly since political tensions eased in the late 1980s . The Singapore meeting would focus on ways to protect Taiwanese investment in China and co-operation to fight crime .
