when brad roller president and founder of swiger coil systems a cleveland electric motor parts maker spoke up about the high cost of health insurance for his employees he quickly found himself in charge of a plan to help small businesses get affordable coverage that was nine years ago today as insurance chairman for the cleveland chamber of commerces council of smaller enterprises roller is still fighting that fight and cleveland is serving as a model for other communities where smallbusiness owners are grappling with the exorbitant costs of providing health insurance to their workers serious talk of state and federal healthinsurance mandates have sent a chill through small businesses generally many business owners attending a smallbusiness retreat in palm springs this month said they would be forced to lay off workers if they had to provide health insurance for everyone the current crisis was precipitated by skyrocketing healthcare costs which have been increasing at about 15 a year as premiums rose and insurance companies became more selective in offering coverage more and more smallbusiness owners found themselves squeezed out of the affordable insurance market some politicians especially sen edward m kennedy dmass point to the shocking fact that between 31 million and 37 million americans have no health insurance the desperate need for affordable health insurance was the major issue tackled at the palm springs conference sponsored by national small business united a washingtonbased grassroots group of smallbusiness owners one afternoon representatives from the medical profession hospitals smallbusiness organizations government agencies and insurance industry associations grappled with the complex challenge of providing affordable coverage the insurance industry knows it cant be businessasusual anymore james dorsch washington counsel for the health insurance assn of america told the group in response to the crisis he predicted the 1990s will be the decade when insurance companies become healthcare managers instead of just paying the bills roller said clevelands quest for affordable insurance for small businesses began in 1974 when smallbusiness owners organized themselves into a single group for coverage purposes and asked blue cross the giant insurance provider to offer them a discount on premiums blue cross agreed to a 10 discount but by 1981 rising premiums were eating away at the discount and roller was back in the fray we had to do something roller said cleveland was the fourth most expensive city in the us for health care today 7000 small and mediumsized companies participate in 14 different plans primarily with blue cross but with other insurance providers as well the plans cover 125000 smallbusiness employees and their dependents who paid $ 115 million in premiums last year we save our members an incredible amount of money said roller who frequently is called upon to explain the program to other smallbusiness leaders what we are doing in cleveland could be done by a significant number of small companies across the country he said in california gov george deukmejian recently jolted business owners by outlining a plan that would require all employers to provide some kind of healthcare coverage to workers everyone will have to pitch in and give a little to make health care affordable and available the states insurance commissioner roxani gillespie told the gathering employers will have to provide insurance or pick up the costs linda diamond director of the american medical assns private sector outreach said the ama is seeking to reduce rates for malpractice insurance because the premiums can increase a patients bill by about 15 she said doctors now tend to order more tests before making a diagnosis because they are forced to practice defensive medicine after the session several business owners said they plan to take the initiative in solving the insurance problem before the government steps in business owners are being pressed to seek creative alternatives including selfinsurance programs designed to cut costs one los angeles firm founded by a former executive at a major insurance company sets up customtailored insurance programs for companies with 50 to 500 employees we design partially limited selffunded insurance plans which allow small companies to do what the fortune 500 companies have been doing for years said robert turell founder and chairman of insurance design associates turell said a selffunded plan can save a company between 15 and 20 on its insurance costs it works like this the company agrees to pay the everyday costs of providing healthcare services for its employees within certain limits then it buys reinsurance to cover more expensive and catastrophic claims the employee gets the same benefits he had before but in this way a firm can have tailormade coverage and control the costs turell said he has set up about 100 custom insurance plans in the last 3 12 years he said companies also can save on administrative costs unlike an insurance company which charges fees based on a percentage of total claims paid a benefits administrator usually charges about $ 10 a month per employee to manage an insurance program turell who has several major law firms as clients said one company with 250 employees saved about $ 150000 a year by partially selfinsuring
