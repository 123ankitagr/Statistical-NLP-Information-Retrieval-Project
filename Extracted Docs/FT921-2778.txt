on burma's western border moslem refugees fleeing persecution are streaming into bangladesh at the rate of 5,000 a day on the eastern border thai forces are on alert and another refugee exodus is feared in rangoon the capital one of the world's most authoritarian regimes is relentlessly tightening its hold on power mrs khaleda zia prime minister of bangladesh is this week visiting the us to ask president george bush and the united nations security council to intervene in the refugee crisis at least 200,000 moslems known as rohingyas from burma's western arakan state are living in makeshift camps in bangladesh they have fled the burmese army which according to their detailed and consistent accounts has unleashed a terrifying campaign of rape torture killing and forced evictions to make them leave close to the border with thailand burmese forces are engaged in another fierce offensive against ethnic minorities as karen rebels who have been joined by other opposition groups grimly defend their base at manerplaw thai fighter pilots have been ordered to attack burmese aircraft which enter thailand's air space in pursuit of the rebels and at the weekend thai artillery opened fire on burmese troops which had crossed the border to attack the karen base from the rear the attacks on ethnic minorities are part of a drive by burma's ruling state law and order restoration council slorc to establish its grip on all walks of life the military junta took power in 1988 as pro-democracy demonstrations were sweeping the country it held elections in 1990, but has ignored their result it has kept the 1991 nobel peace prize winner aung san suu kyi leader of the opposition party which won a landslide victory in the poll under house arrest since july 1989 to try to squash numerous ethnic rebellions on the borders the military is undergoing a rapid expansion when the slorc came to power in 1988 the military was about 180,000 strong now it is believed to have more than 250,000 men and that the number will double to some 500,000 by the end of the century the intention burma-watchers say is to enmesh the army so deeply in the bureaucracy and state institutions that it can never be removed even if it does one day allow civilians some measure of participation in the political process burmese people offer little comment on what the government is doing against the moslems and karens for them the campaigns are just another example of the extremes to which the army is prepared to go to establish total control over the whole of the country the military government in rangoon denies allegations of ill-treatment of moslems and through the tightly controlled media accuses foreign news organisations of attacking the country with fabricated reports it says the rohingyas are not one of burma's native ethnic groups and that the refugees are illegal immigrants or ignorant locals who have been lured away by rohingya terrorists foreign residents in rangoon say that a big immigration check has been under way in arakan state and that the military has been expanding its barracks and roads in the area they say the government has been concerned that members of the karen ethnic group which is fighting for its own homeland in south-eastern burma have been trying to infiltrate western parts of the country they fear the possibility of the karens giving support to separatists there on the streets of burma's slowly decaying cities few soldiers are visible an indication says a foreigner in rangoon of just how confident they the military are there are however said to be soldiers hidden in many buildings and stationed on the outskirts of the bigger cities where they can be quickly called on if needed there are thousands of military informers scattered throughout the population and even the most innocent of conversations is reported the government controls everything says the young driver of a pedal taxi nearly two years after the election the slorc shows no intention of giving up power political activity is on hold says one diplomat they've got the place very very tightly sewn up of more than 200 political parties which registered for the may 1990 election just 32 remain all are monitored by the authorities none is allowed to organise or even discuss anti-government activity universities are closed and university teachers have been sent on political re-education courses many former pro-democracy politicians and student activists have fled the country and many others are in prison amnesty international has identified 1,500 political prisoners by name and the us state department has estimated the full number to be about 2,000 reports of torture and ill-treatment are common the government aware that it is not popular at home sometimes explains through the newspapers or giant red billboards in the streets that life will get easier as stability returns the army will never betray the national cause one such board reads it is also aware that it is vulnerable to growing economic discontent and is seeking to do something about the chaotic economy sources in rangoon say it has drawn up a four-year economic plan the main aims are to revive exports increase agricultural productivity and boost efficiency of state enterprises shortages of inputs such as fertiliser and electricity will make that difficult the slorc is believed to want to encourage joint ventures with foreign companies however burma's poor international standing and the publicity attracted by persecution of ethnic minorities may make this increasingly difficult the slorc ended 26 years of the burmese road to socialism when it took power and announced that there would be an open economy a foreign investment law was passed prompting a flurry of activity thai companies are involved in logging burma's forests singapore japan and south korea have significant involvement in the country pepsico of the us set up a bottling plant while amoco and unocal of the us bhp of australia japan's idemitsu and shell are among 10 foreign oil companies which signed contracts to work in burma however repatriation of profits requires cabinet approval bureaucracy is a nightmare and corruption is endemic foreign trade has increased substantially though much of what is available on the streets is the result of rampant smuggling not long ago it was impossible to buy a light bulb or a tube of toothpaste but today shops are full of chinese japanese and western-made goods almost anything can be bought at rangoon's night markets and foreign films are popular some burmese have done well out of the new economic openness they are very rich but we don't know where they get it from says a young restaurant worker who like most people is struggling to make a living inflation is high rice prices rose by more than 60 per cent last year and there is a shortage of petrol at the government pumps while on the black market the price per gallon is six times higher as a result transport is scarce economic sanctions by foreign countries say burmese dissidents living in exile may be the only way to bring the slorc down but though the us and european countries have taken measures to isolate burma a full-scale embargo seems a long way away telling pressure could be exerted by south-east asian neighbours most have made individual protests but they have refused to take a united stand in the absence of strong external pressure and with domestic opposition kept in check the slorc seems set to continue its repression
