seeing that richard reeves was reviewing ronald reagans an american life i knew hed insert his own personal hatred for reagan and i wasnt wrong in a most biased bigoted review he pictures reagan as an ambitious aggressive politician who joyfully threw the poor into the streets and enriched the rich this is utter rubbish and libelous to boot reagan was propelled into politics by other forces and is far from being a callous brute he worked his way up from poverty which i bet reeves never did this review is like asking that other liberal ted kennedy to review the life of william f buckley jr reeves is now writing the biography of jfk wan na bet he writes glowingly about this shallow inept adulterous president sidney reed hawthorne
