with all the press given to turning george afb into a major commercial airport col one aug 26 complete with highspeed rail links it makes me wonder if there isnt a better nearterm use for this site why doesnt the pentagon relocate the marines from el toro mcas to george afb this would keep george a military air base for which it was designed and allow el toro to be used as orange countys muchneeded los angelesreliever airport george afb is much larger than el toro is far closer to the marine corps facilities at twentynine palms and fort irwin and is still only 65 air miles from el toro if close proximity to camp pendleton is a must using george afb as a commercial airport may make sense for the year 2000 and beyond however using el toro mcas as orange countys commercial airport makes sense now gordon g carbonetti van nuys
