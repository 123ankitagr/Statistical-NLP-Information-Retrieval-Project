with all the press given to turning george afb into a major commercial airport col one aug 26 complete with high-speed rail links it makes me wonder if there isn't a better near-term use for this site why doesn't the pentagon relocate the marines from el toro mcas to george afb this would keep george a military air base for which it was designed and allow el toro to be used as orange county's much-needed los angeles-reliever airport george afb is much larger than el toro is far closer to the marine corps facilities at twenty-nine palms and fort irwin and is still only 65 air miles from el toro if close proximity to camp pendleton is a must using george afb as a commercial airport may make sense for the year 2000 and beyond however using el toro mcas as orange county's commercial airport makes sense now gordon g carbonetti van nuys
