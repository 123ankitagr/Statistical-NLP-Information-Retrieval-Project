Spike Lee , who gained an Oscar nomination this year for `` Do the Right Thing , '' won best picture and best director awards for the same film Thursday from Chicago film critics . Danny Aiello was named best supporting actor for his performance in Lee 's critically acclaimed movie about racial passions in a Brooklyn neighborhood . The print and broadcast critics gave their best actor award to Tom Cruise for `` Born on the Fourth of July , '' and best actress honors went to Michelle Pfeiffer for `` The Fabulous Baker Boys . '' Lee snared an Oscar nomination for best screenplay with `` Do the Right Thing '' but missed out on on a best director nomination in Hollywood . In accepting the awards , Lee attacked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences , which awards the Oscars and which this year showered its leading nominations on `` Driving Miss Daisy . ''
