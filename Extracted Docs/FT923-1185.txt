i am either on the phone or away from my desk please leave a message after the tone to reach my assistant press one to reach an operator press zero to skip this message in the future press the key if you are a regular caller to companies in the us this type of greeting played by voice messaging or voice mail systems is already familiar it provides an efficient if somewhat irritating and impersonal means of communication in its basic form voice messaging is merely a computerised answering service that records and replays telephone messages however the latest systems integrate voice with facsimile and electronic mail transforming the telephone into a multimedia communications terminal voice mail is a technology that americans love to hate but they are using it in everincreasing numbers an estimated onethird of all large and mediumsized companies in the us already use voice messaging and many residential telephone users also have access to voice mail services provided by regional telephone companies ten or 15 years ago if you called someone and got an answering machine you wondered who that person was trying to avoid speaking to today if a call is not answered by a person or machine you wonder the same thing who are they trying to avoid says george sollman president and chief executive of centigram an early leader in the voice messaging systems market that shows the extent to which we have adapted to the technology not so in europe and asia however where sales of voice messaging systems have been slower to take off in part it seems because there is more resistance to talking to machines in europe there are also regulatory hurdles it takes about six months and costs about dollars 500000 pounds 280000 to obtain approval from a european ptt national telephone company to connect a voice messaging system to the phone network says douglas chance president of octel communications the largest us supplier of voice messaging systems yet as octel and other voice messaging system manufacturers step up their international marketing efforts voice mail appears set to become more widely accepted voice mail is catching on in europe as a service for users of car phones the system picks up messages while the user is not in the car or when the telephone is turned off in the us however voice mail is viewed primarily as a productivity tool especially among the many companies that are downsizing and cutting support staff with fewer secretaries to take messages the voice mail system ensures that calls do not go unanswered unlike the standard answering machine a voice mail system picks up calls when you are already on the telephone most systems also give callers a generous amount of time to record their message and the opportunity to review what they have said perhaps the biggest advantage of voice mail is that it eliminates telephone tag if the other party is on the phone or away from my desk it is always possible to leave a message as people get used to the system they leave more substantive messages and no longer feel the need to talk directly to one other messages that are too complicated or too sensitive to be relayed by a third party can also be delivered in confidence to a voice mail box companies with international operations find voice messaging a more personal alternative to electronicmail or facsimile for sending messages across time zones hotels are beginning to install voice mail as a service to guests so that callers are able to leave accurate confidential messages in any language voice messaging services can also provide a communications lifeline in emergency situations following the devastating explosions that destroyed the reforma district of guadalajara mexico earlier this year telefonos de mexico telmex swiftly transformed its corporate voice mail service into an emergency message system in normal circumstances however voice messaging simply provides improved communications capabilities the full potential of voice messaging is just beginning to emerge with the introduction of voice processing systems that allow users to access a wide range of services over the telephone the caller can tap into broadcast news services retrieve and update computer database records initiate or receive facsimile and electronic mail messages and even have them read by a computer generated voice sollman describes how a voice processing power call works he is on a business trip a call to his voice mail box alerts him to an urgent fax sent to the office which is then read to him by the centigram system a customer wants a quotation on a customised voice messaging system having listened to the message he taps in the fax number of the hotel where he is staying and a copy is automatically routed to him the customers request requires immediate attention and several people on sollmans staff need to be alerted from his hotel room telephone sollman records a voice mail annotation urging action on the customers request he sends the message and the original fax to a predetermined list of colleagues by pressing a few keys on the phone voice processing can similarly provide links with electronic mail and computer databases or information services interactive voice response systems which enable the caller to speak directly to a computer and be understood also promise to broaden the applications of voice processing each of the leading voice processing systems manufacturers has its own specialty centigram has taken a lead in the use of computerised text to speech translation octel is offering features that turn the touchtone telephone keys into a primitive keyboard to type facsimile messages select news or traffic reports and post electronic mail messages vmx another voice messaging systems company is building a broad range of applications by encouraging thirdparty software developers to write programs for its systems voice messaging specialists are however facing increased competition from manufacturers of private branch exchange equipment such as att northern telecom and rolm which are offering voice messaging as an adjunct to their pbx systems and although voice processing systems manufacturers claim that their products are complementary to computer network systems it seems certain that the two industry segments will eventually collide while voice processing systems are beginning to access data processing systems computers are acquiring many of the attributes of voice processing including business audio features that enable the user to record spoken messages and incorporate them in text and graphics documents talking to machines may still be an uncomfortable experience for many but by the end of the decade it is likely to be commonplace worse it seems that these computerised systems will increasingly talk back to us perhaps the only consolation is that when talking to computers we can be as rude as we please without causing offence
