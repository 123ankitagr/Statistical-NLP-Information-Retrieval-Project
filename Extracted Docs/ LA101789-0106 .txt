A drug used for more than a decade to treat psoriasis is preventing and halting the rejection of transplanted organs in animals , a Stanford University researcher said . The compound will be tested on human transplant patients pending approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration , said Dr. Randall Morris , director of Stanford 's laboratory for transplant immunology . The drug mycophenolic acid inhibits the formation of DNA , critical in the growth of skin lesions common to psoriasis . Researchers altered mycophenolic acid to make it more easily absorbed by the body . In its altered form , it defuses the DNA process required for white blood cells to attack transplanted organs , Morris said .
