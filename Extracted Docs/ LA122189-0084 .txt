A contract has been awarded to the Moran Construction Co. of Alhambra to build a $ 6-million administration building for the Lynwood Unified School District . Construction of the three-story building is scheduled to start early next year and be completed in 16 months . It will be at 11321 Bullis Road , directly across the street from Lynwood City Hall on a portion of Hosler Junior High School land . The new building will replace the overcrowded administration facility , which is in a shopping center in the city 's redevelopment area and is expected to be sold to the Lynwood Redevelopment Agency . The new building is being paid for with money raised by the sale of certificates of participation , a financing tool similar to bonds . The building will be large enough to accommodate 120 district employees .
