Shareholders Group Sues First Interstate : A class-action suit has been filed against First Interstate Bancorp , alleging that the bank holding company misled shareholders about the faltering financial conditions of two of its banks . The suit specifically charges that bank executives misled `` thousands of persons who purchased shares in First Interstate Bank '' between Jan. 18 , when the company reported 1988 fourth-quarter earnings of $ 144 million , and Dec. 7 , when the company said it would add $ 400 million to its loan reserves , mostly for problems at its Texas bank .
