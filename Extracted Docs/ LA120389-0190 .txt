as a resident of neighboring orange i thoroughly enjoyed your sunday editorial tustin springs backward nov 26 about the tustin city council's unprecedented decision to shift its city elections from november to april thereby allowing potential challengers only four months to organize their campaigns it should also be noted that mayor richard b edgar had previously stated that a special april election would attract better-informed voters by that he presumably means better informed by himself or mayor pro tem ursula e kennedy but not by his opponents who would be hard-pressed for time to effectively present their own views and who lack the financial resources of developers contributions that mayor edgar so richly enjoys himself i sincerely hope that tustin residents will succeed in challenging the election-date switch and return a sense of fairness to its elected government walter adams orange
