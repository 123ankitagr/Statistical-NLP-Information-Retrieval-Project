the world's pharmaceutical companies are conducting a romance with mother nature lured by the novel compounds that only nature can concoct established giants such as smithkline beecham merck and glaxo and a host of small start-ups are scouring the world's forests for the next blockbuster medicine although drug discovery is always risky many scientists believe there is a good chance of finding interesting medicinal compounds in nature especially in the species-rich tropical rain forests plants and other forms of life have historically been an important source of medicines morphine is derived from opium for example and penicillin is a fungal metabolite moreover there are some 250,000 species of flowering plants in the world and only 1,100 of them have been investigated thoroughly for their medicinal properties you don't have to be a rocket scientist to figure out that you may find something in the remaining 99.5 per cent said michael balick director of the institute of economic botany at the new york botanical garden the field was given an enormous boost by taxol a promising anticancer compound derived from the bark of the pacific yew tree a conifer found in the remaining virgin forests of the us's pacific northwest taxol is now being tested against ovarian and breast cancers the us national cancer institute first discovered taxol in the 1960 s but saw its natural products program languish in the 1980 s the institute is now screening thousands of plants marine creatures and micro-organisms for activity against human cancers searching the world's plants for drugs became passe among researchers in the last two decades as the molecular and computer-driven route to drug synthesis eclipsed any other method of discovering medicines today armed with new techniques borrowed from biotechnology companies can screen thousands of chemical extracts from plants for activity against human cancers and other diseases in a very short period there is obviously a lot of renewed interest in this area said randall johnson director of biomolecular discovery at smithkline beecham's us headquarters in philadelphia every month interesting compounds from nature are emerging from these new mechanism-based screens and nature is proving to be a very rich source of compounds that can combat human disease he said in europe a product from the ginko tree one of the oldest living trees called ginkolyte is used extensively to promote blood flow james mcchesney director of the research institute for pharmaceutical sciences at the university of mississippi estimates the compound generates as much as dollars 300 m a year in sales in europe smithkline beecham is now clinically testing a plant-derived drug called topotecan as a treatment for ovarian cancer the drug is an analog of campotothecin a compound extracted from trees in china and india campotothecin was originally discovered by the national cancer institute in the easy 1960 s but proved too toxic in cancer patients and was dropped from the nci's programme smithkline resurrected it a number of years later creating a water-soluble analog that was less toxic said johnson glaxo too has an interest in campotothecin the company is studying analogs of the compound and it is searching for new plant medicines as part of a research consortium with the university of illinois in chicago one of the leading academic centres involved in medicinal plants we are not looking so much at medicines from plants per se but substances that can be improved modified and refined for a safe and effective drug said rick sluder a glaxo spokesman another promising product is artemisinin an antimalarial drug originally derived from a plant found in china and south-east asia according to mcchesney the excitement is that the compound is effective for drug-resistant malaria and is practically a miraculous drug for cerebral malaria a serious form of the disease he said so far there are no obstacles to obtaining large quantities of the plant artemesia annua from which the compound is derived is a worldwide naturalised weed said mcchesney you could probably find it growing in a vacant lot in new york city he said the controversy surrounding taxol has underscored the issue of supply conservationists are worried that in the rush to extract taxol from the bark of the pacific yew tree remaining stands of the tree will be obliterated however mcchesney said researchers have now found that taxol can be extracted from the yew's needles rather than its bark amid the resurgence of interest in plant medicines many small start-up companies have emerged with novel approaches to drug discovery shaman pharmaceuticals based in san carlos california for example is exploring traditional plant-derived medicines already used by native tribes and communities by using traditional knowledge there is greater likelihood of yielding an active compound or a pharmaceutical said lisa conte shaman's president shaman is the traditional name for medicine man founded in 1989, the company already has two drugs in clinical trials one is an anti-viral drug against respiratory infections the second is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent derived from a plant used by native tribes in north america and africa for the treatment of infections conte claimed that by using traditional medicines shaman's hit rate the number of times screening finds a compound with activity against a certain target is one in two extracts versus the mass screening process in large pharmaceutical companies which is one in thousands shaman has policies for compensating countries where its drugs are found we are creating an economic alternative to rain forest destruction said conte if they can make a living by collecting our products it gives them an incentive for leaving the forests intact compensating a country where a drug is discovered is a controversial idea in the pharmaceutical industry but balick of the new york botanical garden said that drug companies are now much more receptive to the notion last year for example merck signed an innovative agreement with costa rica's national institute of biodiversity that could be one model for how the industry could negotiate agreements that would direct money back into source countries under the agreement merck paid the institute dollars 51 m for the right to analyse indigenous plants and animals for possible medicines or other products
