weight control depends on a basic equation create a caloric deficit between what you consume and what you expend and you will lose weight create a caloric overload by eating more calories than you burn and you will add weight that simple fact holds true despite hundreds of articles promising weight loss without having to eat one bite less or walk one step more critics in the antiexercise camp are fond of pointing out that for a 130pound woman to burn off the calories in a slice of apple pie she must bicycle for 68 minutes at nine miles an hour swim the crawl 53 minutes or do 83 minutes of brisk walking covering four miles an hour add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and it would take 113 minutes of cycling 88 minutes of swimming and 131 minutes walking briskly that they argue is an unreasonable amount of exertion for one modest dessert and by extension of faulty logic exercise is of no help in weight control we come down firmly on the other side in the debate people on weightreducing diets or for that matter anyone concerned about cholesterol should not be eating pie a la mode in the first place except on special occasions exercise essential the heart of the matter is this no weightloss program should be without an exercise component exercise burns calories and the more you do the more calories you burn increased physical activity does not always require jumping onto a bike or wriggling into a swimsuit although those are wonderful ways of using up calories and boosting cardiovascular fitness it can take a much simpler form such as using the stairs instead of the elevator at work or getting off the bus a stop farther from home and walking the rest of the way back whatever the combination of activities an increased daily output of 500 calories will lead to the loss of a pound in about a week without having to reduce caloric intake by a single bite if 500 calories a day seems like too much especially at the outset be content with less keeping in mind that it will just take a little longer to reach your goal if youre out of shape when you begin to exercise youll probably notice that the more you do the easier it gets thats all to the good oxygen is required to burn off fat during exercise and aerobic exercise enlarges the bodys capacity to use oxygen in practical terms this allows you to move around at a higher intensity thereby burning more calories than if you did the same activity slowly you will also notice that you are able to go longer without tiring energy use at rest exercise fosters the creation of a caloric imbalance in other ways too in recent years much research has focused on the effects of exercise on resting energy expenditure the number of calories used in carrying out basic body functions lean body mass is more active metabolically than fat and therefore burns more calories dieting especially when calories are severely restricted results in the loss of both body fat and muscle the loss of lean tissue in turn leads to a decline in resting energy expenditure thats obviously counterproductive to efforts at weight loss on the other hand exercise that helps build muscle can be expected to prevent a decline or even bring an increase in resting energy expenditure beyond these benefits exercise has also been found to decrease appetite and promote a psychological sense of wellbeing getting started on an exercise regimen is really a threestep process it is a good idea to start with a medical evaluation especially if you are over 40 and underexercised step two is to select activities appropriate to your fitness level and life style third do an audit of your weekday and weekend routines planning ahead for the type and amount of exercise you might find reasonable as you proceed through the first week keep a diary of what worked and what failed that will help you to plan a more realistic program for the next week above all stick with it they say that nothing succeeds like success one of the most effective morale boosters and dietary aids we know is the feeling you get from looking in the mirror and seeing an improved figure in the glass not only thinner but welltoned besides while dieting can help you reach a weight goal only springing into action can give you the look and feel of fitness that comes with having a wellexercised body stress formula capsules provide way to sell unnecessary vitamins question i was browsing in a healthfood store when a salesperson noticing my briefcase engaged in a conversation in which she assumed that i must have a highstress job accordingly she tried to sell me a stressformula vitamin preparation i resisted but later found myself wondering whether stress increases nutrient requirements does it answer no the operative word here is not nutrition but marketing stressformula vitamin capsules are just one more way of marketing large doses of vitamins usually b vitamins and vitamin c that nobody needs often the promotions for these preparations suggest that smokers need more vitamin c or that oral contraceptives increase requirements for folacin and vitamin b6 while it may be that for these groups biochemical measurements for some nutrients may be lower than among the general population levels are still well within normal range indeed there is no objective evidence to indicate that smoking use of oral contraceptives or increased emotional stress raise the need for vitamins higher than the recommended dietary allowances rdas these allowances are best met by a varied diet of fresh and lightly processed foods accompanied if you wish by a single multivitamin pill containing no more than 100 of the rdas for any nutrient so even if your briefcase does signal a position fraught with emotional stress there is no reason to believe that your coping skills will be enhanced by taking a highpotency vitamin pill q what is the nutritional value of a nectarine a a nectarine weighing five ounces provides about 65 calories as for vitamins its most notable contribution if it is a deepyellow nectarine is vitamin a providing about 20 of the us recommended daily allowance it also contains small amounts of b vitamins and some vitamin c and for those individuals who are taking antidiuretic medications it provides generous amounts of potassium while nectarines are commonly thought of as a relatively modern cross between a peach and a plum their origins go back into the mists of history the fruit is related to both the almond and the rose families and apparently was a delicacy in ancient china and the near east more than 2000 years ago its possible that nectarines may even predate the modern peach q how prevalent is breastfeeding nowadays and how common is the practice among working women a since 1955 ross laboratories has used mail questionnaires to monitor breast feeding results of the 1987 survey reported recently in pediatrics the journal of the american academy of pediatrics indicate that approximately 55 of all women breast fed their infants while they were in the hospital but among some groups rates were considerably different for example rates tended to be higher among women not employed outside the home at least 30 years old in high familyincome groups college educated white and living in the rocky mountain or pacific regions comparison of breastfeeding rates in relation to work was limited to those who reported working fulltime and those who said that they were not employed outside the home by the time the infants were 6 months old only 10 of the women who were working fulltime were still breastfeeding compared to 243 of those who were not working we reiterate that not working means not employed outside the home we recognize that being a mother is a job unto itself but a comparison between working and nonworking women tells only part of the story among white nonworking mothers in the pacific region for example almost 80 were breast feeding in the hospital and 38 of them were still doing so six months later on the other hand the incidence of continued breast feeding among those who returned to fulltime employment was higher among black women especially those who were at least 25 years old in higherincome groups who had college educations the upshot is that while fulltime employment does not deter women from breast feeding in the hospital it seems to have a considerable impact on their continuing to do so there are a number of reasons for this for one thing some women find nursing to be an extra burden in an already hectic existence for another daycare arrangements usually do not provide conditions favorable to breast feeding q in a recent column about beef hormones you alluded to problems with the federal inspection system can you tell me more a both the food and drug administration and the food safety inspection service agencies charged with monitoring our food supply are undermanned and overworked the fsis has been mandated by the law to focus its resources on problem areas and is cutting back on its work force down to 7000 inspectors last year from about 10000 in 1980 fda has about 700 inspectors and scientists to deal with its many responsibilities not just for foods but for drugs and cosmetics during the recent furor over poisoned chilean grapes some inspectors had to be pulled from other tasks to check fruit from chile this left other foods unmonitored for that period our food supply remains the safest in the world but we want to keep it that way ironically at a time when consumers are more concerned than ever with health and safety issues surrounding food we are chipping away at a line of defense by undermining the strength of the fda and the fsis
