north america now is launched tomorrow at a time of fierce debate over how governments should best help exporters britain is not alone in discovering that sustained non-inflationary growth is better driven by exports than domestic demand nor is it alone in worrying about widening trade gaps the us campaign is expected to include unique and innovative initiatives to counter criticism that previous government efforts have targeted the export-willing' but have been less successful in pinpointing the export-ready' a core worry for the british government is that a few exporters account for a large proportion of exports 50 companies are responsible for about 44 per cent of visible exports totalling pounds 108 m last year as a result export promotion is invariably targeted at smaller companies often with limited success there is widespread concern that government efforts to aid exporters often miss the mark trade missions are often dismissed as jollies backing for companies to attend trade fairs is attacked as unco-ordinated the value of export promotion campaigns like those focused on venezuela spain and kuwait over the past five years has been questioned though export figures provide unclear evidence because they can be influenced by forces ranging from the recession to currency fluctuations mr graham bannock consultant to the department of trade and industry on a number of trade issues and author of an influential government report on exporting says export campaigns don't generate much in the way of exports but it's terribly difficult to prove anything business leaders such as mr simon sperry chief executive of the london chamber of commerce say there is disarray on how export services are delivered with too many agencies competing for funding mr ian campbell at the institute of export asks when organisations such as the institute of freight forwarders the confederartion of british industry institute of marketing chambers of commerce and institute of directors last met jointly or co-ordinated efforts we need a more co-operative corporate structure he says mr campbell notes that the budget of the british overseas trade board last year was pounds 173 m enough to run the health service for 25 hours apart from concern that there is too little money for export promotion there is criticism about lack of continuity at the top of the dti which has had 16 trade secretaries in 24 years mr michael heseltine the present trade and industry secretary and his deputy mr richard needham appear to have impressed industry with their early efforts to tailor government activities to exporters needs many industrialists would say that this is long overdue in a country where exports account for 18 per cent of gross domestic product according to one senior cbi executive the fact that the government is now using the word strategy is an important change from the past it's not providing a very complete strategy but at least it has started to use the word mr needham yesterday identified three prongs to his export promotion strategy services to improve competitiveness and exportability of british products particularly in industrial markets aid to the capital goods industry in developing country markets with a target of raising capital goods exports from pounds 10 bn in 1993 to pounds 20 bn by 2000 protecting british trading interests in forums such as the general agreement on tariffs and trade and in bilateral trade conflicts over products like steel and cars or on taxation of international companies his strategy is distinctive in its conviction that export promotion starts with private industry and at the regional level it also focuses on improving the wider manufacturing base rather than just exports with local economy promotion one area of general complaint in the uk is export finance where premium rates to insure exports are often significantly higher than rates offered to exporters from other countries mr bannock said export finance was the one area where the uk government is demonstrably doing less than other governments the government has made a strong effort to build into the north america now campaign policies that meet industry complaints its details will be scrutinised with care not just because the us is britain's most important export market but because it will provide clear evidence of whether mr heseltine is putting his own more effective stamp on britain's export efforts export promotions are they on target 1990 1991 1992 other initaitives and their exports pds bn pds bn pds bn spain 1991 spotlight spain 3.75 4.29 4.41 kuwait 1991 reconstructed kuwait 0.18 0.18 0.26 venezuela 1991 projecto venezuela 0.21 0.17 0.19 total exports 103.70 104.82 108.30 source cso
