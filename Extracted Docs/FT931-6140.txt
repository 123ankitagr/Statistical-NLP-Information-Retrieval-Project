North America Now - is launched tomorrow at a time of fierce debate over how governments should best help exporters . Britain is not alone in discovering that sustained , non-inflationary growth is better driven by exports than domestic demand . Nor is it alone in worrying about widening trade gaps . The US campaign is expected to include unique and innovative initiatives to counter criticism that previous government efforts have targeted the 'export-willing ' , but have been less successful in pinpointing the 'export-ready ' . A core worry for the British government is that a few exporters account for a large proportion of exports - 50 companies are responsible for about 44 per cent of visible exports totalling Pounds 108m last year . As a result , export promotion is invariably targeted at smaller companies , often with limited success . There is widespread concern that government efforts to aid exporters often miss the mark . Trade missions are often dismissed as 'jollies ' ; backing for companies to attend trade fairs is attacked as unco-ordinated . The value of export promotion campaigns - like those focused on Venezuela , Spain and Kuwait over the past five years - has been questioned , though export figures provide unclear evidence because they can be influenced by forces ranging from the recession to currency fluctuations . Mr Graham Bannock , consultant to the Department of Trade and Industry on a number of trade issues , and author of an influential government report on exporting , says : 'Export campaigns do n't generate much in the way of exports . But it 's terribly difficult to prove anything . ' Business leaders such as Mr Simon Sperry , chief executive of the London Chamber of Commerce , say there is disarray on how export services are delivered , with too many agencies competing for funding . Mr Ian Campbell , at the Institute of Export , asks when organisations such as the Institute of Freight Forwarders , the Confederartion of British Industry , Institute of Marketing , chambers of commerce and Institute of Directors last met jointly or co-ordinated efforts . 'We need a more co-operative corporate structure , ' he says . Mr Campbell notes that the budget of the British Overseas Trade Board last year was Pounds 173m - 'enough to run the health service for 25 hours ' . Apart from concern that there is too little money for export promotion , there is criticism about lack of continuity at the top of the DTI , which has had 16 trade secretaries in 24 years . Mr Michael Heseltine , the present trade and industry secretary , and his deputy Mr Richard Needham , appear to have impressed industry with their early efforts to tailor government activities to exporters ' needs . Many industrialists would say that this is long overdue in a country where exports account for 18 per cent of gross domestic product . According to one senior CBI executive : 'The fact that the government is now using the word 'strategy ' is an important change from the past . It 's not providing a very complete strategy , but at least it has started to use the word . ' Mr Needham yesterday identified three prongs to his export promotion strategy : Services to improve competitiveness and exportability of British products , particularly in industrial markets . Aid to the capital goods industry in developing country markets , with a target of raising capital goods exports from Pounds 10bn in 1993 to Pounds 20bn by 2000 . Protecting British trading interests in forums such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and in bilateral trade conflicts over products like steel and cars , or on taxation of international companies . His strategy is distinctive in its conviction that export promotion starts with private industry , and at the regional level . It also focuses on improving the wider manufacturing base rather than just exports , with 'local economy promotion ' . One area of general complaint in the UK is export finance , where premium rates to insure exports are often significantly higher than rates offered to exporters from other countries . Mr Bannock said export finance was 'the one area where the UK government is demonstrably doing less than other governments ' . The government has made a strong effort to build into the North America Now campaign policies that meet industry complaints . Its details will be scrutinised with care - not just because the US is Britain 's most important export market , but because it will provide clear evidence of whether Mr Heseltine is putting his own , more effective , stamp on Britain 's export efforts . -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - EXPORT PROMOTIONS : ARE THEY ON TARGET ? -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - 1990 1991 1992 Other initaitives and their exports Pds bn Pds bn Pds bn -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - SPAIN : 1991 'Spotlight Spain ' 3.75 4.29 4.41 KUWAIT : 1991 'Reconstructed Kuwait ' 0.18 0.18 0.26 VENEZUELA : 1991 'Projecto Venezuela ' 0.21 0.17 0.19 TOTAL EXPORTS 103.70 104.82 108.30 -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - Source : CSO -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -
