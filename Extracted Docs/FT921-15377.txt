the german state railway monopoly the bundesbahn yesterday signed a document of intent to buy 114 spanish railway wagons for dollars 80m pounds 427m to mark the first time that spain has been able to export its unique talgo railway technology the deal which the chairman of the bundesbahn mr heinz durr was due to sign in madrid last night was triggered by spains decision in 1988 to award a dollars 350m contract for 75 highpowered locomotives to siemens the talgo wagons are produced by a joint venture between renfe the spanish railway monopoly and a privatelyowned basque group talgo the spanish acronym for the goicoecheaoriol light articulated train is a technology developed more than 40 years ago by a basque engineer mr alejandro goicoechea and financed by the oriol family during the franco dictatorship franco had ordered spains railway gauge to be wider than the conventional european gauge in order it is said to deter invasions thus one characteristic of talgo is a wheel arrangement enabling it to pass from the spanish to the french gauge without stopping the bundesbahn plans to use the talgo trains on overnight routes between berlin and basle and munich and zurich talgos manufacturers claim that because it is so light it saves on engine energy and that its carriages are connected in such a way that they do not jolt essentially talgo technology is based on the fact that each wheel has its own axle placed between and not under the carriages and which can be independently manipulated this places the suspension above the point of gravity on each wagon enabling it to achieve high speeds with reduced lateral movements
