If there seems to be a bit of a power vacuum in Canberra this week , the explanation is quite simple . No less than four of Australia 's 19 cabinet ministers are in London : Gareth Evans , the foreign minister , Simon Crean , minister of primary industries and energy , Laurie Brereton , minister for industrial relations and Kim Beazley , minister for employment . Each has a busy round of meetings , ranging from discussing nuclear dumps with Douglas Hurd to woolly jumpers with the International Wool Secretariat . Also in town - what a coincidence - are the lord mayors of all Australia's state capitals . Surely this sudden interest in the mother country can not have anything to do with the second test match beginning at Lord 's today ?
