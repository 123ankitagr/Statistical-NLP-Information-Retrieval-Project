video and audio signals were thrown into the air grabbed by tv antennas 35 years ago and then we thought disappeared into the cosmos and what sights and sounds these signals possessed live drama and comedy that had a spontaneity and freshness never again equaled by an upstart medium growing into maturity most of the live television experience was lost because videotape wasnt available until 1955 quite a few tv shows however were filmed off the screen and some of these kinescopes survive they are they only record we have left of the live tv experience no program lit up the airwaves with more intensity and originality than your show of shows a 90minute comedyvariety program on saturdays from 9 to 1030 pm airing from feb 25 1950 to june 5 1954 your show of shows was created by producerdirector showman max liebman it was the original saturday night live ninety minutes of original entertainment starring four startlingly original comedians sid caesar imogene coca carl reiner and howard morris the show was written by a group of writers who today dominate american mass culture woody allen mel brooks neil simon joseph stein fiddler on the roof michael stewart hello dolly larry gelbart mash lucille kallen and mel tolkin most viewers thought these live shows were lost forever but producer liebman had collected kinescopes of many of the programs in 1976 he packaged a series of 90minute tv specials for syndication unicorn video has now issued eight volumes of these selected excerpts from your show of shows kinescoped on videotape these are not the complete original programs that included broadwayflavored singing and dancing and classy snippets of ballet and opera its a pity we cant relive the entire show singing and dancing included but thats a small complaint since each tape holds seven to eight vintage comedy sketches featuring the genius of caesar coca reiner and morris and the writers in their prime the brilliant live and unedited comedy is all here from caesars professor skits to the hilarious often flawless pantomimes to the staccato monologues to the sharptongued husbandandwife skits to the mockforeign language and silent movies and opera spoofs including adlibs unexpected mishaps and caesars always present annoying cough the first two volumes in unicorns videotape series are typical of the collection they include caesars airplane movies his original spoof of hollywoods wartime movies that initially brought caesar to liebmans attention caesars professor this time as an expert on fishing and archaeology the boarder in which wife coca takes in boarder morris without telling husband caesar this gets funnier with each viewing two famous pantomimes the violin recital and in the subway no one on tv ever was better at pantomime the nervous suitor in which an anxious caesar courts coca in one of the funniest skits ever seen on tv a caesar monologue about a man caught in the city at night without any money and a typical film satire in which the cast imitates foreign speech another superb sampling of your show of shows is a single compilation issued for motion picture release and now available on media home entertainment videotape and image entertainment laser disc ten from your show of shows a compilation of comedy sketches from 1950 to 1954 these tapes meet the crucial home video test they get better viewing after viewing they offer expert testimony that your show of shows was indeed the extraordinary achievement viewers remember a genuine classic of televisions golden age the modernday counterpart to your show of shows was producer lorne michaels saturday night live we are now able to evaluate this live comedy repeatedly through the unprecedented release of 16 volumes of saturday night live circa 19751980 warner videotape 60 minutes each watching these volumes of saturday night live as well as the best of john belushi the best of dan aykroyd and the best of gilda radner also on warner home video it becomes clear that like your show of shows the comedy that flashed once on the screen and then disappeared holds up very well for the most part it is clever inventive daring hardedged and unpredictable the coneheads or the aykroydcurtain point counterpoint or mr bill or cheesebugah cheesebugah cheesebugah or radners never mind or murrays nick winters or the loopners or the parodies of presidents network executives and best of all television past reminds you of the razorsharp often gross contemporary comedy that commercial tv had never seen before and may never see again its elements were classic political satire a keen distrust of the establishment especially business and corporations including tv corporate power and revolutionary a stripping away of all showbiz conventions and formalities a conscious attempt to turn the medium inside out with behindthescenes gallows humor a new allembracing and permissive attitude toward sex and especially drugs perhaps the best collection is the best of john belushi featuring classic belushi sketches from october 1975 to may 1979 included are of course the blues brothers and its highlight is belushi in a 1978 tom schiller film called dont look back in anger in which belushi visits the notreadyforprimetime cemetery it is a poignant gem
