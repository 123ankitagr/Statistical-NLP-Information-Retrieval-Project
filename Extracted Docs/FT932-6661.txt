the governments private finance initiative could transform the way in which important capital projects are carried out in the uk mr norman lamont told a conference organised by the confederation of british industry yesterday if true this would not be before time the comments of mr francois mitterrand on the contrast between the two rail links to the channel tunnel have merely reminded the public how urgently this transformation is needed the new rules announced in last years autumn statement overturned the treasurys longstanding view that the private sector should not undertake anything the public sector could in principle do more cheaply any project can now go ahead provided government contributions give value for money to the taxpayer private participation in joint ventures is usually decided on the basis of competition and substantial risk is assumed by the private sector the government is looking for three kinds of private involvement in infrastructure development and implementation of projects in the private sector greater use of operating leases in which the private lessor retains some responsibility for managing the asset and joint ventures between the private and public sectors such as londons crossrail there are two reasons for wanting private involvement in infrastructure the silly reason is to evade constraints imposed by limits on public borrowing the sensible one is to improve efficiency private finance is not insists the chancellor about evading public expenditure controls he protests too much one reason for the initiative is indeed to evade such arbitrary constraints the problem is not simply the treasurys past unwillingness to distinguish capital from current spending it is the failure to go beyond annual cashflow accounting what is needed is a public sector balance sheet in which increases in assets can be set against liabilities the chief justification for greater private sector involvement is however in mr lamonts words to harness private sector skills in design in construction and above all in management this is to be distinguished from pricing charging users does not entail private ownership and private ownership does not entail charging individual users what is essential is private sector risktaking otherwise hopes for greater financial discipline will be disappointed the government must not only state that financial failure will lead to liquidation but stick to that hard line in practice the governments initiative for private finance is to be welcomed mainly because it may lead to better projects though private participants must face risks if this is to happen subject to that proviso howard davies directorgeneral of the cbi was right to tell the government to get a move on the new ideas can be beneficial but not if they are stuck in the treasurys pending tray
