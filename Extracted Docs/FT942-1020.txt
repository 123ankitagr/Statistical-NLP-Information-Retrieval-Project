China is opening its shipping industry to foreign investors and is liberalising access to ports as part of attempts to meet requirements for entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade . Mr Huang Zhendong , communication minister , said Chinese partners must hold a majority stake in newly-formed ventures serving local waterways , and senior posts must be held by Chinese . Conditions for foreign investors seeking partnership in Chinese shipping are similar to those being offered for civil aviation . Beijing announced earlier this month that it would welcome foreign involvement with local airlines . Mr Huang , quoted by the official China Daily , said foreign companies would be allowed to become involved in cargo-handling at Chinese ports and would also be permitted to operate some inland and coastal shipping routes . Foreign companies could also set up wholly-owned agencies to canvas cargo , issue documents and negotiate contracts for their ships . However wholly foreign-owned businesses would be excluded from China 's domestic waterways . Foreign shippers and shipping agencies have long complained about China's highly restrictive policies , including barriers to fair access to Chinese ports . China has also made it very difficult for foreign shippers to secure contracts for mainland-sourced cargo . This has been the subject of repeated representations by large shipping lines . Mr Huang promised a 'favourable environment ' for foreign investors seeking opportunities in the development of China 's wharves . But these ventures which are vital to the national economy must have Chinese majority share . China , which is seeking to become a founder member of the World Trade Organisation when it comes into being next year . will this week step up its efforts to meet Gatt requirements . The Gatt special working group on China is due to convene in Geneva tomorrow and Chinese officials hope these discussions will help expedite entry negotiations .
