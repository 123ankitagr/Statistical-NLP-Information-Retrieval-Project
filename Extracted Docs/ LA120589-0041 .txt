A no-bail bench warrant for the arrest of Ruby Mae Brown was issued Monday by a judge after Brown failed to show up to begin her 89-day jail sentence for cruelty toward dogs in her now-closed kennel . Brown , 61 , was sentenced Thursday by San Diego Municipal Judge Robert McDonald to 89 days in jail after she refused , through her attorney , to agree to a probation condition requiring her to surrender her guns for the next three years . Her attorney , Hodge Crabtree , said Monday that he did now know where his client was . For years , Brown operated Kelly 's Pet Hotel on Morena Boulevard , which was raided frequently by animal control officers because of unsanitary conditions . It is now closed . A jury convicted Brown Oct. 25 on four counts of animal cruelty and one of interfering with a county official in the performance of his duty , all misdemeanors .
