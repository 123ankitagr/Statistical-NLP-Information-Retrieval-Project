MERGER talks between New York 's two largest commodity exchanges are progressing . In a letter to both memberships last week , the negotiating committee said the New York Mercantile Exchange had increased its initial Dollars 10m cash bid for the Commodity Exchange to Dollars 45m , with about Dollars 15m of that coming from the Comex 's own treasury . Traders said the new offer may be approved by members of both exchanges .
