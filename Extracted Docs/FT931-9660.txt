country managers used to be the barons if not the kings of most multinational companies but now most of them are being cut down to the size of mere ambassadors as their companies strive to accelerate decision-taking to slash head office costs and to achieve greater all-round global co-ordination and efficiency most of their power sometimes even over sales and distribution is being transferred either to regional czars or more often to the heads of worldwide product divisions as a result many country managers have either been pensioned off early or are suffering severe demotivation as they bow to the inevitable relegation of their role in a growing number of companies such as ici britain's largest chemicals combine country management is being reduced to a part-time representational role carried out by a senior divisional manager see this page feb 1 but should the fate of country managers be so inevitable is it even sensible or should companies treat them in a less standardised way adapting their role more carefully to the company's stage of organisational evolution and to each country's different conditions there is nothing either inevitable or sensible about a blanket approach according to the initial findings of a study being undertaken by john quelch a professor at the harvard business school companies should think far more carefully about what kind of country manager they need in each national situation says quelch they should also recognise that even when it is sensible to transfer most power to global divisions country managers can be motivated by developing new skills these include encouraging the export and import of good ideas between subsidiaries quelch is now extending his study to 200 country general managers so far it has been based on interviews with 50 executives in 12 asian european and north american multinationals in services consumer and industrial products the executives responses range from demotivation to surprising expressions of secret content at a narrowing of their responsibilities so long as they retain their titles that is in a working paper called the new country managers which describes his initial conclusions quelch quotes one executive presumably of the demotivated variety saying lugubriously that his type of role will not actually disappear since governments still need one man to go after to put in jail quelch's categorisation of country managers is in line with a suggestion in his paper that companies are evolving through several stages towards a relatively standard global type of organisation this would be disputed by fellow academics some japanese and other companies are moving in the reverse direction from centralised global to a much more complex and flexible structure which has become known as transnational but quelch's four-stage categorisation is useful all the same when a company goes international it may establish wholly-owned country subsidiaries in its larger more promising markets sometimes acquiring local distributors the company managers needed for these young subsidiaries are traders who focus primarily on sales and distribution to achieve local market penetration the company devolves more functional responsibilities to country managers they develop and manufacture an ever broader line of locally adapted products the company becomes a genuine multinational and country managers evaluated on the profits they deliver become potentates to achieve the benefits of greater integration of its activities on a transnational basis the company reduces the country manager's decision-making authority over research and development purchasing and manufacturing it consolidates these functions in centres of excellence which may be regional or global marketing decision are shifted to the regional level the country manager remains involved but has to be a team player a cabinet member in fully global organisations worldwide divisions or lines-of business dominate the organisation the country manager is now an ambassador since most multinationals are at varying stages of development around the world they need more than one type of country manager a portfolio with different sets of skills quelch argues a european consumer goods company for instance might appoint cabinet members as country managers in an increasingly integrated europe but put traders into asia where markets are growing faster and national socio-economic differences are greater meanwhile the potentates who run the company's operations in latin america where tariff barriers still limit cross-border commerce might still remain in place country managers should become a mixed breed of high-fliers in other words not a cloned race of almost has-beens an edited version of the paper will be published in the next issue of the mckinsey quarterly available at the end of this month
