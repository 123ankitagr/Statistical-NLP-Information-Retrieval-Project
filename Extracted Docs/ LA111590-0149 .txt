I am writing to express my appreciation for Joseph Bell 's excellent editorial on Rep. Dana Rohrabacher ( `` Rohrabacher 's Sin : Self-Righteousness , '' Oct. 26 ) . The congressman 's hypocrisy really stands out when he demands drug tests for his employees but maintains his own right to privacy about his history of drug use . The best feature of Bell 's article was his surprising tact . He did not wish to talk about Rohrabacher 's morally bankrupt past , or his LSD use , or his drug parties , or his . . . you get the picture . Rohrabacher has become his own worst enemy . Through his own preaching and holier-than-thou attitude , he has established an atmosphere of intolerance that will work against him . His shining armor is only a thin shell that hides his hypocrisy and less-than-perfect past . Rohrabacher must stop his `` no comment '' strategy and come clean with his own supporters . But be careful , Congressman . Police chief Daryl Gates ' desired law for the execution of casual drug users has no statute of limitation , and he has been asking questions . . . .
