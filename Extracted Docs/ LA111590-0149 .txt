i am writing to express my appreciation for joseph bell's excellent editorial on rep dana rohrabacher rohrabacher's sin self-righteousness oct 26 the congressman's hypocrisy really stands out when he demands drug tests for his employees but maintains his own right to privacy about his history of drug use the best feature of bell's article was his surprising tact he did not wish to talk about rohrabacher's morally bankrupt past or his lsd use or his drug parties or his you get the picture rohrabacher has become his own worst enemy through his own preaching and holier-than-thou attitude he has established an atmosphere of intolerance that will work against him his shining armor is only a thin shell that hides his hypocrisy and less-than-perfect past rohrabacher must stop his no comment strategy and come clean with his own supporters but be careful congressman police chief daryl gates desired law for the execution of casual drug users has no statute of limitation and he has been asking questions nick popoff seal beach
