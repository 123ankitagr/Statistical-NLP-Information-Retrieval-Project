two new systems for giving unit trusts star ratings are being introduced to britain amid a flurry of criticism london business school professor of finance elroy dimson and peter jeffreys managing director of the widely respected analyst fund research are both vehement critics of the new ratings which are being published by measurement services micropal and morningstar they are worried that the ratings will be treated as best buy labels and could also be used in advertisements to mislead the public dimson says there is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these rankings the star ratings are based on risk-adjusted performance figures these are a more sophisticated version of the conventional performance tables which measure different trusts total return over various periods of time the conventional tables take no account of the fact that some trusts take greater risks than others and that their progress is correspondingly more volatile this volatility can be measured by statistical yardsticks such as the standard deviation both micropal and morningstar have their own methods of adjusting a fund's performance for its risk in very broad terms such adjustments penalise a very risky fund and reward one that is very steady the stars are intended to encapsulate the net risk reward relationship funds with the highest overall score get five stars those with the lowest one but statistics relating to past performance are of little use in predicting how funds will do in future dimson argues that risk-adjusted performance figures have no more predictive power than conventional performance figures advertisements from unit trust groups already use conventional performance figures as part of their sales pitch the attacks on the star ratings took place at a recent ft roundtable others taking part were chris poll and keith sheffield who run uk statistical services micropal and hsw respectively james coursey who is uk editor of morningstar and john cuthbert a freelance fund analyst the roundtable was chaired by barry riley investment editor of the ft edited extracts of the discussion appear below poll the flaw in conventional five-year performance figures is that they have only two common factors what the price was five years ago and what it is today with nothing about what went on in between they do not give you the basis for any sort of qualitative evaluation whatsoever but people are using these figures to draw conclusions and make recommendations at the end of the day what do we all want we want more people investing in stock markets either directly or indirectly through funds and we want to educate the public dimson i don't know who we is poll the unit trust industry dimson but that is a million miles away from where the industry is what the industry does is to make promises of performance in which past performance is extrapolated through to the future they build in part on data drawn from your services making sometimes implicit and sometimes explicit claims of the most outrageous nature about the predictability of their returns they would be outrageous whether they take a price five years ago and a price today or whether they take the period in between they would be outrageous whether they look at returns embracing data in between or embracing volatility poll with commercialism you're never going to stop people making claims sheffield i'm not convinced that historical performance is even a relevant starting point to future performance partly because it fails to take account of the market conditions under which we achieved that performance historical performance tables have been useful in exposing the public to the risks the fact that some funds underperform others dramatically over certain periods of time but you can't form total judgments from the collation of numbers you need a mixture of numbers and qualitative appraisal cuthbert i find this argument bizarre you are saying that you have this historical world and you can't do anything with it in future doesn't this imply that you can't pick good managers or even that there aren't good managers dimson there is no dispute that there is a slight persistence in performance at the bottom end poor performers have slightly more than their fair share of being poor performers in the following period so there is something to be learnt from looking at the data and it is appropriate for individuals to know what's been happening to their unit trust but those are different functions from spotting a money manager who's going to be better than all other money managers cuthbert i think we may be missing something we have a problem relating past performance to future performance but that does not necessarily mean that we have a problem measuring managerial ability and if we can measure managerial ability even though that process does not have predictive content it may still be rational to pick managers who have shown more managerial ability than others in the past sheffield i agree with some of your analysis john but i feel the conclusions take us into dangerous territory the danger is that a good fund manager will be expected to perform well in future riley how should star ratings be used poll what we're trying to say by introducing star ratings is in addition to performance is there another measure that will give an indication of how that fund performs the star rating system says if you've got five it's either an excessive performance and excessive risk or medium performance with medium risk we also spell out what the volatility is separately the star rating goes out as part of a sheet on every fund which gives you a variety of quantitative information but the problem is that if you just put the basic components of the star rating system down the average investor won't understand it we are not trying to say that the star rating system has predictive ability we are just trying to identify the characteristics of different funds coursey it is important to make sure the star rating appears in context we have a statement that the star rating is an introduction not a conclusion if you had a portfolio consisting only of funds with five stars and sold them when the ratings went down to four stars your portfolio would not perform well sheffield do you put your customers the unit trust management groups under any contractual obligation as to how they use your star ratings because the advertisements will appear as you know saying morningstar five-star rating micropal five-star rating do you explain that the star ratings really must be related to other information poll we have a 20-page user guide which spells this out whether this is going to be effective is a different question any star system is open to abuse anything's open to abuse sheffield whatever you say here the star ratings will actually be used if you publish them poll but there is so much information published at the moment that is more misleading five-year performance tables and so on dimson i feel you are all conniving you are on your own side and so you are on your customers side there is no question of there being high levels of predictability in these rankings you need something like 25 years data to conclude that someone has superior capabilities which persist over time one can't say that star ratings based on three-year or five-year performance are not helpful people must have information that tells them what has gone on in the past but the implication that these are good-quality funds to invest in for the future is overstated poll i'm not saying it is predictive i'm saying it is informative riley so should we give up and say there is no connection between the past and the future except for the dud funds poll what we are saying is that there is a balance between risk and reward and there is a relationship the star is not doing any more than encapsulating that relationship dimson i've heard the consumers association explain the same thing they say you look down this column and you can see how long the wash cycle is this one and the number of choices of different temperatures you don't have to look for the best buy but in fact they labelled it the best buy you make it clear your stars aren't the best buy but it's terribly tempting jeffreys you would not dream of producing a star rating system based just on cumulative relative performance and risk-adjusted returns are no more predictive than those that's the killer dimson all my peps are in the gartmore index fund i put my money where my mouth is this article is part of an edited transcript of a discussion which took place at the financial times on october 12
