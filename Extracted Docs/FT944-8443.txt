two new systems giving unit trusts star ratings introduced britain amid flurry criticism london business school professor finance elroy dimson peter jeffreys managing director widely respected analyst fund research vehement critics new ratings published measurement services micropal morningstar they worried ratings treated best buy labels could also used advertisements mislead public dimson says there question high levels predictability rankings the star ratings based riskadjusted performance figures these sophisticated version conventional performance tables measure different trusts total return various periods time the conventional tables take account fact trusts take greater risks others progress correspondingly volatile this volatility measured statistical yardsticks standard deviation both micropal morningstar methods adjusting funds performance risk in broad terms adjustments penalise risky fund reward one steady the stars intended encapsulate net riskreward relationship funds highest overall score get five stars lowest one but statistics relating past performance little use predicting funds future dimson argues riskadjusted performance figures predictive power conventional performance figures advertisements unit trust groups already use conventional performance figures part sales pitch the attacks star ratings took place recent ft roundtable others taking part chris poll keith sheffield run uk statistical services micropal hsw respectively james coursey uk editor morningstar john cuthbert freelance fund analyst the roundtable chaired barry riley investment editor ft edited extracts discussion appear poll the flaw conventional fiveyear performance figures two common factors price five years ago today nothing went they give basis sort qualitative evaluation whatsoever but people using figures draw conclusions make recommendations at end day want we want people investing stock markets either directly indirectly funds and want educate public dimson i dont know poll the unit trust industry dimson but million miles away industry what industry make promises performance past performance extrapolated future they build part data drawn services making sometimes implicit sometimes explicit claims outrageous nature predictability returns they would outrageous whether take price five years ago price today whether take period they would outrageous whether look returns embracing data embracing volatility poll with commercialism youre never going stop people making claims sheffield im convinced historical performance even relevant starting point future performance partly fails take account market conditions achieved performance historical performance tables useful exposing public risks fact funds underperform others dramatically certain periods time but cant form total judgments collation numbers you need mixture numbers qualitative appraisal cuthbert i find argument bizarre you saying historical world cant anything future doesnt imply cant pick good managers even arent good managers dimson there dispute slight persistence performance bottom end poor performers slightly fair share poor performers following period so something learnt looking data and appropriate individuals know whats happening unit trust but different functions spotting money manager whos going better money managers cuthbert i think may missing something we problem relating past performance future performance but necessarily mean problem measuring managerial ability and measure managerial ability even though process predictive content may still rational pick managers shown managerial ability others past sheffield i agree analysis john but i feel conclusions take us dangerous territory the danger good fund manager expected perform well future riley how star ratings used poll what trying say introducing star ratings addition performance another measure give indication fund performs the star rating system says youve got five either excessive performance excessive risk medium performance medium risk we also spell volatility separately the star rating goes part sheet every fund gives variety quantitative information but problem put basic components star rating system average investor wont understand we trying say star rating system predictive ability trying identify characteristics different funds coursey it important make sure star rating appears context we statement star rating introduction conclusion if portfolio consisting funds five stars sold ratings went four stars portfolio would perform well sheffield do put customers unit trust management groups contractual obligation use star ratings because advertisements appear know saying morningstar fivestar rating micropal fivestar rating do explain star ratings really must related information poll we 20page user guide spells whether going effective different question any star system open abuse anythings open abuse sheffield whatever say star ratings actually used publish poll but much information published moment misleading fiveyear performance tables dimson i feel conniving you side customers side there question high levels predictability rankings you need something like 25 years data conclude someone superior capabilities persist time one cant say star ratings based threeyear fiveyear performance helpful people must information tells gone past but implication goodquality funds invest future overstated poll im saying predictive im saying informative riley so give say connection past future except dud funds poll what saying balance risk reward relationship the star encapsulating relationship dimson ive heard consumers association explain thing they say you look column see long wash cycle one number choices different temperatures you dont look best buy but fact labelled best buy you make clear stars arent best buy terribly tempting jeffreys you would dream producing star rating system based cumulative relative performance riskadjusted returns predictive thats killer dimson all peps gartmore index fund i put money mouth this article part edited transcript discussion took place financial
