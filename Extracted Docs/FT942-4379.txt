emperor akihito of japan starts his first imperial visit to the us today with a mixture of friendship and sad wartime memories on his mind the emperor's 17-day tour will end with a poignant reminder of japan's ambiguous feelings over its wartime record in this there is a parallel with germany's uncomfortable complexes over the recent d-day landing celebrations for japan the equivalent will come under the spotlight next year the 50 th anniversary of the end of the pacific war as the normandy surf erases the tracks of europe's d-day celebrations emperor akihito will stop in hawaii on his way home to lay a wreath at the us national memorial cemetery of the pacific the punch bowl the emperor's gesture to the sadness of some in washington falls short of the japanese government's original plan for him to visit the uss arizona memorial in pearl harbour a battleship sunk by the japanese attack on december 7 1941 that idea was dropped because of fierce objections from japanese right-wing politicians and commentators many of whom believe the 1941 attack was unavoidable maybe even justified officially the emperor is so mystically elevated that he must get less involved in temporal affairs than his high profile counterparts in the british or spanish royal families so he politely declined last week to comment on whether or not the pearl harbour attack could be justified beyond saying that the war lay heavy on his heart it is very important to understand historical truths correctly but because of my position i must refrain from touching on this kind of subject he said yet at the same time emperor akihito has deliberately descended just a little closer to earth than his father hirohito a mark of the gradual evolution of the world's oldest unbroken imperial dynasty emperor akihito was the first to ascend the chrysanthemum throne in 1989, as a human symbol of the state rather than a god his father hirohito was born the son of heaven but was obliged by the us occupiers after the war to renounce his divinity as such emperor akihito appears to be trying to play a subtle yet emotive role in shaping japan's attempt publicly to come to terms with its wartime past the prerequisite for success in its campaign to become a fully fledged member of the international community in this the emperor is in tune with a gathering mood of wartime regret in mainstream japan in line with his traditional role of embodying the national spirit former prime minister mr morihiro hosokawa's unprecedentedly explicit apologies over japan's wartime record and the recent re-writing of school textbooks to include more detail of that record are the latest signs of this while feelings of atonement are on the rise there is certainly no common view on war history one of the several areas in which fault lines are appearing in japan's famous consensus there is a dangerous nationalist minority as shown by the recent gun attack against mr hosokawa by a right-wing protestor angered at his wartime apologies the denial two months ago by a justice minister that an infamous wartime atrocity never happened damaged tokyo's increasingly vital asian relations the minister resigned but the suspicions he aroused will be hard to soothe to some the significance of emperor akihito's role as a public figure is ambiguous as shown by the response of mr shintaro ishihara a right-wing member of the opposition liberal democratic party to the aborted pearl harbour visit i have never heard of a us president visiting the memorial hall in hiroshima he said drawing a temporal comparison yet mr ishihara a moment later elevated emperor akihito to semi-divinity the emperor is the only priest king in the world i think it is good for the emperor to be mystical if the emperor is not mystical he will no longer be eternal he argues the emperor has in the first five years of his reign worked hard to contribute as a globe trotting ambassador to japan's temporal interests he has already visited the us twice in his official capacity as crown prince his father made the trip once two years ago emperor akihito became the first japanese emperor to visit china so helping to clear the way for closer economic and diplomatic links at the time he pleased the chinese government by saying he deeply deplored the suffering caused during the japanese occupation he stopped short of apologising earlier this year emperor akihito and empress michiko paid the first imperial visit to the war memorial of iwo jima a small pacific island where many thousands of us and japanese were killed he carefully referred at the time to the dead of both sides akihito hopes that the us visit will as the one to china did bring closer ties of course he refrains from noting that his us tour is most timely just as a growing number of senior tokyo government officials are getting anxious that the strain in trade relations might spill over into political and security relations accordingly the imperial couple have accepted a punishing schedule including 11 cities starting in atlanta today they proceed to washington tomorrow where they will be the guests of honour on monday at the first full state dinner of bill clinton's presidency a protocol compliment that will not be lost on japan's humble emperor
