Women who set up in business are more cautious in their financial forecasting than men but are more likely to achieve their goals . Women expect to achieve an average turnover of Pounds 50,000 in their first year while men expect to reach Pounds 110,000 , according to a survey by NOP Corporate and Financial . The difference can not be entirely attributed to the different sectors which men and women choose to work in because retailing was the most popular sector for both sexes , the researchers said . Men who originally expected their first year turnover to be Pounds 130,000 achieved only Pounds 120,000 in their first 18 months while women who forecast sales of Pounds 45,000 in their first year managed Pounds 75,000 after 18 months .
