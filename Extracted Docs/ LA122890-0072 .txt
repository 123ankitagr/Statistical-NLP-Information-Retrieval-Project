Francis Ford Coppola 's `` The Godfather Part III , '' Kevin Costner 's `` Dances With Wolves '' and such mass-appeal hits as `` Dick Tracy , '' `` Ghost '' and `` Pretty Woman '' led the nominations for the annual Golden Globe Awards for motion pictures announced Thursday morning in Beverly Hills . Although the nominations were widely spread among 32 movies , it was `` Godfather Part III , '' with nods in seven categories , that topped the list . On the television side , NBC 's `` L.A. Law '' led with five nominations , while ABC 's `` Twin Peaks '' -- which was mostly snubbed by the TV industry 's Emmy Awards -- took four . The widely acclaimed `` The Civil War '' received no nominations because there is no documentary category , a Golden Globes spokesman said . And Fox Television 's highly popular `` The Simpsons '' was shut out completely . The Golden Globes are regarded by some in the entertainment industry as a weather vane for the Oscars , even though there are only 86 voting members in the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , the Globes ' governing body . The Golden Globes will be awarded on Jan. 19 , during a telecast by Turner Broadcasting System . ( The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences ' Academy Award nominations are due Feb. 13 and will be presented March 25 . ) The 86 members representing 46 countries , also nominated `` Dances With Wolves '' in six categories , `` GoodFellas '' in five and `` Dick Tracy , '' `` Ghost , '' `` Pretty Woman '' and `` Reversal of Fortune '' in four each . Warner Bros. , which released `` Reversal of Fortune '' and `` GoodFellas , '' led motion picture distribution companies with 12 nominations . Walt Disney Pictures , which released `` Dick Tracy '' and `` Pretty Woman , '' and Paramount Pictures , which released `` Godfather III '' and `` Ghost , '' shared 11 nominations each for a second-place tie . The strong showing by Martin Scorsese 's `` GoodFellas , '' follows its double victory earlier this month among the Los Angeles and New York film critics groups as best picture . That factor , plus the even stronger showings in the Globe contest for best movie drama by `` Godfather III '' and `` Dances With Wolves , '' is sure to draw attention to that Globe category as an Oscar indicator . Also nominated in that category are `` Reversal of Fortune '' and `` Avalon . '' The tightness of the dramatic film competition is further seen in the best-director category . With the exception of Barry Levinson 's work for his personal story of an immigrant family in `` Avalon , '' the four other nominees for best motion picture -- drama all received nominations for their directors : Coppola , Costner , Scorsese and Barbet Schroeder for `` Reversal of Fortune . '' The fifth nominee for best director is Bernardo Bertolucci for `` The Sheltering Sky . '' Coppola 's widely awaited `` Godfather '' sequel to the first two Oscar-winning films , garnered nominations for himself as director and as co-writer of the screenplay with Mario Puzo . Al Pacino , who portrays godfather Michael Corleone , was nominated for best actor , and Andy Garcia , who has won rave reviews for his performance as Corleone 's nephew and godfather successor , was nominated for best supporting actor . The large showing by `` Godfather III '' comes following a special screening that Paramount Pictures set up for members of the foreign press on Dec. 12 in Westwood , hours before the rest of the media was allowed to see the film . Coppola himself attended the foreign press showing . `` Dances With Wolves , '' Costner 's frontier epic about native Americans , earned him nominations for best actor and best director , plus a supporting actress nomination for Mary McDonnell as the Sioux-raised woman who serves as a bridge between Costner and the Indians . Pacino is in the unusual situation of being nominated not only for best actor as the Mafia chieftain , but also in the supporting actor category for his underworld comic role in `` Dick Tracy . '' Besides Pacino and Costner , the other nominees for best actor in a drama are Richard Harris for `` The Field , '' Jeremy Irons for `` Reversal of Fortune '' and Robin Williams for `` Awakenings . '' Williams ' `` Awakenings '' co-star , Robert De Niro , was overlooked . De Niro , also was ignored for his starring role in `` GoodFellas , '' as was another highly praised performance in that film by Ray Liotta . Best actress nominees for a dramatic film are Kathy Bates in `` Misery , '' Anjelica Huston in `` The Grifters , '' Michelle Pfeiffer in `` The Russia House , '' Susan Sarandon in `` White Palace '' and Joanne Woodward for `` Mr. and Mrs . Bridge . '' In the musical or comedy category for best picture , the nominees include some of the biggest grossing films of the year , `` Ghost , '' `` Pretty Woman , '' `` Home Alone '' and `` Dick Tracy , '' as well as the just-released `` Green Card . '' None of the year 's action/tough-guy pictures , such as `` Rocky V , '' `` Total Recall '' or `` Die Hard 2 , '' showed up among the Globe nominations . In the competition for best actor in a musical or comedy , 10-year-old Macaulay Culkin , the besieged kid in `` Home Alone , '' is pitted against such major names as Gerard Depardieu in `` Green Card , '' Johnny Depp in `` Edward Scissorhands , '' Richard Gere in `` Pretty Woman '' and Patrick Swayze in `` Ghost . '' In the television competition , Roseanne Barr , whose top-rated TV series `` Roseanne '' was ignored in the Emmys , was nominated for best actress in a musical or comedy series and her co-star John Goodman also received a nod . In network competition , NBC led with 22 nominations , ABC 19 , CBS 14 and Fox 2 .
