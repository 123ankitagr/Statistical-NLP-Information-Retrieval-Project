Federal regulators said Thursday that they plan to sell the major insurance operation of Irvine-based Lincoln Savings & Loan to a Dallas investment firm . The price was not disclosed . The insurance operation is part of a Lincoln subsidiary that filed for bankruptcy court protection on April 13 , along with Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , and 10 other S & L subsidiaries . Lincoln was seized by regulators the next day . Regulators said they intend to sell Continental Fidelity Insurance Co. and its operating unit , American Founders Life Insurance Co. , to Zlogar & Co. Zlogar had been negotiating with Phoenix-based American Continental to purchase the insurance operation before American Continental filed its Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition . Under the bankruptcy filing , executives at American Continental remain in control of the holding company , but regulators control the Lincoln subsidiaries . The purchase price in the current deal was not revealed , but it is all cash and higher than the value of the cash-and-notes deal that Zlogar had worked out with American Continental , said Al Zlogar , the Dallas firm 's president . The value of the previous deal was a little less than $ 45 million , he said . The deal still must be approved by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Phoenix . `` We 're elated , '' Zlogar said . `` The insurance companies are healthy and rated A-excellent by A.M. Best Co. ( an industry rating firm ) . We intend to maintain that rating or better it . '' The decision to buy the insurance operation , he said , was `` 95 % based on the management of company . '' He said he was `` very impressed '' with current managers , who would remain in place after the purchase and help expand the company . American Founders , with $ 300 million in assets , is licensed in 37 states and operates in 23 . Mark M. Connally , an American Continental spokesman , said it was too early to know if the company would object to the proposed sale .
