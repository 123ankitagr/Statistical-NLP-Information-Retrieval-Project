after almost four postunification years in the fog germanys central bankers finally have a reasonably clear view of the future for interest rates mr hans tietmeyer bundesbank president said so himself in midmay in case nobody noticed directorate colleague mr edgar meister was to be heard within hours repeating his bosss lines at a meeting with foreign journalists in the area of central bank interest rates the horizon is clear for a more extended period he said despite the typically fudgy bubaspeak the expectations of the market and the bundesbank for once appeared to be pretty much in tune uttered shortly after the banks floor discount rate had just been cut further to 45 per cent making three reductions since the start of the year the statements signalled there was no need for any more action on rates for the time being economists agreed noting that with seven months of the year still to run their forecasts of last january that the discount rate would be down to 4 per cent or less by the years end appeared to be rocksure safe bets such harmony is unusual at the best of times that it should have been achieved while the bundesbanks main source of inspiration the m3 measure of growth in money supply was apparently less than useless makes it all the more remarkable for the first four months of this year m3 expanded at an annualised rate of three times the banks midrange target of 5 per cent the bank depends on monetary targeting as an earlywarning system against potential inflation as a rule excess m3 growth today spells price growth tomorrow but instead of holding back mr tietmeyers team has continued the process of salamislicing interest rates which started in september 1992 when the discount rate was 875 per cent as the bank has said repeatedly in accompaniment to its latest rate cuts special factors have been at work in the m3 formula which includes cash in circulation current sight and shortterm deposit accounts monetary growth rates were boosted at the start of the year by government tax inducements which led to a sharp jump in loans for house purchases many of these loans were parked in shortterm accounts while buyers waited to exchange contracts but the most special factor of all was the introduction of a 30 per cent atsource tax on investment income which set in motion a cash carousel money which had poured out of the country to avoid the levy came flooding back in in the latter months of 1993 an estimated dm25bn came in from luxembourg alone its arrival coincided with a period of uncertainty about interest rates which prompted many waitandsee investors to hold the funds in shortterm accounts rather than in longterm instruments which are excluded from the m3 calculation but as bank directors have made clear there is no guarantee that that is the whole story as mr meister said in may when his colleagues had had several months to analyse what was going on it was still not possible to separate the special factors from the inflationary potential which might be stored up in the m3 figures in the light of this lack of transparency the bundesbanks ratecutting actions have been seen in some quarters as foolhardy others have suggested despite protestations to the contrary that the bank is preparing to abandon or relax its controversial dependence on mediumterm monetary targeting probably the most charitable judgment is that mr tietmeyer after some six months into the job as controller of german and european monetary policy is living up to his earlier reputation as an internationallyminded pragmatist with a touch more flexibility than was evident in the makeup of mr helmut schlesinger his predecessor lower german rates have had a welcome and discernible effect on economic recovery prospects both inside and outside germany but as private sector economists point out there are dangers according to mr thomas mayer at goldman sachs the main supporting arguments behind this years rate cuts so far were that inflation was slowing with little upward pressure from either the demand or supply sides and that the aberrations in m3 could be justifiably ignored because they were temporary inflation is falling but the pace is painfully slow and there have been some uncomfortable signs as mr mayer pointed out recently the threemonthly annualised rate of price rises in april was 3 per cent compared with 25 per cent in march as evidenced by frequent mentions in bundesbank directors speeches in the early part of this year this measure of inflation was much in favour at least while it was significantly below the yearonyear rate in more recent statements the bundesbankers have made plain that they hope or expect that recent corrections to the interest rate structure will encourage investors at last to siphon the liquidity currently inflating m3 into longterm capital formation there seem to be few illusions that this will be a rapid process the central bank also appears to hope that general economic conditions and the popular mood tempered by falling real disposable incomes and despite lower interest rates will discourage bank borrowing and further help reduce m3 if investors and borrowers fail to follow the banks pointers if m3 fails to deflate and continues sending blurred signals the question arises of how long mr tietmeyers team can continue ignoring the possibility that inflationary pressure may be mounting undetected the bank faced with calls to scrap its m3 plaster saint and seek guidance by new means has responded with clear and repeated rejections indeed it plans to lobby hard to have monetary targeting adopted by the future european central bank mr meister when asked about the prospects for money growth coming back into line replied when you have a target you must make an effort to achieve it even though the bank probably favours more rate cuts even if they require a longer wait until the view of the horizon improves further mr meisters remark is a reminder that corrective action can not be ruled out however distant the possibility of a rise in german interest rates may seem at present mr tietmeyer will need no reminders that his main responsibility is the bundesbanks reputation not his own
