A town in Sweden has installed a system based on magnetic sensors to help blind and partially-sighted people find their way around . The Hanmyo system , which was developed by NEC , the Japanese group , consists of ferrite particles embedded in paving slabs on a designated route through town . These interact with a magnetic sensor incorporated within the user's white cane , causing the cane to vibrate when it comes in contact with the ferrite pavements . At certain points in the town , the cane activates loudspeakers which provide information on street names and potential hazards . This is the first Hanmyo system to be installed in Europe , although 100 similar systems have already been installed in buildings and streets in Japan . NEC : UK , tel 071 353 4383 ; fax 071 353 4384
