Former Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky , the most popular political leader in postwar Austria , died today , doctors said . He was 79 . Kreisky was hospitalized with a heart condition last week and had been in critical condition , one of his doctors said Saturday . Kreisky dominated Austrian political life for two decades and was chancellor from 1970 to 1983 . He stepped down as chancellor after his Socialist Party failed to win a majority in parliamentary elections . In 1986 , after indecisive elections forced the Socialists to form a government with the Austrian People 's Party , their conservative rivals , Kreisky broke with the party and even renounced his honorary chairmanship . He had lived in virtual seclusion for the last few years , largely because of his health problems . Kreisky had undergone a kidney transplant several years ago . He had received medical treatment for circulatory problems for some time , but his heart condition had `` seriously worsened during the last 24 hours , '' the Austria Press Agency quoted Dr. Wolfgang Enekel as saying Saturday .
