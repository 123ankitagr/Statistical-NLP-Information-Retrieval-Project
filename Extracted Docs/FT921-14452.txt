direct genetic treatment of inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis and haemophilia is to receive official approval today a department of health committee headed by sir cecil clothier former chairman of the police complaints authority has decided that gene therapy can go ahead in the uk subject to certain ethical safeguards the procedure pioneered in the us involves correcting genetic defects by adding new genes to the cells where they are needed it is expected to be more effective and longer-lasting than conventional drugs the treatment approved is somatic gene therapy it corrects the defect by adding new genes to certain cells for example in the bone marrow or lungs but the genetic change is not passed on to the patient's offspring in contrast germ line gene therapy which would affect future generations is regarded as medically unpredictable and ethically unacceptable it will not be approved in the foreseeable future
