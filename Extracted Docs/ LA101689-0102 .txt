Cornel Wilde , who starred in a string of swashbuckling film melodramas and was nominated for an Oscar for his portrayal of Frederic Chopin in `` A Song to Remember , '' died today at 74 , a hospital spokeswoman said . Wilde , who produced , directed and starred in many of his medium-budget films , entered Cedars Sinai Hospital Sept. 2 , for treatment of leukemia and died of the disease , a spokeswoman said . His son , Cornel Wilde Jr. , was at his side when he died . Wilde 's big chance came in 1945 when he played an ailing Chopin in the Technicolor film `` A Song to Remember . '' One film writer said he grew paler and wanner with each reel while fingering an impressive sound track on a mute piano . The pianist off screen was Jose Iturbi .

He was best known for acting in adventure movies including `` The Naked Prey , '' `` High Sierra , '' `` The Bandit of Sherwood Forest , '' `` Beyond Mombasa , '' `` Omar Khayyam , '' `` Constantine and the Cross , '' and `` The Fifth Musketeer . '' The 1955 movie `` The Big Combo , '' which he produced and starred in , was criticized at the time for being too violent . `` You ca n't get away from violence in drama , '' was his reply . `` If you do not have conflict , you do not have drama . If a brutal scene is shown for no reason except to shock , then it is bad . '' He also acted in , directed and produced `` Devil 's Hairpin , '' `` Maracaibo , '' `` Sword of Lancelot , '' and `` Shark 's Treasure . '' His last movie was `` My Very Wilde Life , '' filmed in 1987 . Born in New York City on Oct. 13 , 1915 , Wilde married actress Patricia Knight in 1938 .
