MANCHESTER SHIP Canal yesterday reported a 63 per cent rise , from Pounds 4.79m to Pounds 7.81m , in interim pre-tax profits after exceptional credits totalling Pounds 3.05m . Turnover for the first half of 1992 was flat at Pounds 10.5m , but operating profit improved 21 per cent to Pounds 3.17m ( Pounds 2.63m ) . Earnings per share were 182.5p ( 152.8p ) , but a decision on whether to pay a dividend will depend on the full year results , Mr Robert Hough , chairman , said yesterday . A dividend of 4.5p was paid last year . Exceptionals included Pounds 2.43m from Heywoods , the ship canal 's container terminal operator - in effect a transfer fee from Ellesmere Port to Seaforth in Mersey Docks , where Heywoods will start operating later this year . Since Heywoods will take Ellesmere Port 's specialised cranes with it , the ship canal will handle no more containers . However , Mr Hough said container traffic accounted for only Pounds 644,000 of turnover ; most turnover came from bulk chemicals and liquids and the basic customer base was 'secure ' , he said . Another Pounds 800,000 of exceptionals came from Massey Ferguson , the Varity-owned farm machinery manufacturer , to buy the ship canal 's rights to first option on land in Trafford Park , where Massey Ferguson has been reorganising . The ship canal 's long term worry , however , is its property portfolio in and around Salford Quays , the Port of Manchester 's former disused docklands , where it has about 200,000 sq ft of new office space unlet . The company says this is worth Pounds 2m a year in rental , which prices it at only Pounds 10 per sq ft , compared with Pounds 15-Pounds 20 for lesser accommodation in Manchester city centre . 'Since we have only 6 per cent gearing , I believe we can take a long-term view of this , ' Mr Hough said , although letting is 'an immediate priority . '
