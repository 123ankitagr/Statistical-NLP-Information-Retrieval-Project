the ambitions of microsoft know no bounds not content to dominate the market for software run on stand-alone pcs the world's largest software company now aims to extend its reach into workgroup computing we are seeing the world evolve from islands of information on individual workstations to groups of people collaborating on shared information says bill gates microsoft chairman and chief executive he aims to put microsoft in the forefront of this pc evolution with a rush of new products over the next six to nine months the pc remains at the centre of gates's world but his strategy reflects the view that networked pcs will eventually take over the traditional role of minicomputers and even mainframe computers in corporate computing workgroup computing is emerging as a way to use pcs to enhance office productivity instead of only speeding up the ability of individuals to write memos or calculate budgets workgroup software enables teams of people to collaborate on projects more efficiently the first step in microsoft's grand plan will emerge later this month with the introduction of windows for workgroups a new version of microsoft's popular windows that incorporates networking programs enabling each member of a group to share information send electronic mail and schedule group meetings by incorporating basic workgroup functions into its windows operating system microsoft aims to expand the market for workgroup computing and encourage more pc users to link their machines to networks currently only about 30 per cent of microsoft windows users are linked to networks but this is just the beginning microsoft says its next move will be to launch a database program that simplifies the development of applications such as order entry and inventory tracking these programs will set the stage for windows nt microsoft's next-generation operating system now expected some time in the first half of 1993 this the most ambitious of microsoft's efforts is designed to provide pc-like ease of use on company-wide computer network systems yet all of this comes from a company which despite its successes has so far lagged behind competitors in providing software that links pcs on networks and in applications geared to more than one user neither does microsoft have any experience beyond pc software which however important it may be lacks the maturity of programs developed for larger systems microsoft faces a boatload of competitors acknowledges steve ballmer executive vice president of sales and support he lists apple computer which already provides networking and workgroup software borland with its database programs and lotus development with its notes program for workgroup communications ibm and sun microsystems are also competitors the immediate obstacle to microsoft's ambitions however is novell which commands a 60 per cent share of the market for network operating systems to date microsoft is running a poor second to novell in the networking software stakes none the less microsoft's vision is compelling by extending the familiar easy-to-use features of windows and not forcing pc users to adapt to new applications programs microsoft can provide a relatively painless path from personal computing to workgroup or company-wide computing it is a scheme that will have great appeal for growing companies and for a generation of computer users whose experience is based upon the personal computer we view workgroup computing as an evolutionary process says ballmer users should be able to use the applications and operating systems they are familiar with and be able to pick and choose the elements they need for their particular workgroup microsoft also stresses the openness of its approach including connectivity to systems running other operating systems and gateways to existing mainframe or minicomputer based systems hewlett-packard and digital equipment have been close partners with microsoft throughout its development process the company says however with its fuselage of promises it appears that microsoft's ultimate goal may be to become as ibm was in the 1970 s and early 1980 s the software standards setter of the 1990 s the question will be whether computer users and manufacturers are ready to accept microsoft in that role
