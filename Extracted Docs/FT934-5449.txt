intrigued by glowing accounts of rich information resources and lured by the promise of a free international electronic mail service computer users are signing up in droves to services that offer access to the internet a global web of computer networks already the internet links thousands of computers and an estimated 15m computer users one million new subscribers a month are said to be hooking up their computers to the net public awareness of the internet has been raised in part by the clinton administrations promotion of the national information infrastructure as a development that will bring broad economic and social benefits to all americans the internet is the precursor of the highspeed information superhighway system it provides free access to thousands of computer databases the opportunity to engage in a myriad of online debates or special interest group discussions and the ability to exchange electronic messages with other users almost anywhere in the world at little or no cost from its genesis in a 1969 us defence department project to provide computer links between researchers at us universities and national laboratories the internet has grown into a vast web of public and private computer networks about half of which are in the us although it lacks the speed and bandwidth of future information superhighways the internet demonstrates the potential value of data communications as well as some of the challenges that lie ahead on the information superhighways by creating digital links to distant information resources for example the internet is beginning to eliminate the constraints that geography places on access to education jobs and services students can now access nasa leave messages for the astronauts browse around in libraries larger than they will ever be able to visit read world and national news that appears in newspapers that are not available in their small towns change the way they feel about the size of their world a teacher from a small texas school district writes in the national information infrastructure agenda for action a report by clintons information infrastructure task force iitf businesses are taking advantage of the vast libraries of research reports available on the internet small companies that can not afford private computer networks can use the internet to link distant sites software developers and insurance companies are using the internet to shift labourintensive programming and data processing jobs to lowcost regions of the world the growing use of the internet also points to an urgent need for higher capacity information highways already there are data traffic jams on the internet as millions of new users explore its resources new highspeed data channels are essential if the whole system is not to become gridlocked widening the roads of the internet may not however be sufficient to provide broad public access to information resources indeed the history of the internet would suggest that it may encourage even more traffic the establishment in the 1980s of the national science foundation network which provided a highspeed backbone for the internet spurred a vast increase in its use the entire information infrastructure bridges linking different networks and on and off ramps providing access to individual computers will have to be upgraded if there is to be universal access to information resources as the clinton administration is insisting the shortcomings of the internet also raise questions about the design of information superhighways despite its rising popularity the internet can be fully exploited only by people with a significant degree of computer expertise to be accessible to a broader spectrum of society information superhighways will have to be far easier to use this will require the development of interface software that hides the complexity of the network from its users the lack of any central control over the internet has enabled it to grow rapidly as thousands of regional and local area computer networks have plugged in however the flexibility of the internet also makes it far more complex there is for example no catalogue of resources on the internet the internet is therefore difficult to use unless you know exactly what you are looking for and where to find it similarly the internet lacks the equivalent of a telephone directory to send messages to another internet user you have to know their internet address but there is nowhere to look it up data security is another weakness as numerous security violations have shown however ensuring data privacy may prove difficult the thorny question of the rights of law enforcement officials to snoop on the data highway has also to be addressed access to vast amounts of information is not the whole answer the power to discover the right information quickly and easily to separate nice to know from need to know information is essential if information superhighway users do not drown in electronic junk info perhaps the most critical issues raised by the internet relate to intellectual property rights on the internet anybody can copy any material whether it be a newspaper article or a graduate thesis without charge essentially this means an individual who posts information on the internet forfeits rights of ownership the iitf is currently evaluating the need for a system that enables information providers to collect royalties for copyrighted products delivered or made available through information superhighways the clinton administration has acknowledged that unlike the internet the information superhighways of the future will be built and controlled by the private sector however the government will have a critical role to play in determining that all americans have universal service at affordable prices and in writing the rules of the road commercially owned governmentregulated highspeed information networks will be capable of delivering a myriad of services ranging from interactive television and online shopping to videoconferencing and information services akin to those of the internet ironically however while newcomers to telecomputing may welcome such developments veteran internet navigators fear commercialisation and regulation will doom the freewheeling spirit that has enabled the internet to thrive published by addison wesley a pocketsized guide with plenty
