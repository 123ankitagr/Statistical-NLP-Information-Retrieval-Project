Actress Ann Jillian , who underwent a double mastectomy for breast cancer in 1985 , says humor is a great defense when battling a serious illness . `` A sense of humor as well as faith in God and the support of the ones you love , that 's what will get you through an experience like that , '' she said . Jillian will speak about her experience with cancer Saturday as part of an anniversary celebration of Highland Hospital 's Breast Care Center . Jillian , a volunteer for the American Cancer Society , said she is n't shy about discussing cancer . `` Cancer is n't a word that should be whispered . It is n't a subject that should be hushed up , '' she said .
