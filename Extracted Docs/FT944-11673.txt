Brierley Investments yesterday paid more than NZDollars 243m ( USDollars 150m ) for a 26.45 per cent shareholding in Wilson and Horton , publisher of New Zealand 's biggest circulation paper , the Auckland-based New Zealand Herald . Brierley , founded by New Zealand corporate predator Sir Ron Brierley , advised the stock exchange before trading began yesterday that it had bought a 19.9 per cent stake overnight and was standing in the market for a further 5 per cent at NZDollars 9.50 a share . This was NZDollars 1.50 above the previous day 's close . The extra shares were bought within minutes . Subsequently , Brierley bought another smaller stake . Directors of Wilson and Horton complained they had no prior notice of Brierley 's intentions . They reminded shareholders of the statement in the latest half-yearly profits report that the group was trading buoyantly , and benefits were expected soon from new presses and printing technology . They said the offer price was well below the Dollars 11.10 the shares reached in January . The New Zealand Herald , which frequently produces 120-page editions , has a circulation of 245,000 , about three times larger than any other New Zealand daily . Wilson and Horton also owns provincial newspapers and magazines with strong sales . It has long been viewed as a takeover target , as it is the only newspaper group in Australia or New Zealand that does not have a shareholding by an international publishing group , and no leading shareholder . It has also been considered an under-performer . Brierley Investments has no other media interests . Wilson and Horton shares closed NZDollars 1.25 higher at NZDollars 9.50 , and Brierley shares rose 2 cents to NZDollars 1.25 .
