Prime Minister Herbert Blaize was ousted as leader of Grenada 's ruling New National Party during a party convention vote and replaced by his longtime critic , Keith Mitchell , the minister of communications and works . The election of Mitchell means he will be the prime minister of the Caribbean island nation if the centrist party wins in elections due by December . Mitchell , 43 , has regularly criticized Blaize for making major decisions without consulting his Cabinet . Blaize 's ouster as party leader -- a position he has held since 1960 -- was apparently due to a drop in popularity and ill health . The 71-year-old Blaize , who became prime minister in 1984 , has prostate cancer .
