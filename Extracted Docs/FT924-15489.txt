Renault and Volvo are to develop jointly a new range of top-of-the-line executive cars to be sold in Europe from the end of the decade . The joint car project marks a significant step forward for the two vehicle makers , which have been developing a far-reaching alliance since September 1990 . Renault said yesterday the two groups had decided to develop a common platform for the new range of executive cars , which would allow the use of many common components , most importantly common engines and gearboxes . While having a high degree of commonality 'under the skin ' , the cars would have different body styles and would maintain independent Volvo and Renault brand identities for sale through their separate distribution networks . It is expected that the Renault version would replace its new generation Renault Safrane executive car , launched this year in Europe to replace the Renault 25 . According to Renault the new joint car range would replace the present Volvo 850 , which has been launched by the Swedish car maker during the last 12 months . The joint Renault/Volvo car project is taking a similar approach to that already used by the Peugeot group for its Peugeot and Citroen marques . Its current top-of-the-range Citroen XM and Peugeot 605 cars share a common platform , engines and gearboxes , but maintain very separate identities in the market .
