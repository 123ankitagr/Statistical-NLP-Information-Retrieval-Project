mr hans tietmeyer the bundesbank president yesterday reinforced expectations that german interest rates could fall again in the autumn by saying that growth in money supply was lower than unadjusted figures suggest and that inflation was heading in the right direction mr tietmeyer speaking after a mid-year review of the bank's m3 measure of money supply indicated that the german central bank was relying less than usual for policy guidance on its volatile m3 indicator the distinction between money which could potentially fuel inflation the normal m3 constituents and funds invested for the long-term had become less clear he said but the bundesbank would not give up m3 he stressed it was a part of germany's stability culture experience showed the link between the measure and future inflation to be intact while yesterday's review of alternatives had shown them to be second-best solutions he said a review of possible modifications to presentation and interpretation would continue until december when the 1995 m3 growth target was due to be fixed meanwhile trends in public spending policy wage agreements and near-term inflation were important factors guiding policy he suggested as long as other sources make us confident that future price developments are moving in the right direction deviations from the m3 target path can to some extent be tolerated he said the consumer price index currently rising at 3 per cent was on the right track and there were signs of further flattening he said recent increases in raw materials prices were being countered by the relative strength of the d-mark against the us dollar he added although a statement from the bank warned that lingering excess liquidity in the m3 figure would cause concern mr tietmeyer claimed the measure had been growing at an adjusted annual rate of around 6 per cent for the last three months this is close to the bank's target range of 4-6 per cent which has been exceeded so far this year the unadjusted m3 growth rate for june released earlier this week was 11.3 per cent the bank's decision yesterday to fix the interest rate for securities repurchase agreements at 4.85 per cent for the four weeks of the summer break was not a signal to other countries mr tietmeyer said mr johann wilhelm gaddum vice-president said the fixed repo rate was in line with market rates and expectations see lex currencies page 27 world stocks page 33
