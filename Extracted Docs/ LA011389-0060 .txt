Ray Blair , San Diego city manager until he retired in 1985 , will run the city of Escondido until a permanent city manager is chosen . Blair replaces Vern Hazen , who resigned last week under pressure from the slow-growth majority on the Escondido City Council . Blair was chosen after a council executive session Wednesday night . Escondido will pay Blair $ 5,000 a month as interim manager , and he will start work this weekend , attending a workshop on growth management in Laguna Beach with council members Carla DeDominicis and Jerry Harmon , and top Escondido staffers . Blair , 63 , operates a private management consulting firm in San Diego . He served as San Diego city manager from 1978 until his retirement and had been a deputy city manager and assistant city manager in San Diego since 1969 . Hazen will remain as a consultant with the city of Escondido , drawing his $ 95,000-a-year salary , until his employment contract ends in August . Escondido Mayor Doris Thurston said that Blair will not be a candidate for the permanent city manager 's post . The council plans to hire an executive-search firm to conduct a nationwide search for the city 's next permanent city administrator . Blair said he has been offered other chances to serve as interim city manager but has turned them down . He said he called Escondido officials to apply for the post when he heard of the vacancy .
