The Docklands Light Railway in London is to resume evening services on October 3 for the first time in five years . This follows the completion of the first stage of a Pounds 46m modernisation of its automatic train control system . The railway , which links the Canary Wharf office development with the City , has shut in the evenings and at weekends to allow installation and testing of the new system . Weekend services will resume next spring . The recently-opened eastern extension of the railway to Beckton will remain closed in the evenings until mid 1995 .
