this will be the last of these columns for a while i am being catapulted forward in time to join the monday ft so hawks handsaws is going into storage together with its best-loved character miss lee my executive assistant i broke the news to her on thursday in a restaurant near chelsea barracks a place so fashionable that the bill for two people is always pounds 130, whatever they eat or drink during the past four years miss lee has established a place of great affection in readers hearts last christmas she received more cards than i did she has been invited to numerous functions and to address school prize-days miss lee's popularity has been based on the fact that she appeals equally to men and women women like her because she is a thatcherite yorkshirewoman of immense poise and style who speaks her mind plainly wears stupendously expensive clothes and exhibits minimal tolerance of male fears and foibles strange to relate men seem to like her for exactly the same reasons but now she is headed for storage when i told miss lee in the restaurant that she and hawks handsaws were going into the cold store there was an instant sprinkling of tears and a dabbing of ivory cheeks but that was just the waiters miss lee remained composed well michael she said i suppose there are elements of the readership that will miss your pensees creuses but remember pietra mossa non fa muschio a rolling stone gathers no moss or indeed gravitas there were signs just lately that your saturday morning drolleries were acquiring some shape the first suggestion of weight in particular you seemed to have dropped your campaign against john major and the conservative party and to have switched your eyeless gaze towards a far more deserving target boy-scout blair and his new-model labour party when tony blair comes to power if he comes to power we shall know whom to blame whippersnappers like you whiffling in the wind fomenting unrest unable to see that john major is all that stands between us and the bottomless pit i said if that is only half true i reckon we should jump why is it miss lee that conservative-minded souls nurse the belief that they know what's best the only hate-mail hawks handsaws has received has been from far-right conservatives anonymous and scurrilous penned in mauve ink what produces this hatred dislike of namby-pambiness i said that's not much of a reason as for john major whenever i see his name i think of what the american writer wendell berry said from our point of view said berry the difference between the mind of a human being and that of a mountain goat is wonderful from the point of view of the infinite ignorance that surrounds us the difference is not impressive miss lee said any more pick-of-the pensees from four years of column-writing well i said gamely relishing her tartness which is about to go into storage not long ago i had lunch with another ft columnist this was most unusual on austere newspapers such fraternising is rare columnists eye each other cagily and pass by on the other side however i and this person were having lunch and i said that i often regretted that in a column of 720 words it was hard to do justice to complicated subjects like human over-population which is killing the planet that all you could do was make a few points without really getting round to formulating solutions and this guy said he is really extremely bright that columnists weren't there to provide reams of analysis or draw up legislation but to lob a few well-directed grenades into the seething mess of human affairs and hope for the best i could see that he was right but then i thought as a species we have analysed everything that is wrong with us we know all about our mistakes yet we are making more and more of them the faster we lob grenades the faster they come back at us we are rushing towards our end miss lee of that i am quite convinced miss lee smiled brilliantly and signalled to a waiter michael she said gently you are speaking for yourself
