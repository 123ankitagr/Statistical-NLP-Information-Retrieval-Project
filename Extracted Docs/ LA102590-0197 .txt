For the fourth time in the 23-year history of its Image Awards , the National Assn . for the Advancement of Colored People said Wednesday that it was unable to field a category of best actress in a motion picture because there were too few candidates . `` This appalling situation again highlights the imbalance and irresponsibility of the film industry , '' said Sandra Evers-Manly , president of the organization 's Beverly Hills/Hollywood branch . The chapter presents the Image Awards , which honor positive portrayals of blacks in movies , television and music . `` The industry has yet to show diversity or present realistic leading roles for African-American women , '' she said . At a news conference to announce this year 's Image nominees , Evers-Manly said that the NAACP has been meeting with the six major Hollywood studios this year , and believes that changes will be made to improve opportunities for minority actresses .
