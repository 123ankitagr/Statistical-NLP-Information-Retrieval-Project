Forest fire smoke from four summers ago in the Tahoe Basin greatly stimulated algae growth in the lake , longtime Tahoe researcher Charles Goldman said . Nutrients in the smoke particles probably caused the increase in algae production , he said . He plans follow-up research on possible links between wood smoke and declining clarity of the lake 's water . The California Air Resources board recently adopted a rule to remove inefficient wood stoves at the time of home sales and to speed up enforcement of federal stove emission standards taking effect in 1992 .
