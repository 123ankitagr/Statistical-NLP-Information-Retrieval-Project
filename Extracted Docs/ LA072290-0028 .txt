Ho hum . . so Times pop critic Robert Hilburn suggests that rock is dead or dying ( July 15 cover story , `` Is Rock Running on Empty ? '' ) . Have n't we heard that before ? Critics have been periodically writing rock 's obituary since 1959 -- despite that rock has continued to grow in popularity and today has its largest worldwide following ever . Hilburn tends to overlook that from a creative standpoint rock is cyclic and at the present we are going through a stagnant period . Do n't worry , Bobby , they 'll write your obituary decades before they 'll write rock 's ( and I am assuming you 'll live to at least 100 ) . JAY CHARLES JOHNSON La Crescenta
