conscious of the weight of history bearing down on him japans emperor akihito carefully delivers each of his prescripted public words punctuating the sentences with uncomfortably long silences and filtering the emotion from a voice still ascribed supernatural qualities his tones will be more carefully measured than usual when he arrives in china tomorrow for the first visit by a japanese emperor the humble akihito has made clear a sense of deep privilege that his reign should be chosen for this journey the emperors most obvious task will be to deal with the relatively recent past the invasion of china during the 1930s and 1940s by delivering an unambiguous apology and perhaps clearing the way for an era in which the economic potential of the relationship will finally overcome the bitter memories for the communist party leaders who invited the emperor the sixday visit has a less lofty more immediate purpose they are still in the process of convincing the chinese people that the regime has the respect of the international community and any foreign dignitary has been much appreciated since the tiananmen crackdown of 1989 in these circumstances a visit by the emperor is all the more welcome the chinese government is also keen to attract japanese investment a controversial issue during the early 1980s when the revolutionary elders drew comparisons between japanese joint ventures in northern china and the occupation of manchuria in the 1930s an occupation begun in the name of the then emperor hirohito father of akihito it is a sign of the changed times that six leading trading houses including mitsubishi corp and mitsui co yesterday announced a plan to build a dollars 4bn petrochemical complex in the northern chinese province of liaoning japanese trading houses are also developing an industrial park in the northern city of dalian and a japanese trucking company has announced plans for a transportation network in the north in the year of the akihito visit the 20th anniversary of the restoration of sinojapanese relations china will become japans secondlargest trading partner behind the us and up from fifth place a year ago japanese investment in china which rose from dollars 349m in 1990 to dollars 579m last year is likely to double this year as manufacturers bruised by falling profits source more of their components in lowcost and increasingly reliable china the emperor is certain to laud this developing bilateral economic relationship but the flow of funds and an apology from the emperor are not likely to appease a chinese people raised on horrific tales of the burn all loot all kill all policies of the japanese military during the second world war detailing the brutality of that period has served the communist partys interests as it highlights the heroic role of revolutionaryera soldiers one of whom deng xiaoping is now an emperor himself in everything but name in deference to the japanese emperor beijing has barred protests by private groups seeking war compensation from japan and taken much newspaper space to explain the new nonpolitical role of akihito japans foreign ministry is also emphasising the nonpolitical role of the emperor as enshrined in the constitution and arguing that the event is nothing more than a goodwill visit this interpretation is questioned by some sceptical members of the ruling liberal democratic party evidence of the relationships rich and complex history is shown in the varied opposition from left right and middleground groups in tokyo there are complaints that the timing of the visit violates the emperors nonpolitical status and about the flattering of a discredited chinese leadership then there is concern that the exalted japanese emperor is travelling to pay tribute even at the height of chinese influence over the past two millennia during which japan imported a written language and the essence of its spiritual and philosophic beliefs no emperor crossed the sea to beijing
