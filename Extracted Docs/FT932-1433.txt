long-distance road hauliers in germany yesterday issued an angry condemnation of the move to deregulate the european community road haulage market and warned that it would unleash ruinous price competition in a statement issued three days after the agreement reached by ec transport ministers in luxembourg the german national federation of road hauliers said much cheaper road transport charges would lead to a big switch in goods from rail to road transport with serious environmental consequences the hauliers are concerned that the agreement will lead to intense price competition in germany where the market is dominated by small and medium-sized businesses which could be undercut by larger and more efficient european operators the long-distance road hauliers said that the tax burden on german operators would almost certainly be aggravated the luxembourg agreement aims at the effective deregulation of the ec road haulage market by 1998, with any ec operator allowed to tender for business in other member states in exchange germany the benelux countries and denmark have agreed to introduce a regional vignette tax disc for cross-border lorries to help equalise the tax burden between them
