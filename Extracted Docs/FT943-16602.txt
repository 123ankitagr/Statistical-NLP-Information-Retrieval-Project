Representatives of more than 30 leading brand manufacturers will tomorrow formalise a campaign group to press for legislation curbing supermarkets' 'lookalike ' brands , Neil Buckley writes . The British Producers and Brand Owners Group , set up earlier this year , failed to get clauses included in the Trademarks Bill to strengthen restrictions on lookalikes - own-label products designed to resemble well-known brands . The main aim of the group , which includes Unilever , Mars and Nestle , will be to persuade the government to introduce legislation . It may also investigate the possibility of taking action against supermarkets under European Union law . Own-label products account for more than 50 per cent of sales by volume in supermarket chains . Brand manufacturers want legislation to stop supermarkets not only infringing registered trademarks , but copying the overall look of branded goods , including the colour and shape of packaging .
