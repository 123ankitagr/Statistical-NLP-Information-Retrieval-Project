Cable News Network plans live broadcasts of most events during Nelson R. Mandela 's visit to eight U.S. cities beginning this week , but other networks will limit most coverage to regular news programs . CNN spokesman John Bianchi said CNN will report live on the South African black nationalist leader 's June 20-July 1 visits to New York , Boston , Washington , Atlanta , Miami , Detroit , Los Angeles and Oakland . He said separate scheduled events involving Winnie Mandela will be taped for showing on regular news programs . Mandela is to be guest at a special `` Town Meeting '' to be taped Thursday at City College of New York for broadcast that evening on ABC , and will also appear on the network that night as a guest on Ted Koppel 's `` Nightline . '' ABC was undecided about further live coverage as of Monday noon , spokesman Arnot Walker said . CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said CBS will cover the Mandela visit `` if news warrants '' but planned no prior announcement . NBC plans regular coverage and is undecided whether to cover live the African leader 's scheduled address to a joint session of Congress next week , said network spokeswoman Catherine McQuay . His arrival in New York on Wednesday will be broadcast live on the NBC `` Today '' show , she said . Mandela is scheduled for two appearances Friday on PBS , a live 15-minute interview with co-host Robert MacNeil on `` The MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour '' at 7 p.m. and an interview with Charlayne Hunter-Gault , taped earlier that day for showing at 10 p.m .
