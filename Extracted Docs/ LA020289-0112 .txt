The City Council has eliminated restrictions on how much the city can invest in two types of short-term investments . By a 5-0 vote last week , the City Council removed $ 500,000 limits on city investments in repurchase agreements , which are money market accounts backed by bonds , and on banker 's acceptances , money market accounts based on letters of credit issued by a bank . Dennis Danner , the city 's director of finance , said he proposed the change because the former policy was too restrictive . Under the old policy , said Danner , the city in early January had a difficult time temporarily investing nearly $ 7 million it withdrew from its investment portfolio to pay a legal settlement . While waiting for attorneys to reach an agreement , the city had to hold the money for three days before forwarding it to the recipient , Southern Pacific Transportation Co. During those three days , the city was unable to invest in repurchase agreements or banker 's acceptances because of the dollar limits , and certificates of deposits were unavailable because sufficient collateral could not be obtained from qualified institutions , said Danner . As a result , the city lost about $ 1,500 a day in interest , he said . The amended investment policy approved last week also expanded the number of banks in which the city may invest , from the top five to the top six in California . The change would allow the city to invest with Sanwa Bank , where the city has its main account .
