only when the genevan dust has settled and the details of the uruguay round agreement are finally available will developing countries be able to assess whether they have granted more trade concessions on the gatt's conventional mercantilist calculus than they have gained in return late last month the gatt secretariat produced a report which appeared to suggest that developing countries had made substantially greater trade concessions than their developed country partners but trade sources in geneva report however that new tariff reduction offers were arriving right up to the round deadline and that the final outcome is likely to be significantly more liberal mr balkrishan zutshi india's ambassador to the gatt is less sure he certainly believes that his country has given more than it got he says that india has cut its average trade-weighted tariff for non-consumer industrial goods by 55 per cent albeit from a high base while the european union cut its average tariff to india by 22 per cent and the us by 18 per cent as far as market access is concerned there is a feeling that developing countries have put in more than they've got in return he says in new delhi indian deputies paralysed parliament yesterday in protest over new delhi's endorsement of the trade deal but agreed that there was little they could do to reverse the decision the ambassador's sentiment seems to be borne out by early gatt estimates using figures based on offers made up to november 19, the secretariat estimates that the percentage of developing country industrial exports now subject to tariff bindings has risen from 21 per cent to 65 per cent while agricultural tariff binding has risen even more dramatically from 17 per cent to 89 per cent as a result of the round developed country binding percentages remain higher but the increases are much less dramatic in return developing countries appear to have got less in return than richer countries from developed country liberalisation the average trade-weighted tariff on industrial imports to developed countries has fallen based on provisional gatt figures by 38 per cent as a result of the deal but average tariffs on imports from developing countries have fallen 32 per cent while the tariff on least-developed country imports has fallen by just 19 per cent and remains some two-thirds higher than that on developed country imports one reason for these rather dramatic figures gatt officials explain is developed country barriers to textile trade embodied in the multi-fibre arrangement now due to be phased out over the next ten years when the effective tariff rates implied by mfa quotas are included or textile and fish imports excluded the picture for developing countries looks considerably better moreover gatt officials point out simple comparisons of tariff cuts fail to appreciate the benefits to developing countries of the accord the strengthening of the rules-based world trading regime and the domestic gains from cutting national trade barriers a recent oecd study of the welfare effects of liberalisation estimates non-oecd countries would gain dollars 29.9 m if oecd countries alone cut their trade barriers but dollars 86.4 bn if non-oecd countries also liberalise indeed the most dramatic change during the uruguay round has been the switch in the attitude of developing countries including india from opposing reductions in trade barriers to unilaterally cutting their own tariff barriers in order to foster export-led growth ironically it has been developed countries which have dragged their feet over making the concessions necessary to reach agreement back in 1986 we had two superpowers the berlin wall developing counties had not embraced the process of autonomous liberalisation and industrialised countries were not in recession says mr balkrishan zutshi the uruguay round has been completed in a very different world
