The murder trial of the man charged in the Westwood slaying of Karen Toshima began Monday with Los Angeles Superior Court Judge James Albracht denying a defense bid to move the trial somewhere else . After reviewing newspaper clipings and videotaped accounts of television coverage , Albracht , who is presiding over the case in Santa Monica , ruled against the defense request for a change of venue , calling news coverage of the case `` most routine . '' The coverage should not prevent court from finding an unbiased jury , he said . There is `` nothing unique about this case , '' Albracht said , citing other high-profile cases that have been tried in Los Angeles County , including the Night Stalker and Charles Manson murder trials . Paul Takakjian , attorney for defendant Durrell D. Collins , 23 , had argued that publicity surrounding this case was so great , long-lasting and divisive -- pitting South-Central Los Angeles residents against the rest of the city -- that jurors might feel compelled to convict Collins to `` smooth over '' the problem . Testimony is expected to begin this week .
