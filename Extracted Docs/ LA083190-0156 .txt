There is no evidence that radiation emissions during the 1979 nuclear accident at Three Mile Island affected the health of area residents , an independent study released today concludes . The study by Columbia University scientists said there was no sign that the radiation caused leukemia or childhood cancer among people living within 10 miles of the plant . Those illnesses are more sensitive to low-level radiation than other diseases and are the first to appear after exposure , the scientists said in a briefing several miles from the nuclear plant near Harrisburg . The findings were published today in the American Journal of Epidemiology . They match the conclusions of a 1985 report , released by the state Health Department , that found no evidence of increased cancer in a 20-mile radius . In the latest study , Columbia epidemiologists Mervyn Susser and Maureen Hatch studied the health records of 160,000 residents of 69 areas within the 10-mile radius . They also compared cancer rates between 1975 and 1985 .
