THE AUSTRALIAN government yesterday protested strongly against the US authorities ' decision to extend its 'export enhancement ' subsidy programme for barley to China , a key export market for Australian growers . The barley programme has been set at 3.375m tonnes , allocated across 14 countries and regions , and will be effective until September next year . Two of the countries - China , allocated 100,000 of malting barley , and Romania - were not previously eligible for EEP subsidies on barley . 'The inclusion of China , Australia 's most important market for malting barley , is a particularly unhappy development , ' said Mr Gareth Evans , the Australian Foreign Affairs minister , and Mr Michael Lee , acting minister for Primary Industries and Energy in a joint statement . Australia shipped some 400,000 tonnes of malting barley to China in 1992-93 , about half its export total .
