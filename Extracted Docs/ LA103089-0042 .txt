Tailback Bo Jackson of the Raiders took a pitch from quarterback Steve Beuerlein and sprinted around left end . Linebacker Greg Manusky wrapped his arms around Jackson , but Jackson eluded him and cut back across the field . `` Bo made a nice cut , '' Manusky said . `` I got an arm on him and I tried to wrap it around him and he broke through . '' Jackson also broke another tackle on the way to a 73-yard touchdown run in the Raiders ' 37-24 win over the Washington Redskins Sunday at the Coliseum . Strong safety Alvin Walton hit Jackson on the hip , but Jackson bounced off and ran for the end zone . Bo ran 10 yards out of the end zone and flipped the ball over his shoulder in celebration . `` There 's nothing better than a run like that , '' Jackson said . `` I felt ( Manusky ) right on my heels and at the last minute I cut back across the field and I knew that he was n't going to catch me . If I would have run straight like I ran the last leg I knew he would have caught me . '' Quarterback Steve Beuerlein , who watched the play unfold , marveled at Jackson 's ability to escape the Redskin defenders . `` Once Bo gets a head of steam going these guys do n't seem to realize that you ca n't hit him high and expect him to go down , '' Beuerlein said . `` The only way you can get him down is to go at his legs . If you do n't get his legs I do n't think there 's anyone that has the speed to catch him . '' Nobody caught Jackson Sunday . After rushing for a total of 164 yards in his first two games , Jackson made his first start and gained 144 yards in 19 carries against Washington . It was the second time in his three-year National Football League career that he has rushed for more than 100 yards . `` Bo Jackson was no surprise , '' Washington Coach Joe Gibbs said . `` He broke that run at the beginning of the third quarter and that was really a big play . '' Indeed . Jackson seemed to get stronger as the game wore on , rushing for 118 yards in the second half . `` You could say that I get more fired up as the game goes on , '' Jackson said . `` The whole team is like a locomotive . We start off slow and just pick up speed and momentum and everything just goes with it . '' With the crowd chanting , `` Bo , Bo , Bo , '' Jackson had a 45-yard touchdown run nullified by a holding penalty in the fourth quarter . Was Jackson disappointed that the touchdown run was nullfied ? `` Nope , '' Jackson said . `` If it was a play deciding the outcome of the game I probably would have been disappointed . But we had a comfortable lead . It was just one of those things that happen . '' Like any smart running back , Jackson praised his offensive line . `` The offensive line blocked their . . . off today and I hope they do it again next week , '' Jackson said . `` If they give me holes like I got this afternoon you can bet the farm that I 'm going to do everything I can to score . '' Raider guard Steve Wisniewski does n't think Jackson needs many blocks to break a long run . `` It 's kind of pointless to chase after him because I know I 'm not going to make any type of block for him , '' Wisniewski said . `` You make a block and you just stop and look at him . That run was sweet . I just had my mouth open just watching him run down the field . '' After joining the Raiders three weeks ago , Jackson has rushed for 308 yards in three games , an average of 102.6 yards per game , and is on a pace that would give him his first 1,000-yard season as a pro . Although NFL defensive coordinators have designed defenses to stop Jackson , Bo knows how to break the big play . `` Anybody 's capable of breaking a big play , '' Jackson said . `` When a team is keying on our running game it opens up the passing game and when they key on the running game it opens up the passing game . '' The Raiders have flourished since Jackson joined the team . After starting the season with a 2-3 record , the Raiders are 2-1 since Jackson reported . The Raiders , who averaged 121.8 yards rushing in their first five games , are averaging 157.3 yards on the ground since Jackson joined the team . Has he made the difference ? `` I 'm just one of the 11 guys out there playing , '' Jackson said . `` If the team plays better when I 'm out there , that 's great . But I do n't think that 's the case . We want to get back to the old Raiders and let all of this talk die that the Raiders are getting soft . ''
