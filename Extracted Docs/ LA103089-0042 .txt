tailback bo jackson of the raiders took a pitch from quarterback steve beuerlein and sprinted around left end linebacker greg manusky wrapped his arms around jackson but jackson eluded him and cut back across the field bo made a nice cut manusky said i got an arm on him and i tried to wrap it around him and he broke through jackson also broke another tackle on the way to a 73yard touchdown run in the raiders 3724 win over the washington redskins sunday at the coliseum strong safety alvin walton hit jackson on the hip but jackson bounced off and ran for the end zone bo ran 10 yards out of the end zone and flipped the ball over his shoulder in celebration theres nothing better than a run like that jackson said i felt manusky right on my heels and at the last minute i cut back across the field and i knew that he wasnt going to catch me if i would have run straight like i ran the last leg i knew he would have caught me quarterback steve beuerlein who watched the play unfold marveled at jacksons ability to escape the redskin defenders once bo gets a head of steam going these guys dont seem to realize that you cant hit him high and expect him to go down beuerlein said the only way you can get him down is to go at his legs if you dont get his legs i dont think theres anyone that has the speed to catch him nobody caught jackson sunday after rushing for a total of 164 yards in his first two games jackson made his first start and gained 144 yards in 19 carries against washington it was the second time in his threeyear national football league career that he has rushed for more than 100 yards bo jackson was no surprise washington coach joe gibbs said he broke that run at the beginning of the third quarter and that was really a big play indeed jackson seemed to get stronger as the game wore on rushing for 118 yards in the second half you could say that i get more fired up as the game goes on jackson said the whole team is like a locomotive we start off slow and just pick up speed and momentum and everything just goes with it with the crowd chanting bo bo bo jackson had a 45yard touchdown run nullified by a holding penalty in the fourth quarter was jackson disappointed that the touchdown run was nullfied nope jackson said if it was a play deciding the outcome of the game i probably would have been disappointed but we had a comfortable lead it was just one of those things that happen like any smart running back jackson praised his offensive line the offensive line blocked their off today and i hope they do it again next week jackson said if they give me holes like i got this afternoon you can bet the farm that im going to do everything i can to score raider guard steve wisniewski doesnt think jackson needs many blocks to break a long run its kind of pointless to chase after him because i know im not going to make any type of block for him wisniewski said you make a block and you just stop and look at him that run was sweet i just had my mouth open just watching him run down the field after joining the raiders three weeks ago jackson has rushed for 308 yards in three games an average of 1026 yards per game and is on a pace that would give him his first 1000yard season as a pro although nfl defensive coordinators have designed defenses to stop jackson bo knows how to break the big play anybodys capable of breaking a big play jackson said when a team is keying on our running game it opens up the passing game and when they key on the running game it opens up the passing game the raiders have flourished since jackson joined the team after starting the season with a 23 record the raiders are 21 since jackson reported the raiders who averaged 1218 yards rushing in their first five games are averaging 1573 yards on the ground since jackson joined the team has he made the difference im just one of the 11 guys out there playing jackson said if the team plays better when im out there thats great but i dont think thats the case we want to get back to the old raiders and let all of this talk die that the raiders are getting soft
