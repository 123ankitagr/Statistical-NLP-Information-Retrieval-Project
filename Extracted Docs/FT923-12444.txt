A hardy herbaceous perennial with delightful flower heads , each like a tiny Victorian posy made for a doll 's house . It is composed of a central domed cluster of very small white flowers surrounded by a flat collar of pointed white bracts . In a slightly moist soil and a sunnyor partly shaded place it will spread rapidly by self-sown seedlings . There is a fine purplish red form named Rubra which needs to be increased by division as seedlings are likely to prove variable in colour . Where it is grown among white astrantias many seedlings are likely to appear more or less pink . There is also a variety named Sunningdale Variegated in which the deeply-divided leaves are heavily splashed with cream .
