Washington Mayor Marion Barry , grappling with a record murder rate , proposed legislation to mandate a five-year prison term for anyone caught carrying an unregistered handgun . The law , if passed by the City Council , would toughen the city 's handgun control law , which is already among the nation 's strictest . In the first 58 days of the year , 88 people had been murdered in Washington . Now , a first-time offender caught with an unregistered handgun is charged with a misdemeanor punishable by at most one year behind bars . City law now makes gun possession a felony on second offense . Barry proposed making it a felony for anyone to carry an unregistered handgun .
