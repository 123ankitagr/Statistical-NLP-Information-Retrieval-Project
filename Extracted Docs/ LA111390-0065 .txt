the new mother studied the petalpink baby sleeping beside her i call him my little miracle baby pam baird said as she gazed at 8weekold nathan miracle indeed baird learned she had breast cancer not long after she learned she was pregnant a nationally known oncologist urged an immediate abortion then chemotherapy as her best chance to survive but after consulting more than a dozen specialists and a hospital ethics committee baird like a growing number of pregnant women with cancer decided to try to beat the disease and keep her baby after a mastectomy she began an aggressive course of chemotherapy every few weeks for most of her pregnancy baird reported to the breast care center in orange for injections of three anticancer drugs sometimes the powerful toxins made her vomit sometimes her blond curls fell out in handfuls and sometimes scared for her baby and whether she would live to raise him all she could do was cry but once a month at the obstetricians office baird was reassured by a blackandwhite ultrasound image that showed a normal baby curled tightly inside her in august about five weeks early baird 35 delivered a healthy 5pound 4ounce boy and this week after finishing her last chemotherapy treatment she and her husband rodger celebrated with champagne bairds cancer is in remission her current oncologist david margileth said adding heres a breast cancer patient i feel optimistic about heres a woman i think will be around to raise her baby cancer is rare in pregnancy a spokeswoman from the national cancer institute estimated that a malignancy occurs once in a thousand pregnancies breast cancer occurs once in every 3500 pregnancies cancer occurs in 36 out of 1000 people in the general population but when it does occur it raises deep emotional and ethical questions for patients and their doctors should the mothertobe have an abortion can she afford to delay cancer treatment until her baby is mature enough for delivery will the baby be harmed by chemotherapy and will the mother live to care for her child twenty years ago obstetricians and oncologists say the standard recommendation when breast cancer occurred during pregnancy was an immediate abortion followed by mastectomy radiation or chemotherapy in the past an abortion had been recommended because the physician was uncomfortable about doing the treatments necessary for the mother for fear of injuring the fetus said dr frankie ann holmes an assistant professor of medical oncology at md anderson cancer center in houston today some doctors still advocate abortion but many others including holmes are convinced that you dont have to terminate radiation therapy is still considered harmful to the baby during all stages of pregnancy and diagnostic abdominal xrays have been associated with a high risk of leukemia after birth and other malignancies some doctors report but chemotherapy is a different story anticancer drugs can harm a baby during the first trimester when the heart lungs and other organs are developing medical articles have reported but many of the same drugs can be used safely in the second and third trimester holmes other oncologists and obstetricians have reported at the houston center for instance four breast cancer patients who had chemotherapy during pregnancy gave birth to normal babies this year holmes said still some doctors admit they are uncomfortable when it comes to treating a pregnant woman for cancer everybody kind of wrings their hands a little bit said dr robert dillman director of the hoag cancer center in newport beach you really would like to get the fetus out margileth said that as bairds pregnancy continued during the chemotherapy i tossed and turned about this are we doing the right thing margileth said he was also concerned that the normally happy experience of pregnancy had become a troubling one because of the cancer heres this nice 3to4month pregnant person that you just wish was shopping at south coast plaza for maternity clothes rather than getting adriamcyin a chemotherapy agent margileth said another concern there is little data showing the longterm effects of chemotherapy on the child doctors say they simply dont know if the children will develop major problems later such as infertility or leukemia we worry said dr gerald gilchrist chairman of pediatrics at the mayo clinic in rochester minn and of the american academy of pediatrics section on hematology and oncology he added i dont think anyone knows baird noticed a lump in her right breast late last january shortly after she had weaned her first son rory now 17 months not long after that a home pregnancy test and then a visit to orange obstetrician peter anzaldo confirmed she was pregnant anzaldo suggested that the breast lump might be caused by a clogged milk duct baird said but sent her to the breast center for a more detailed exam a biopsy revealed a large cancerous tumor and in march as baird entered her second trimester she had a mastectomy that surgery showed her cancer had spread invading one lymph node thus the debate began in earnest should baird abort should she continue her pregnancy and have chemotherapy baird wasnt sure what to do i had a 10monthold son i didnt want to die of breast cancer and leave him without a mother but i didnt want to have an abortion margileth began researching the issue reading journal articles and contacting experts around the country when his first contact a renowned breast cancer specialist emphatically recommended abortion baird spent a sleepless week in tears but margileth continued his inquiries finding many oncologists who thought baird could continue her pregnancy and start chemotherapy in the second trimester meanwhile bairds family and friends did their own research her brother a medical student sent copies of the few nationally reported studies on cancer in pregnancy a friend an oncology nurse talked to experts at the national institutes of health her mother who was also being treated for breast cancer talked to doctors and her husband rodger an environmental chemist asked the national cancer institute for a list of reports on pregnant women with cancer then wrote to their authors asking how the babies had fared the three doctors who responded offered good news the babies were normal exulted korean obstetrician doo sang kim the bottom line is the baby is now 4 years and 5 months old and very healthy dr thomas g day jr director of gynecologic oncology at the james graham brown cancer center in louisville ky wrote i would like to reassure you that if chemotherapy is started after 12 to 14 weeks it is probably safe the bairds took one more step at anzaldos suggestion they asked st joseph health systems perinatal bioethics committee to review their case a 25member committee that included doctors a geneticist a social worker and a priest listened as anzaldo presented diverse opinions on what to do the committee provided a forum for the issues but no recommendation still rodger baird called the meeting cathartic they didnt have any lectures for us i spent half the time asking technical questions of the geneticist but when it ended the bairds had come to a conclusion three days later in her 15th week of pregnancy pam baird received her first dose of chemotherapy the first time i had it i just cried she recalled it was scary to know she was pregnant and yet three powerful toxic drugs adriamycin cytoxan and an agent called 5 fu were coursing through her veins although she became nauseated and her hair fell out the treatments never seemed to affect the baby baird said each month i just relied on dr anzaldo that everything was all right at each visit he took a sonogram and i could see the baby move nathan trilling baird was born prematurely by cesarean section after bairds amniotic fluid began leaking in the eighth month of her pregnancy anzaldo does not believe the anticancer drugs caused the premature birth or affected the baby the bairds are thankful and still a little amazed that chemotherapy didnt hurt their son these are really nasty compounds rodger baird said but the babys definitely healthy as for pam baird she is busy caring for cuddly nathan as well as trying to keep track of rory an active toddler and she has some suggestions for other women who might find themselves pregnant and diagnosed with cancer dont just rely on one doctor she advised take the initiative to research it dont just go on blind faith the bairds recently wrote to the three cancer specialists they had heard from thanking them for their responses and reporting that mother and baby were fine and pam baird said she was considering sending one more letter and a picture of nathan to the prominent breast cancer specialist who had urged an abortion the note will be brief baird said this is the baby we wouldnt have had
