Robert Evans , British Gas chairman , has unveiled a wide-ranging shake-up of the company 's management , three months after he split the roles of chairman and chief executive and appointed Cedric Brown to the latter position . Evans says the changes were a natural consequence of Brown 's move to chief executive , and adds that they are aimed at introducing more effective and up-to-date management structures . ' A clear separation of strategy and implementation is being introduced , where the corporate centre provides the strategic direction of the company , with responsibility for implementation being devolved as far down the line as possible , ' he says . BG explains that the changes would allow the central bureaucracy to be reduced , with more responsibility passing to the heads of individual business units . Norman Blacker ( left ) moves from managing director of regional services to become managing director , gas business , responsible for BG 's gas business in the UK . Ron Probert , the current managing director of gas supply and strategy , becomes managing director , business development , responsible for planning , construction , research and technology . He is also expected to keep his responsibility for overseeing BG 's response to the Monopolies and Mergers Committee inquiry into the UK gas market . Probert announced his intention to retire from BG 's board in June 1993 when the MMC inquiry ends . Russell Herbert ( right ) , managing director , corporate services , is appointed a BG director and becomes managing director of Global Gas , the international gas supply and services division . George Langshaw moves from his post at the head of Global Gas to become managing director of UK regions . Arthur Dove becomes managing director , regional services , while Dennis Cottrell is appointed to the new post of director of corporate resources .
