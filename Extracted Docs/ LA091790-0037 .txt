The head of security for deposed Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega on Sunday abandoned Panama 's Vatican Embassy , where he had taken refuge after last December 's U.S. invasion , and immediately went into hiding , Panamanian officials said . The escape of Eliecer Gaytan , who was Noriega 's chief bodyguard , prompted a full-scale manhunt by U.S. and Panamanian authorities , a local radio station said . Television news reports showed the embassy ringed by American troops and Panamanian police . Gaytan took refuge on Dec. 23 in the Vatican Embassy , joining Noriega , who later handed himself over to U.S. authorities to stand trial in Florida on drug-related charges . Gaytan remained for the next nine months .
