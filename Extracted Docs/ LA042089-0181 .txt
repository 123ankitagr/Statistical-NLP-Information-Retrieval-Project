Saying the city faces tough decisions in the coming year , Abbe Land was sworn in as mayor Monday . Land , who easily won reelection last year to a four-year term on the City Council , replaces Councilwoman Helen Albert in the largely ceremonial role as mayor . The position is rotated annually among the five council members . Councilman Paul Koretz , the newest member of the council who was elected last year , was appointed mayor pro tem . Land cited parking , a city transit study , a proposed garbage collection system and expected budgetary constraints as among the difficult issues the city faces in the coming year . `` This year , our fifth year ( of cityhood ) , promises to be one in which we have a lot of decisions regarding a lot of different things that we 've been working on for the last five years , '' she said . Land , who has enjoyed support from the politically influential Coalition for Economic Survival , a renters ' rights group , was first elected to the council in 1986 to fill the unexpired term of former Mayor Valerie Terrigno , who resigned after being convicted of embezzlement .
