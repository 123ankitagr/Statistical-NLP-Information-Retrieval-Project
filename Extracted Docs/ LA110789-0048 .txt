A suit by the federal government asks that a Yugoslav ship that ran aground and destroyed coral beds be condemned and sold in order to pay penalties for damaging the marine ecosystem . The suit claims the freighter Mavro Vetranic was not seaworthy and its crew incompetent when it plowed into a fragile coral reef in the Florida Keys on Oct. 30 . U.S. marshals seized the ship when it arrived at the Port of Miami .
