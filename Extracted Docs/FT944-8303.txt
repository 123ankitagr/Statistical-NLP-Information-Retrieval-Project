california's netscape communications has tens of thousands of eager customers for its first product a navigator for the global internet which is not surprising because this silicon valley software start-up company is handing out free copies of its mosaic computer program to anyone who asks that might seem an odd way to go about building a new business but jim clark chairman and co-founder of netscape has his eye on a prize far bigger than the revenues he may be sacrificing today he believes that giving away the beta version of the mosaic navigator will help garner support for netscape's much more ambitious plans to transform the internet a global network of millions of computers from a playground for computer enthusiasts into the primary route for electronic commerce until earlier this year clark was an internet sceptic as chairman of silicon graphics a leading manufacturer of computer work-stations he founded in 1982, he had been pursuing interactive television as the future path for the information superhighway then he met marc andreesen a 23-year-old cyber-star computer science graduate andreesen created mosaic a software program that enables even computer novices to explore the internet's vast resources since andreesen and a group of fellow students working at the university of illinois national center for supercomputing applications launched mosaic on to the internet last year it has been used by an estimated 2 m people i realised that mosaic on the internet was the way to create all sorts of interactive multimedia services says clark while the television industry is moving slowly toward interactive multimedia services the internet is spawning more and more sophisticated applications every day clark resigned from silicon graphics and formed netscape last april hiring andreesen and half a dozen other former students from the university of illinois to get the venture off the ground starting from scratch clark claims the team created a faster more robust version of mosaic as well as a netsite program for businesses that want to create interactive services on the internet like the original mosaic netscape's software provides internet users with a relatively simple way to find information using hypertext linking between different documents and databases by clicking on a highlighted word in a hypertext document you are automatically transferred to related material which might be stored in the same computer data base or in another one half a world away were you to read this article via the internet for example there would probably be opportunities to refer back to other ft articles about the internet you might also be able to click on the word mosaic to access the nasc internet server or pick netscape to download the company's free software or switch to silicon graphics internet server and read about its products when you click on a hyperlink you initiate a process says clark today that is typically the retrieval of a document a movie or an audio recording the internet is essentially a set of standards communications protocols that define how data is moved from one computer to another says clark the internet is going to be the de facto standard for all kinds of interactive multimedia services just as the establishment of technology standards spawned the personal computer revolution clark sees these internet standards as likely to create vast opportunities in interactive multimedia services those companies that are writing applications today are going to be best poised for the opportunity to create interactive digital businesses in the future however there are several technical barriers that must be overcome before the internet is ready for the mass market today the infrastructure of the internet is primitive says clark standard telephone line access is too slow to deliver video and it takes several minutes just to retrieve a colour picture but as telephone and cable tv companies upgrade their networks the internet will become faster and more versatile he predicts partnerships with telephone companies are a central element of netscape's plans to bring the internet to a bigger audience by early next year there will be several telecommunications companies announcing that they provide internet-related services says clark i call it internet dialtone it will become one of the basic services that phone companies offer security is another problem on the internet today there is no way of ensuring that sensitive information such as credit card numbers can be protected from computer hackers a serious impediment to electronic commerce however using advanced encryption technology from rsa data security a leader in the field netscape has created a secure version of its software which it aims to sell to companies that want to do business on the internet the ability to track and bill internet users is another essential element of netscape's plan to help usher in electronic commerce for electronic publishers one of the most important things is building in the ability to track subscribers in order to attract advertisers says clark we believe that advertising is an absolutely fundamental part of this the biggest barrier that netscape faces however is persuading businesses to ply their wares in the electronic marketplace handing out free software that draws tens of thousands of potential consumers to the internet is merely the first step
