The City Council on Monday hired a headhunting firm to find a city attorney to replace Joseph Pannone , who resigned this month to join a private law firm . The council appropriated $ 19,000 for Norman Roberts & Associates to find Pannone 's successor . The firm , recommended by the city staff , was cited for its experience and knowledge of Culver City . Pannone has been the city attorney since 1986 . His resignation will be effective Nov. 17 .
