Things are really starting to look up for Kelvin MacKenzie , the legendary former editor of The Sun . An admirer of Lady Thatcher and all that she stood for , MacKenzie 's departure from News Corporation via the BSkyB satellite company left him without any big pay-offs or share options . Fortunately , he has ended up at the Mirror Group which , despite its left-leaning stance , knows how to motivate its heavy hitters . MacKenzie has been showered with 155,038 share options at 129p which means that he is already sitting on a Pounds 24,000 paper profit . Even so , how Kelvin must envy David Montgomery , his new boss and former chief sub on The Sun . Not only is Montgomery younger than MacKenzie , but his entry in Who 's Who is more than five times as big and he has 10 times as many share options at less than half the price . Should have jumped ship earlier , Kelvin .
