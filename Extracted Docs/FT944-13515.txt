things are really starting to look up for kelvin mackenzie the legendary former editor of the sun an admirer of lady thatcher and all that she stood for mackenzie's departure from news corporation via the bskyb satellite company left him without any big pay-offs or share options fortunately he has ended up at the mirror group which despite its left-leaning stance knows how to motivate its heavy hitters mackenzie has been showered with 155,038 share options at 129 p which means that he is already sitting on a pounds 24,000 paper profit even so how kelvin must envy david montgomery his new boss and former chief sub on the sun not only is montgomery younger than mackenzie but his entry in who's who is more than five times as big and he has 10 times as many share options at less than half the price should have jumped ship earlier kelvin
