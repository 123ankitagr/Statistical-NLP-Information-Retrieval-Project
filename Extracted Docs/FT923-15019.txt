sir you report on june 30 pension age for women may rise that the government is moving in favour of equalising the state pension age at 65 a flexible decade of retirement has apparently been ruled out you discuss the options solely in terms of benefits or losses to the exchequer this is precisely a reflection of the narrowness of government thinking the state pension age is critical in influencing individuals retirement decisions a fixed state pension age encourages employees to think in terms of an arbitrary and absolute end to their working lives this is at odds with the trend in working patterns where flexibility is paramount a flexible decade of retirement would allow and encourage employees actively to think about a range of options rather than perpetuating the damaging belief that full-time work should end at 65 trudy coe head of external policy british institute of management 2 savoy court strand london wc2r 0 ez
