Everyone loves Lucy -- including video companies , two of whom are releasing collections of classic moments from the late Lucille Ball 's TV shows . CBS/Fox has just released the second batch of shows from its `` I Love Lucy Collection . '' Priced at $ 14.98 , Volumes 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 contain two programs each from the most enduringly popular TV series ever . Here 's the rundown : Volume 5 -- `` Lucy and Bob Hope '' ( 1956 ) and `` Lucy and Superman '' ( 1957 ) . Volume 6 -- `` Pioneer Woman '' ( 1952 ) , in which Lucy and Ethel try to cope without modern appliances , and `` The Camping Trip '' ( 1953 ) . Volume 7 -- `` Never Do Business With Friends '' ( 1953 ) and `` The Courtroom '' ( 1952 ) , two shows with the usually friendly Ricardos and Mertzes battling it out for a change . The ferocity of their war in `` The Courtroom '' will probably startle fans who have n't seen this episode before . Volume 8 -- `` The Ballet '' ( 1952 ) , another variation on the most typical `` Lucy '' plot , where she tries to break into show business , and `` The Handcuffs , '' a wild till-key-do-us-part episode . Meanwhile , Goodtimes has just put out `` A Tribute to Lucy '' and `` Lucy 's Lost Episodes , '' two compilation tapes that run 80 minutes each yet cost only $ 9.95 each . `` Tribute '' documents Ball 's life and career and includes never-aired scenes from her post- '' I Love Lucy '' series `` The Lucy Show . '' `` Lost Episodes '' features highlights from `` I Love Lucy , '' `` The Lucy Show , '' `` The Lucy/Desi Comedy Hour '' and `` Here 's Lucy '' and Ball 's appearances on other shows , such as `` Toast of the Town , '' `` What 's My Line '' and `` The Bob Hope Show . '' Otherwise , it 's a slow week at the video store , with no notable new movies . Pop-music fans , however , can choose from these : '' Paul McCartney : Put It There '' ( PMV , $ 24.95 ) , a 65-minute video version of a documentary seen recently on Showtime cable . `` Indigo Girls : Live at the Uptown Lounge '' ( CMV , $ 19.98 ) , 69 minutes of singing by the new , folky female duo .
