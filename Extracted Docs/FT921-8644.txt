YUGOSLAV Vice-President Branko Kostic has said he would never allow the Yugoslav army to withdraw from the republic of Bosnia-Herzegovina while he remained a member of the federal presidency , Reuter reports from Belgrade . His comments will alarm the ethnically-mixed republic which is due to hold a referendum on independence on February 29 and March 1 . Bosnia-Herzegovina has a mixed population of Moslems , Serbs and Croats . Its politicians fear that fighting between Croat militias and Serb irregulars backed by the Yugoslav army could spill over into their republic .
