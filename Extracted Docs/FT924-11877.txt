METROLINK , the operators of Greater Manchester 's Pounds 130m tram system , said yesterday it expected to submit plans to the government this year to expand the network to Oldham and Rochdale . Mr Chris Mulligan , director-general of Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive said if approved , the local-authority-backed scheme could see light railways from Manchester to the two towns operating next year or in 1994 . Discussions were also under way about possible extensions to Salford Quays , Trafford Park and Manchester airport . Manchester 's bid for the 2000 Olympics meant another possible extension , to the city 's east , where a cycling velodrome and Olympic stadium are planned . Mr Chelvin Hibbert , Metrolink chief executive , said more than 3m people had used the service between Bury , Manchester city centre and Altrincham since it began six months ago . Metrolink says the electric trams , which run on rail lines and the streets , have boosted retail shopping . Up to 20 other British towns and cities might use similar systems , with Sheffield due to begin services next in 1993 , the operators said .
