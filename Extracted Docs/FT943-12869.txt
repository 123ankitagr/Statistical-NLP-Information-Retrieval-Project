sir we here disturbed to read the report by emma tucker and john ridding on air frances bid for further state aid brussels set to back state aid for ailing air france july 21 the further propping up of this carrier will do as much harm to air transport users as it will to competitor airlines under pressure from the french government air france is flying routes that are not economically viable given its cost structure this not only undermines the profitability of current competitors but also deters the emergence of new lowcost airlines it is vital that the commission requires air france to make big cuts in capacity in markets which are not overshadowed by a statesupported carrier we are now witnessing a significant number of new services often provided by new regional airlines these carriers must be able to establish themselves now as air travel growth resumes if they are to stand any chance of longerterm survival the provision of more state aid can only hinder them and will for the foreseeable future deny users the full benefits of liberalisation john parr director general air transport users council 5th floor kingsway house 103 kingsway london wc2b 6qx
