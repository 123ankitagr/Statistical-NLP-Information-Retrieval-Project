caribbean rum producers have asked the european union to increase the quota for rum they can ship duty free and then to abolish the quota to end a shortage of the product in europe a senior official of the european commission said the rum quota would be increased by previously agreed levels next year and the possibility of abolishing the quota would be studied the producers say they need more immediate action to end what they say is the disruption of the market the rum producers part of the african caribbean and pacific acp group of countries have criticised the eu for being slow to honour legal commitments to react by increasing the access for rum to meet the growing demand they say this is written into the lome convention a trade and aid treaty between the eu and the acp the current quota stands at 220,000 hectolitres a year following a 20,000 hectolitres increase to the extent that the consumption of rum increases significantly in the union the union undertakes to carry out a new examination of the annual rate of increase fixed by this protocol says the convention officials from the rum producing countries say that what is seen by many as the commission's foot-dragging is the result of pressure from france which wants to protect its domestic rum industry in martinique and guadeloupe its two caribbean departments rum is the only industrial product covered by the lome convention which is subject to quotas says mr yesu persaud chairman of the caribbean association of industry and commerce because of the quota system the caribbean rum industry is now experiencing serious disruption because the demand for rum in the union has been growing rapidly mr peter pooley director general of the development directorate of the european commission has assured rum producers that the automatic quota increase of 20,000 hectolitres will be effected next year in february 1994 we will begin work a report on dismantling the rum quota he said one caribbean official describes this as cold comfort to an industry that had a market begging for the product but which is being obstructed for reasons known only to themselves by the eu before the lome convention was agreed rum from what are now the acp states entered europe unrestricted there were no quotas although the product was subject to duty with the first lome agreement france insisted on a quota for the quantity of rum that could be imported duty free and this was written into the current agreement demand for rum in europe has been expanding steadily since 1989 when the eu legislated on the definition of rum establishing that it had to be made from sugar cane this destroyed a lucrative market for several other spirits which had been marketed in europe as rum and also drove counterfeiters out of the market this growth has continued and is now outstripping the quota we have says mr patrick mayers chairman of the west indies rum and spirit producers association the quota was exhausted at the end of the quota year which ended in june and will soon be for the current year mr mayers says many european importers and distributors have told their caribbean suppliers to ensure that the problems of the last quota year are not repeated as they would not be able to handle shipments which exceeded the quota such imports attract a punitive duty which makes the product too expensive to be sold says mr mayers the automatic increase of 20,000 hectolitres which they will get next year is considered by the producers insufficient to resolve the problem they say that the rate of growth of demand for rum in the eu will soon outstrip the increased quota and that the situation will become tighter when new members join the union the european market brings the caribbean producers about dollars 20 m pounds 13 m a year and these earnings could increase significantly if access were to be improved says mr mayers rum producers fear that a continued shortage of the product will lead european consumers to turn to other liquor leaving rum a difficult task in regaining market share if and when access for the product is increased either through higher quotas or an abolition of the quota
