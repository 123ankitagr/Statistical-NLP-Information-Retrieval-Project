Re Lynne Heffley 's July 5 article on KCAL ( `` Asian and Latino groups are outraged by two characters in the revived 'Dick Tracy ' cartoon series '' ) : It 's a shame that people spend so much time hunting for ethnic stereotypes . Would n't the time be better spent teaching their children not to hate or hurt ? My 12-year-old son has a neurological disorder known as Tourette 's Syndrome . This is a disease ( not a form of retardation ) that is controlled by medication . His teacher has made a valiant effort to educate his classmates ( and their parents ) about his disorder . But still my son has to cry himself to sleep over one word : retard . I was raised with violent and ethnically stereotyped cartoons , but I had one advantage . I was raised with a conscience . All parents have to do is teach their children the difference between right and wrong . Then we would n't need stereotype hunters anymore . SHERRI MENDOZA West Covina KCAL on July 6 decided to discontinue broadcasting the `` Dick Tracy '' cartoon .
