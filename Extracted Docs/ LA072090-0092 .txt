the city went all out for richard m nixon library festivities thursday displaying banners and signs everywhere in town but one banner was prepared by someone who could have been a dropout from the current first ladys literacy campaign welcome noxin the sign proclaimed it stayed up on the side of a building just long enough to be spotted by a few photographers then an embarrassed worker realized the error and whisked the banner away on a day so carefully planned so heavy with speeches and ceremony so full of presidents current and former there were bound to be occasions that werent on the program here are just a few of them while most of the dedications events were on time not everything ran like clockwork when master of ceremonies and show biz veteran johnny grant told the audience to welcome dr and mrs norman vincent peale to the stage he turned around with a flourish only to find an empty stage ive been told that when youre in trouble you can always turn to the marines grant said and thats what im doing the marine corps band from el toro in the best show business tradition unhesitatingly filled the void by playing an unscheduled number when the four presidents were supposed to come to the platform there was another delay as more music was played to fill the gap a new york times reporter joked in the press gallery i bet i know whats causing the delay i bet jerry ford is lost another reporter wondered aloud whether the delay would amount to an 18 12minute gap referring to the notorious erased portion of one of nixons watergate tapes it came close 17 minutes journalists did more than quip they also contributed to the long lines stretching as far as the eye could see that the public had to stand in before going through a metal detector outside the library grounds entrance one of the networks cbs caused problems when staffers left their television truck parked near the library locked and unoccupied that made the secret service nervous fearing that the truck contained something more ominous than a transmitter for nearly an hour the line didnt move while security agents searched for the party with the key gene la blonds rv got a thorough goingover when he parked it across the street from the library la blond from la habra used the oversize vehicle to provide a birds eye view of the ceremony to friends who climbed to the roof and watched the festivities with binoculars the fbi came and went through it this morning with a finetooth comb but outside of that we havent had any trouble at all la blond said the only problem is you cant get more than eight up there at a time otherwise the roof will fall nixon supporters came in all ages pattye byrd 15 a sophomore at troy high school in fullerton who was among students gathered at a nearby church at 1 am to fill the 50000 red white and blue balloons that were released after the speeches noted that she and her classmates were not born when nixon resigned in 1974 but many are supporters of the former president just cuz he got caught doesnt mean hes bad pattye said the ceremony was topheavy with bigname republicans but one politician was conspicuously absent us sen and gop gubernatorial candidate pete wilson was he ducking the event after calculating that an appearance with nixon would hurt his campaign not so aides said he had tickets he wanted to come out campaign spokesman bill livingstone said sudden changes in the senate schedule kept wilson in washington livingstone explained indeed the senate had been expected to spend thursday working on a major civil rights bill but the measure unexpectedly passed late wednesday night and thursday morning the senators moved to the 1990 farm bill a piece of legislation with potentially major impact on california agriculture it would have been nice to have been there said livingstone although frankly with four presidents there it would be a little hard to get into the limelight gayle wilson subbed for her husband at the dedication good old american capitalism reigned outside the dedication ceremonies tshirts and buttons were hawked after the event muffins sweet rolls and parking spaces were on sale before greg friga 40 turned his gas station into a parking lot offering spaces for $ 15 a pop it was only fair he said considering all the business he would lose the avid nixon admirer was planning to attend a $ 250aplate dinner in the former presidents honor at the century plaza hotel on thursday night i dont feel guilty friga said about charging hapless souls for parking besides how do you think im paying for the dinner back at the dedication ceremony george p shultz served as sort of an aidedecamp to henry a kissinger for a brief period before the presidents speeches shortly after the two men arrived and were seated in the vip area shultz could be seen passing programs from others in the vip section to kissinger for autographs kissinger obliged everyone few seemed interested in shultzs autograph in contrast to the misspelled sign another banner not only got nixons name right it gave a warning to president bush the sign posted across the street from the library said watch out george hes tan rested and ready
