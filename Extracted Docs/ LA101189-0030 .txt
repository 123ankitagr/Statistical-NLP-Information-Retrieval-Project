Verdi , Puccini or Wagner were n't on the bill when the Cleveland Opera opened its season Tuesday night . Unfolding on stage was `` Holy Blood and Crescent Moon , '' an opera written by Stewart Copeland , 37 , former drummer for the rock group The Police . Copeland , who spent six years with the Police before going on to score movies and television shows and write music for a San Francisco Ballet production , does n't put himself in the same league as the masters , but does use arias , choruses , grandiose sets and other traditional opera trappings . His opera is a love story of a prince and the daughter of a Palestinian ruler who help each other despite the wars their people wage . Copeland 's father headed the Middle East office of the CIA and he grew up in the region . The opera took four years to write and came about when he was urged to make good on a flip remark in 1984 that he might write another ballet `` after I finish my opera . '' ALEENE MacMINN
