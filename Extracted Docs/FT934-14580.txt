a growing reluctance among japanese banks to guarantee bond defaults is prompting a greater awareness of credit risk among japanese institutional investors according to moody's investors services the us credit rating agency japanese banks are required by law to act as trustees to bond issues providing cover in the event of default losses as a result issuer credit risk has rarely been reflected in japanese bond yields banks have absorbed the risks of bankruptcy by an issuer they have repaid the bond holder in full and then sold the collateral on the bonds to cover their costs however faced with deteriorating balance sheets japanese banks are increasingly reluctant to take on such risks says moody's if an issuer were to go bankrupt investors can no longer expect immediate repayment from banks in full face value of the debt banks are now more likely first to dispose of an issue's collateral before reimbursing bondholders moody's says the recent easing of restrictions on issues of uncollateralised bonds poses additional risk for investors as japanese investors become more aware of such changes they will include credit risks of the corporate issuers among their investment criteria a clearer risk-return relationship could soon become reality within the japanese corporate bond market
