TV DINNERS , those ubiquitous timesavers , have been popular with moms and kids since Uncle Miltie and Howdy Doody dominated the small screen . Now man 's best friend can join the rest of the family with his or her own frozen dinner : Le Gourmet meals , prepared by Breeder 's Choice -- a small family-owned business in Irwindale noted for its line of zoo-food catering to non-domestic felines and birds of prey since 1947 . Each meal is a 14-ounce , fully cooked little meat loaf ( about 90 cents ) made from beef or chicken and all-natural grains and oils . Enriched with vitamins and minerals , the dinners contain no preservatives and are ready to eat in less than five minutes when heated in the microwave . Also available are a Lamb and Rice dinner ( for finicky eaters ) , the Avoderm ( designed to replenish the oils in a dog 's coat ) and a frozen dinner for the epicurean kitty . Le Gourmet meals are available at Feed-Rite Pet Shop , in the Farmers Market , 6333 W. 3rd St. , Los Angeles , ( 213 ) 936-8833 , and at other pet stores . 1 LINDA ZIMMERMAN
