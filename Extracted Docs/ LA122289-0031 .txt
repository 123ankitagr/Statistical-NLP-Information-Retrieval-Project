with marine riflemen army paratroopers and navy seals already moving through the darkness toward panama president bush went over the final invasion plans one last time tuesday night at 4 am wednesday he was still awake in his white house study when aides came to suggest an early morning televised address to the nation reports of substantial casualties on both sides were pouring in and bush was eager to explain his decision to send us troops against the regime of panamanian strongman manuel a noriega the president readily agreed to go on television at 7 am after a quick walk to his living quarters and a twohour nap he was back in the oval office by 630 am he was very concerned about the loss of life said a senior government official but he also understands the role of the military and that they take those risks with pride bush by turns open and secretive somber and bantering is putting his own characteristic stamp on one role an american president shares with no one else commander in chief of the armed forces outwardly he has made almost a fetish of sticking to a businessasusual schedule since he met secretly with aides sunday night to approve specific plans for the massive military strike but behind the scenes he has stayed in close touch with the unfolding events in panama he was not only deeply involved in the military planning he also has been closely monitoring the results of the operation at every stage yet for bush and for every president the decision to send military forces into action is a plunge into the unknown and the unknowable such action tests a presidents personal and political balance his judgment and credibility and ultimately his relationship with the people who elected him when us forces go into combat presidents normally enjoy a surge of support as the public and congress rally round the flag historically sustaining that support has often proved difficult especially if a conflict drags on and casualties continue for bush that longerterm political challenge may be particularly great in panama because the tiny nations economy and governmental structures have been shattered by the us assault and the depth of resistance fueled in part by the antiamericanism endemic in latin america has surprised us officials the president himself is well aware of these factors said a senior aide who described bush as intense but unemotional sunday as he questioned military officials about their plans to invade panama he knew it was a major decision for panama and the united states for his administration and for history the aide said from sunday afternoon until today thursday it has been a sober time for him and by all accounts he has gone about his job as commanderinchief with almost supreme selfconfidence as he put it at an impromptu news conference thursday bush intends to conduct the foreign policy of this country the way i think best if the american people dont like it i expect theyll get somebody else to take my job but im going to keep doing it when a reporter asked if it was really worth it to send people to their death for the military objectives bush declared that defense department officials had been candid about the potential for casualties adding and every human life is precious and yet i have to answer yes it has been worth it bush acknowledged at his news conference that he had been extraordinarily frustrated that noriega had clung to power despite intense us pressure the aide said the president had made up his mind to take some kind of action against noriega even before the sunday afternoon white house meeting at which he decided to launch a massive military strike he made a decision a hard one and a very firm one and he never wavered from it said a senior government official he believed the time had come to act and there was no question of anyone trying to argue him out of it or anything he said lets do it if we dont itll only get worse and people snapped to the question then became what kind of action at the white house meeting bush listened intently as army gen colin l powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff outlined military options including a possible surgical strike that would involve a limited number of troops whose mission would be to seize noriega aides said that the president quickly became convinced that massive force was the best way both to limit casualties and to achieve the broader objectives of protecting americans in panama and installing a new government headed by guillermo endara the apparent winner of a may election that noriega aborted bush closely questioned powell and other military officials about the details of their plan for a massive attack one aide said that he asked such questions as well why do you want to take that building and how long does it take to get from the airport to the site of the attack in particular bush carefully analyzed the potential risk to civilians although the president has remained in almost constant contact with developments in panama he has managed to keep a regular schedule on other matters he has gone to great lengths to give the appearance of business as usual at the white house he has told staffers and other administration officials that they should not let the panama situation interfere with their christmas plans when secretary of state james a baker iii asked bush whether he should cancel his plans to return to his home in texas for the holidays the president told him it would not be necessary to remain in washington bush has not let the panama situation interfere with his own christmas schedule he plans to spend christmas at camp david the presidential retreat in maryland and leave two days later for a weeks visit to texas there he will go to the beeville ranch of his friend will farish where he traditionally spends the holidays between christmas and new years day white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said the president may stop off at the military hospital in san antonio where servicemen wounded in panama are being treated i dont know how the president manages to keep his equilibrium under such pressure said a senior government official ive seen a lot of frayed nerves during this panama stuff but not his in times of stress he seems to get cooler and quieter which is a good signal for people to pay attention and do what theyre supposed to do some people who are under pressure beat up on other people but not the president aides said that bush realizes he still faces tremendous problems the potential for even more casualties a panamanian government that will require considerable us aid just to survive noriegas continued potential to cause problems as long as he remains at large and a possible adverse reaction by the american public if panama remains a longterm drain on american resources he still has some anxieties because there are a lot of problems and potential problems still out there one white house official said but hes genuinely pleased about the way the military performed and he has assured himself that what he is doing is the right thing and realistic under the circumstances and bushs own informal style of communicating with the public could also pose a problem his tendency to minimize the significance of events and dampen expectations might not serve him well during a military crisis at his news conference thursday bush projected his familiar image a man at ease and able to joke confident that matters are under control as he spoke however the bodies of soldiers killed in panama were being unloaded at dover air force base in delaware viewers of cbs and cnn saw bush smiling on one side of the screen while on the other side marine color guards were escorting caskets off c141 starlifter planes fitzwater called the juxtaposition unfortunate and said that the networks were unfair not to tell the president they intended to show the arriving caskets side by side with the news conference
