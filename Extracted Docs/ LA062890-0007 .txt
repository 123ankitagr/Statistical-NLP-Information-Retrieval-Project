this is supposed to be june gloom that's what the month between may and july is ordinarily called in san diego but in looking for a word to describe this june gloom just isn't a strong contender local experts suggest maybe a new name is needed june weird as san diego broke a record for heat wednesday the high at lindbergh field reached 91 degrees surpassing the mark of 1976 the weathered weather types scrambled to find out why this has certainly been an unusual month said dan atkin meteorologist with the national weather service it's been the wettest june ever in san diego and that was from one storm and now we've got this heat atkin said san diego received 0.38 of an inch of rain on june 9, followed by 0.48 of an inch the next day breaking two daily records the accumulated 0.86 of an inch set a monthly record in average years atkin said june is our cloudiest month of the year on the average the smallest amount of possible sunshine we receive in san diego is 57 we don't have complete figures yet but this june has been much sunnier than normal atkin said the traditional june gloom is caused by a blast of heat welling up from the desert and coming into conflict with very cool air over the water at the same time high pressure is starting to form which traps the marine air in july and august we usually break through the temperature inversion and it gets much much hotter this year it happened earlier atkin said the temperature this time of year usually hovers around 73 degrees he speculated that part of the extreme conditions not just here but nationally is caused by el nino and the greenhouse effect not just summers but winters too atkin said are now more severe bill hibbert a meteorologist with weatherdata inc in wichita kan which supplies weather information for the times believes the greenhouse effect and el nino as well as its female counterpart la nina have had a profound effect on weather nationwide particularly in the southwest hibbert defines the greenhouse effect as man's influence on the environment where industrial processes and consumer excesses have generated gases that tend to absorb solar radiation rather than let it transfer freely el nino is the shifting of temperatures on the surface of the sea hibbert said people generally don't recognize that oceans cover three-fourths of the planet's surface receiving three-fourths of the sunlight that shines on the earth at any given time normally el nino affects southern california with much wetter weather what people don't know as much about is la nina which imposes the opposite condition that produces a cooling of ocean surface temperatures resulting in excessively dry weather which you're now having in southern california he said both can be equally virulent especially with both occurring in conjunction with other weather patterns what you have to remember is with weather nothing stands alone everything is interconnected and whatever the connection is at the moment it's producing extreme heat and very dry conditions in southern california but believe me it's hardly as bad as wichita where i am i'll trade with you any time
