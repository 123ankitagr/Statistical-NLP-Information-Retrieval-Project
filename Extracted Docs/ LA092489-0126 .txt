The state 's Republican Committee on Saturday declined to censure state Rep. David Duke for his past as a leader of the Ku Klux Klan . The committee has no authority to kick Duke out of the party , but two committee members who worked on the censure said they had done so because of Duke 's past of `` promoting racial violence , his anti-Semitism and his neo-Nazi philosophies . '' Neil Curran and Elizabeth Rickey , both of New Orleans , tried to introduce the resolution at the party 's quarterly meeting . The resolution was tabled without debate . Curran and Rickey worked for Duke 's opponent , John Treen , during the campaign , Duke said . `` Basically , they ca n't accuse me of doing anything wrong . They ca n't question my stated platforms . They have to go back in my past , '' Duke said . Lee Atwater , chairman of the Republican National Committee , censured Duke after he won his legislative seat in February . But the state Republican Party has shied away from any move to censure Duke . Duke , from Metairie , joined the klan in 1968 and left in 1980 after six years as grand wizard , a national post . Duke later founded a group called the National Assn . for the Advancement of White People , which he still heads .
