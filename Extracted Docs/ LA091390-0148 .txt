as part of the continuing tugofwar between landlords and rent control hardliners in santa monica city rent control officials are contemplating a tightening of regulations governing the circumstances under which landlords can evict tenants and go out of business a proposal scheduled for a public hearing tonight before the rent control board would require landlords who file notice of their intent to evict tenants and remove their properties from the rental market to carry through with the evictions within 60 days members of the rent board which is dominated by tenant partisans say the change is needed because they say some landlords have been filing notices of intent to evict tenants to induce tenants to vacate apartments voluntarily because of the tight rental market in santa monica the argument goes many tenants who are notified of a landlords intent to evict do not wait for a formal eviction notice before finding another apartment these tenants are inclined to grab another rentcontrolled apartment whenever they can find one when this happens rent board officials say some landlords then rent the apartments to more desirable tenants particularly people with higher incomes who might also be willing to pay underthetable finders fees for a rentcontrolled apartment the eviction process under rent control is governed by a state law called the ellis act which sets forth the conditions under which landlords can evict tenants and remove their property from the rental market and use it for some another purpose for santa monica landlords chronically unhappy with the low rents allowed by the rent board the ellis law has become their primary weapon for striking back and attempting to force change the rent boards new proposal is an attempt to finetune local regulations implementing the ellis act in addition to preventing landlords from seeking to create voluntary vacancies the proposed change is designed to remove the uncertainty of whether or not the evictions will take place officials said since the ellis act took effect in 1986 owners of about 200 apartment buildings in santa monica have filed notices with the city of their intent to evict tenants and go out of business according to rent board officials however only about threequarters of those landlords have gone forward with the evictions rent control board officials say owners of 141 properties with about 700 units have evicted tenants twenty owners subsequently withdrew their applications and 34 applications affecting 335 units are in limbo it is the applications in limbo where the threat of eviction exists but the landlord has not taken any further action and continues business as usual that the proposed changes would affect ellis has been used to intimidate tenants and the most valuable change is that it would basically stop landlords from making such threats said rent board commissioner wayne bauer who favors the change i dont think it is going to stop evictions but it will force landlords to be serious about it rent board chairwoman susan packer davis said at least it lets tenants know that its for real but carl lambert an attorney and landlord calls the proposed requirement a meaningless change that detracts from the real issue behind the growing number of ellis filings that the existing system has made the business not worthwhile for landlords in any event the regulatory changes being considered by the rent board may prove insignificant compared to changes in the rent control system that could result from the nov 6 election two ballot measures dealing with rent control one sponsored by landlords and a competing measure proposed by rentcontrol advocates would allow for substantial increases in rents on voluntarily vacated apartments lambert and other landlords contend that unless the landlordbacked measure passes permitting virtual decontrol of rents when apartments are voluntarily vacated there will be a surge of ellis act evictions and a sharp decline in the number of apartments in the city the rent boards public hearing tonight is at 730 in the city hall council chamber
