nerve cells from a patients intestine may soon be transplanted to cure brain disease the british association meeting at keele heard yesterday animal studies at university college london show that nerve cells transplanted from a rats gut into its brain grow into the surrounding tissue while at the same time nerves from the brain penetrate the transplant some of the animals had brain damage which would be a good model for human degenerative disorders notably huntingtons chorea and parkinsons disease professor geoffrey burnstock head of anatomy and developmental biology at ucl says guttobrain transplants would avoid many problems posed by foetal transplants where cells have been transplanted from human foetuses into the brains of parkinsons sufferers as a means of rewiring damaged nerves more than 100000 people in the uk suffer from parkinsons dr peter jenner of the parkinsons disease experimental research laboratories at kings college london described the findings as very exciting the foetal technique had been overhyped and produced false hopes because the foetal cells had not grown well enough he said the best results were on patients in sweden but none had recovered sufficiently to stop taking drugs most of the chemical messengers which control brain activity are present in the gut cells there would be no possibility of the transplant being rejected by the patients immune system because it came from his or her own intestines and the ethical objections to using foetal cells would not exist the next stage in prof burnstocks research will be to discover what it is about the gut transplant that triggers nerves in the brain to start growing usually damage to the brain is permanent because nerves do not grow back if the factors responsible are isolated they could be used to treat spinal injuries and other nerve damage the ucl research also opens up the possibility of curing inherited brain disease guttobrain transplants could be used to deliver correct copies of faulty genes prof burnstock said the nervous system of the gut was sometimes known as a small brain because it could sustain so many sophisticated reflex activities independently of the central nervous system more than 60 of the transmitter chemicals it uses were also produced in the brain it is not clear how soon the research could be applied to humans further animal studies are needed to find out how selective a transplants effect is and how its growth is controlled
