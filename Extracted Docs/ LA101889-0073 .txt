The Soviet Union 's attitude toward human rights has improved dramatically , and most political prisoners have been freed , although abuses persist and the picture is `` deeply confusing , '' Amnesty International says . In a report published today , the worldwide human rights movement says its list of Soviet citizens imprisoned for nonviolent exercise of their human rights shrank from 600 three years ago to about 90 in July , and would have been lower but for further arrests . An Amnesty International delegation , allowed into the Soviet Union for the first time last March , found that `` the Soviet perspective on human rights has shifted dramatically since 1986 , '' the report said . `` The most promising prospect for long-term reform is a major review of law . . . apparently aimed at bringing Soviet law into line with international standards , '' the report said . For the first time , human rights issues are being freely discussed and acknowledged by the authorities to be an international issue , not an internal matter immune from outside scrutiny , it said . The Soviet Union hopes to hold the Helsinki Review Conference on Human Rights in Moscow in 1991 . Amnesty International said that of the 600 prisoners , 337 were released early , and another 79 were freed from psychiatric hospitals where some had spent 15 years or more against their will . `` Most of these 416 people were prosecuted for expressing nonconformist opinions , or for their religious activities . Some had been arrested for trying to leave the U.S.S.R. , '' it said . `` They make up the largest single group of prisoners of conscience to have been freed since the 1950s . Political arrests have also fallen noticeably since 1986 , '' it said .
