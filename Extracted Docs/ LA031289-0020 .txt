How sad that members of the `` brat pack '' were so disillusioned by their trip . Our recent collaboration between top American songwriters and Soviet tunesmiths -- the U.S./U.S.S.R . Songwriters Summit in November , 1988 -- revealed the best of a new society struggling to be better . We missed our gourmet restaurants , limos and satin sheets , too . But perhaps our group ( Cyndi Lauper , Michael Bolton , Brenda Russell , Barry Mann and 50 others , including film crew ) were more philosophical by virtue of maturity . Where the `` brat pack '' saw food shortages , we noticed a country where everyone is fed . Where other visitors may have seen small and unglamorous housing , we were in awe of a place where everyone is sheltered . There are no people sleeping in cardboard boxes on the streets of Moscow . And , most dear to our hearts , artists , composers , writers and athletes are all treated as useful citizens and given training , support and respect . America has come to its success through a different route . Although a lack of monetary rewards for extra effort may demotivate the Soviets , we know from having negotiated with them under their new system that ambition is not something they lack . Please understand -- we saw the repression , alcoholism , shortages , disorganization , corruption and boredom with which Soviet life is plagued . But we chose to view these problems as we do American problems -- as those that can be solved . ROBYN WHITNEY Hollywood
