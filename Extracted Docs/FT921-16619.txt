sir i read with interest the article by christopher lorenz japan should give the locals a chance november 15 and mr mike parrs letter november 22 as a british expatriate manager working in a large japanese company i agree with many of mr lorenzs comments and sympathise with much of mr parrs experience however neither of these views provides a complete picture in my role as manager planning and industrial relations team i have struggled with my japanese colleagues to foster greater understanding between worldwide cultures and the japanese corporate culture our successes have not so far been spectacular but the learning process most certainly has been any solution lies somewhere between the lorenzparr extremes it is a myth that japanese people live only to work it is a fact that japanese people have the same hopes fears and aspirations as the average westerner and quite openly speak out in their frustration at corporate policies it is more than possible to build trust and confidence and varying degrees of power albeit usually manifested in influence rather than authority through normal and honest labour i was recruited in the uk in 1986 and during the next five years worked hard but no harder than i did in the british company where i was previously employed my office time averaged between 9 and 10 hours each day and afterhours networking in bars was necessary only once a week on average i saw my family far more frequently than my japanese colleagues and i did not need to learn japanese until last year finally success within japanese kaisha depends very much on expatriates willingness to pioneer from within to encourage change determination to succeed sensitivity towards others communication skills and an ability to balance persistence with patience given these i am certain the next decade will see greater penetration of locals into the japanese corporate hierarchy barry chester mitsubishi corporation 63 marunouchi 2chome chiyodaku tokyo 10086
