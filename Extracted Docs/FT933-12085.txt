SG Warburg was last week wrongly described as the architect of a new money purchase service with a guaranteed fund . In fact , Mercury Asset Management ( MAM ) is offering the product through its Mercury Life Assurance Company subsidiary . Munich Reinsurance has agreed to provide reinsurance on the potential liabilities of Mercury Life in connection with the guaranteed fund . MAM is 75 per cent owned by the SG Warburg group .
