Baseball Commissioner Fay Vincent , his voice cracking with emotion , lost his balance and fell to the stage of Carnegie Hall today during a tribute to his predecessor , A. Bartlett Giamatti . Vincent , who had just finished an eloquent tribute to his friend , turned from the podium to return to his seat and lost his balance . He was helped to his feet by Joe DiMaggio and Bobby Doerr . `` I apologize , '' Vincent said to the audience . Vincent walks with a cane as the result of a vertebra injury during college and the onset of arthritis . `` I feel embarrassed , '' he said later . `` I hope I did n't spoil anything . '' Just before he fell , Vincent 's voice broke during the final part of what was called `` A Celebration of Bart Giamatti and Baseball . '' `` To me , he was the noblest of them all , '' he said , using words from Shakespeare . `` Brave , noble Bart , and goodby . '' Giamatti died of a heart attack on Sept. 1 at his summer home in Edgartown , Mass. , just five months after becoming commissioner and eight days after he banned Pete Rose from baseball . A succession of speakers praised Giamatti during the 90-minute program . Among the speakers were his son , Marcus Giamatti ; Joe Garagiola ; writers Claire Smith and Roger Angell , and Milwaukee Brewers owner Bud Selig . Also on stage were American League President Bobby Brown , National League President Bill White and Yale President Benno C. Schmidt Jr . The audience was a collection of who 's who in baseball , filled with owners , general managers , scouts , agents , baseball lawyers , arbitrators , television executives , and the staffs of the commissioner 's office and both leagues . The scene outside Carnegie Hall after the program was one of baseball executives milling about on 57th Street and Seventh Avenue , some talking trades and contracts .
