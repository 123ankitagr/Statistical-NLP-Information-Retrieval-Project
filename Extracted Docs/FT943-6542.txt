Four airlines are banning smoking on their transatlantic flights . The most sweeping change comes from Delta Air Lines which says it will ban smoking completely on all flights between the US and Europe from January 1 , citing overwhelming support from passengers for the move . It will be the first US carrier to introduce a total ban on transatlantic flights . From October 1 , American Airlines will extend no-smoking services to two out of six daily flights between New York and London and to one out of two flights between Chicago and London . And from October 30 United Airlines , already experimenting with no-smoking flights on several international routes , will extend a smoking ban to two out of three of its flights between New York and London . British Airways is also widening a no-smoking experiment on October 30 to embrace one of its five daily flights between London and New York and all transatlantic routes to and from Canada .
