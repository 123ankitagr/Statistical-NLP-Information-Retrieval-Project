A senior U.S. official arrived in Beijing today for talks with Chinese officials , one day after a dissident scientist was allowed to leave the American Embassy where he had sheltered for more than a year . Desaix Anderson , deputy assistant secretary of state , will hold talks with Foreign Ministry officials on Sino-American relations and other issues during his stay of about five days , U.S. Embassy officials said . He is the most senior U.S. official to visit China since National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft made a highly controversial visit in December . His visit follows by one day the release of Fang Lizhi and his wife , Li Shuxian . American officials called the timing of the visit coincidental .
