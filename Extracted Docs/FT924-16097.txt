LEAD emissions from road transport have fallen by more than two thirds over the past 10 years , according to figures published by the Department of Transport yesterday . Mr John MacGregor , transport secretary , claimed the statistics as a triumph for government policy on road transport and the environment . 'This is excellent news , and shows what can be done through a combination of fiscal pricing measures and better engine design to improve the environment , ' he said . 'The introduction of catalytic converters on cars is reducing emissions still further - particularly carbon monoxide , oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons . ' The figures , contained in the government 's annual compendium of transport statistics , show lead emissions from road vehicles sliding from 6,700 tonnes in 1981 to 2,200 tonnes in 1990 . One factor was an EC directive sharply lowering the permitted level of lead in petrol in December 1985 . Another was the introduction of unleaded petrol in 1986 , followed by preferential fiscal measures to encourage its use . On a less encouraging note , carbon monoxide emissions are shown to have risen from 4.2m tonnes to 6m tonnes between 1981 and 1990 , an increase of 42 per cent . The compendium also shows that motor traffic increased by 49 per cent between 1981 and 1990 , with car traffic rising by 53 per cent and light van traffic by 59 per cent . Motorcycle traffic fell by 39 per cent . Transport Statistics Great Britain 1992 . HMSO . Pounds 24 .
