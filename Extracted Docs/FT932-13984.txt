Professor D E N Davies , vice-chancellor of Lough-borough University of Technology , is to take over from Sir Ronald Oxburgh as chief scientist at the Ministry of Defence . Davies , who is known universally as Den , has a background in electrical engineering research , with particular interests in radar , antennae and fibre optics - subjects with important defence applications . Oxburgh , in contrast , is a geologist . The MoD post is the second most important chief scientist 's job in Whitehall , after the prime minister 's scientific adviser , because defence still consumes more than 40 per cent of all government spending on research and development . Davies is already familiar with this , as chairman of the Defence Scientific Advisory Council and a member of the Defence Research Agency Council . Loughborough University has enjoyed strong growth in student numbers and research income during the five years in which Davies , 57 , has been in charge . Its reputation for excellence has spread well beyond physical education and sports science . Davies will move from Loughborough to Whitehall at the end of September .
