two airlines are running newspaper ads claiming that each will have the only nonstop flights between hong kong and los angeles which is telling the truth in a sense both any confusion is the result of a deal between american airlines and hong kong-based cathay pacific airways the planes flying the route which will be inaugurated july 1, will be those of cathay pacific but cathay pacific has sold 38 of the seats to american american is selling the seats as if they were on its own planes both airlines say every effort is made to tell passengers that they will actually be flying cathay pacific the american ads also say so in relatively small type such block seat-sale arrangements as they are called can be good business for both carriers cathay pacific is a profit-oriented airline a spokeswoman said this partnership helps assure that the route will be more financially secure and successful american which has no routes to hong kong gets a presence there nevertheless it also gets a chance to attract cathay pacific passengers to its u s routes it gives us a marketing opportunity a spokesman for dallas-based american said american he added hopes one day to fly between hong kong and los angeles but getting foreign routes requires bilateral negotiations between the countries involved as well as approval by the u s government we certainly would like to expand into the pacific rim as much as possible the spokesman said but the airline is putting its major emphasis on acquiring additional routes to japan american's only japan route is between dallas and tokyo agreements such as the one between american and cathay pacific are not unusual airlines have purchased blocks of seats on other airlines before it is often done as cathay pacific is doing when an airline is trying to develop a new market cathay pacific started in 1946 with 30,000 in capital and one route between shanghai and sydney australia using a refurbished military transport plane it is now considered a highly efficient airline it flies throughout asia and to major cities in europe and north america
