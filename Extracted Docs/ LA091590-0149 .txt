A woolly bear caterpillar as weather forecaster ? According to Country America magazine , people have for many years looked to various signs from nature , the bands on the bodies of woolly bear caterpillars among them , as sources for meteorological predictions . Some are simple indications of fact , but some have tales behind them . Here is a sampling : What does an early bloom on a wildflower such as a black-eyed Susan tell about the weather ? Fall will be coming early . Sun dogs -- those orange spots that appear before sunset -- are an indication that there will be rain within the next 24 hours . What can you tell from the rings on the woolly bear caterpillar 's body ? The severity of the coming winter . If , for example , the caterpillar has black bands on either end and a brown band in the middle , expect the winter to begin and end with cold temperatures and to have milder temperatures during the middle . And when butterflies flit high above the rooftops in late fall ? Winter will arrive soon . Spider webs on the ground are another indication that a cold , hard winter is coming .
