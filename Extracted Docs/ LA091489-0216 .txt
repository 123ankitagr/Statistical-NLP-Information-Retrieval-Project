William ( Fishbait ) Miller , a colorful figure who served as doorkeeper of the House of Representatives for nearly 25 years , has died after a long illness . He was 80 . Miller , who introduced six Presidents at joint sessions of Congress in his long tenure and wrote a book , `` Fishbait , '' about the politically powerful in Washington , died of a heart attack at his home here Tuesday . For years Miller would stride into the House chamber and bellow , `` Mister Speaker , the President of the United States '' in his native Mississippi accent . The joint session of Congress would applaud , and Miller would take a seat at the front of the chamber . During his 25 years as House doorkeeper , Miller introduced Presidents Truman , Eisenhower , Kennedy , Johnson , Nixon and Ford when they appeared to address the Congress . Despite the simple title , Miller 's job entailed supervising 357 government workers -- messengers , pages , restroom workers , janitors -- and a $ 3.5-million budget . Miller went to Washington in 1933 at the request of William Colmer , whom he had just helped win election from Mississippi 's 6th Congressional District . Miller rose from a clerk in the House to messenger , sergeant-at-arms and finally to the relatively powerful post of doorkeeper . Except for one session , Miller held the job until 1974 , when the House Democratic majority did not reelect him .
