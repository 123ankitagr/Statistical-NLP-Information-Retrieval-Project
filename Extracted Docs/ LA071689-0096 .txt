I volunteer at the Share Our Selves ( SOS ) in Costa Mesa . We help feed and clothe our poor . As I read in the paper that our President is going to help the Polish poor , I wondered : If the president of either country came to our facility , would they be surprised at our own number of poor ? Even the City Council of Costa Mesa is going to vote on whether to renew the lease for us , with a no vote considered because `` there are no poor in Costa Mesa . '' We have mothers with children living in cars with no cooking facilities , so when we give them their bag of groceries , it has to contain food that does n't have to be cooked . Let 's wake up and hear the cries of our own poor and help . EILEEN MURPHY Huntington Beach
