Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen , leader of France 's extreme right-wing National Front , flew in to Corsica yesterday but was forced to fly straight out again by demonstrators , Reuter reports from Ajaccio . Le Pen 's private aircraft was met by militant stone-throwing separatists who had cut through a fence . Before flying back to Paris , Mr Le Pen shouted : 'The state of Balladur is a dud . Two hundred riot police are powerless in the face of 50 Corsican yobs . '
