the world's two leading nutmeg producers grenada and indonesia are trying to find common ground on which they can control supply and strengthen the world market for the spice recent efforts to lift prices have included destroying stocks the latest move is being pushed by grenada which produces about a quarter of world output and whose economy is more heavily reliant on nutmeg than indonesia's which accounts for virtually all the other 75 per cent the destruction of several hundred tonnes of stock by the countries followed a progressive price decline since their cartel created in 1989, collapsed we have been speaking with the indonesians about the state of the market says mr nicholas brathwaite the prime minister of grenada i do not think that we will get another formal pact but we are hoping that we will be able to reach an agreement whereby we will be able to do something about the supplies to the market he says indonesian industry officials confirm that delegations have been visiting grenada for discussions on how best the producers can co-operate to improve prices they say however that the indonesian industry will not again be party to a cartel that attempts to set prices we have explained this to our grenadian counterparts and they have told us that they also are not interested in resurrecting the earlier agreement says one official what we are doing now is discussing how we can co-operate in the international marketing of the product in the interest of both countries neither grenada nor indonesia are willing to say specifically how the new arrangement will work and the extent of any likely cuts in nutmeg supplies it appears however that if they do reach an agreement they will aim at supplying the market with 9,500 tonnes a year 500 tonnes less than current world demand and 2,500 tonnes less than the current combined production of both countries the cartel collapsed following extensive deregulation of the indonesian economy before it was established the world price for nutmeg was about dollars 1,000 a tonne when the cartel became operative the indonesian producers undertook to sell their high quality nutmeg between dollars 6,800 and dollars 7,000 a tonne while low quality supplies were to be sold between dollars 1,000 and dollars 1,200 a tonne the grenadians had committed themselves to a minimum price of dollars 6,650 a tonne for their best nutmeg with a minimum price for poorer quality nutmeg was dollars 5,575 a tonne prices have since fallen as low as dollars 550 a tonne and have generally been below dollars 1,000 a tonne the price collapse has been particularly painful to grenada for which nutmeg is the main commodity export grenada's earnings from nutmeg exports fell from dollars 18.1 m in 1989 to dollars 4.5 m last year in 1989 our farmers received ecdollars 12 m usdollars 4.5 m in bonus payments because of the prices which we obtained then says mr brathwaite last year there was no bonus for the farmers because the price has fallen so we are in a very difficult situation it remains to be seen whether the new targets for market supplies will include the 3,500 tonnes that grenada has agreed to ship to jhb a belgian company over five years mainly for sale to china any new agreement with indonesia will complement the marketing agreement with jhb grenadian officials say the contract will also allow an increase in supplies of the grenadian spice to the us market in which indonesia is dominant jhb is to brand the product and will take more than the contracted 3,500 tonnes if the chinese market performs well the eastern caribbean island's dependence on foreign earnings from the spice lies behind its need for higher prices the indonesians are more able to tolerate lower world prices because their production costs are lower than grenada's traditionally the market has been willing to pay more for the grenadian product because the quality was higher but in seeking the co-operation of the indonesians this is not a factor that mr brathwaite considers important the purchasers of nutmeg do not usually note that the grenadian product is of a higher quality the prime minister says the quality does not determine the price on the world market
