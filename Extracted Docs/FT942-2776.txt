Exceptional and non-recurring costs were responsible for raising pre-tax losses at Ugland International , the ship owner , manager and dry dock operator , from Pounds 591,000 to Pounds 1.23m in the year to March 31 . The results are the first to be reported by the enlarged group since a new management team acquired control last October from Bristol Channel Ship Repairers , which coincided with a Pounds 19m rights issue , acquisition and name change . Costs of Pounds 816,000 were for re-opening and upgrading dry dock facilities in Swansea and Pounds 171,000 in obtaining a full listing on the Oslo stock exchange . Non-recurring costs of Pounds 187,000 were mainly for bridge finance interest . A maiden final dividend of 0.74p is recommended .
