A bus shuttle program , a traffic crisis management team and more beach access parking lots will be used to alleviate traffic problems in the Venice beach area this summer , Los Angeles City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter said . The shuttle , in its third season of operation , starts at the parking lot on Venice Boulevard near West Washington Boulevard . Rides will be scheduled every 15 minutes from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. on weekends and holidays through Labor Day . The shuttle is free for those who pay $ 3 to park in the lot and 25 cents for others . Galanter 's traffic management team , on duty on summer weekends , will consist of a Department of Transportation traffic engineer who will monitor conditions in the most heavily congested areas and work with traffic control officers to direct traffic flow . In addition , beach access parking lots will be posted , and negotiations are under way with the Los Angeles Unified School District to use parking lots at area elementary schools .
