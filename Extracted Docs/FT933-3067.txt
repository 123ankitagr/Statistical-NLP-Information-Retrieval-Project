general motors the us carmaker is looking to acquire one or more japanese parts makers to increase sales of components in the japanese market mr philip austin vicepresident of gms automotive components group in japan said to be a strong player in any market you need a manufacturing presence and we dont have one in japan although acquisitions of japanese companies by foreign groups have been rare mr austin said the timing was good since many japanese car parts suppliers had suffered from the economic downturn their investments in the us have become a burden and they are overcommitted in japan with borrowings so opportunities obviously exist he said gms move reflects its growing interest in developing its asian operations the components division which currently sells over 70 per cent of its product to the parent company is working to reduce its dependence on the north american market to 50 per cent of revenues by 2000 us and japanese trade negotiators will meet in hawaii next week to discuss the possibility of encouraging japanese purchases of us cars and car parts in an effort to moderate japans huge trade surplus usmade car parts have been more successful in penetrating the japanese market than usmade cars gm for example sells more than twice as much in components in japan as it does in cars and mr austin said gm expected sales to japanese carmakers to reach dollars 2bn globally by 1998 compared with dollars 900m last year japanese carmakers have stated their willingness to try to buy dollars 19bn of foreign car parts in fiscal 1994 and there is a move on the us side to push japan to set a similar target for 1995 and 1996 as well although the political pressure has helped raise awareness on the part of japanese carmakers of the need for change gm has sought to expand its business by working to better meet the needs of customers as a result the us company has even joined the supplier associations of japanese car parts makers which supply a particular car company these meet regularly to discuss their customers policy and improve communications with them
