The Supreme Court , in a case stemming from Delta Air Lines ' takeover of Western Air Lines , today refused to let Delta force the retirement of a group of flight engineers over age 60 . The justices , without comment , let stand a ruling that Delta is bound by an age-bias lawsuit the flight engineers won against Western . A federal judge in California ordered Western in 1981 to abandon its mandatory retirement age of 60 for flight engineers . The judge also permitted pilots to bid for flight engineer jobs when they approached 60 , the retirement age for pilots . That ruling stemmed from a suit by 15 flight engineers who accused Western of violating the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act aimed at protecting older workers .
