Am I missing something , somewhere , along the way ? Admittedly , there are a lot of projects under way these days that I do n't understand . Some of them are highly technical , and thus are beyond me . But there is one basically simple one that is nonetheless beyond my comprehension . Will somebody please tell me : What is the burning need -- or for that matter , any need at all -- for a high-speed rail line between Anaheim and Las Vegas ? With so many really worthy projects that could better use the money , I have to ask : Who needs to get from Anaheim to Las Vegas -- or back -- in a hurry ? For what reason ? And if it 's that important , why ca n't they do it by air ? ALLYN M. SUFFENS Irvine
