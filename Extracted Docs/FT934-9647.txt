BLOOD products from a second German company have been recalled from 64 hospitals because of suspicions that the products may contain the HIV virus , as Germany 's largest medical scandal widens . Haemoplas , a company based in Lower Saxony , is suspected by local authorities of failing regularly to test its blood products for HIV , the virus which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( Aids ) . All hospitals and medical centres in the country using the products have been ordered to send them back to local authorities . Meanwhile , the state prosecutor 's office in Koblenz said it had found two HIV-infected blood samples among the 2,000 tested so far from UB Plasma , the company that caused nationwide panic after it revealed it had not properly tested its blood products for HIV . The prosecutor 's office said it needed to check up to 20,000 blood products from UB Plasma , a process which could continue well into next year . The revelations have caused tens of thousands of worried Germans to telephone local hospitals and medical centres to ask for advice or seek an Aids test .
