Sir , Is it me , or might one call Mr Ferdinand Piech of Volkswagen a bit self-absorbed in thinking that US group General Motors is trying not only to destroy his company , but to undermine the Germany economy as well ( 'VW chief in furious attack on GM ' , July 28 ) ? I may be wrong on this , but I would imagine that the German economy is perfectly capable of destroying itself with or without the help of Volkswagen or General Motors .
