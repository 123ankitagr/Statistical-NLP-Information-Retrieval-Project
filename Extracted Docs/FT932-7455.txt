VENEZUELA 'S opposition parties have launched an offensive over how long acting President Octavio Lepage should stay in office , just three days after being sworn in . Mr Lepage , backed by his Democratic Action Party , wants to stay in office for 90 days or more . But the opposition says he should have no more than 30 days and a joint session of congress should elect a new president from its members before then . As a former senator , Mr Lepage would presumably be eligible . Mr Lepage , a veteran politician , took over as caretaker president after the senate decided there were grounds to impeach President Carlos Andres Perez , who was suspended from his duties . Mr Perez was due to complete his five-year elected term on February 2 1994 , but now must face charges of mishandling government funds . Ex-president Rafael Caldera , a leading candidate in presidential elections scheduled for next December , said the congress should vote within a week on a new president , and warned that he would demand an opinion from the supreme court if Mr Lepage tried to stay longer than 30 days . While Venezuela 's constitution clearly defines a presidential succession procedure in case of the death or resignation of a sitting chief executive , it is not precise on the question of a temporary presidential absence . Mr Lepage has served as acting president for short periods under two previous governments . Constitutionally , he is first in line to replace a sitting president as chairman of the Senate , and as such chairman of the National Congress . Mr Lepage served as minister of the interior under President Perez during the latter 's first presidential term in the 1970s , and under President Jaime Lusinchi , who was in office from 1983 to early 1989 . In these posts , he was made acting president when the president went abroad . He has served in Congress for many years , first as a deputy then as a senator .
