San Diego leads California cities in the number of assault weapons registered under a new state law , but the state Justice Department says the registered arms are only a tiny fraction of those possessed by gun owners . The Justice Department reported Tuesday that 231 assault weapons -- including Uzis , AK-47s , MAC-10s and similar guns -- were registered in San Diego during the past 18 months . San Diego , California 's second-largest city , has about 1.2 million people . Under the law , people who owned assault weapons before June , 1989 , and register them before Dec. 31 of this year are legally entitled to keep them .
