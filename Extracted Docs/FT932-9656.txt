SOUTH KOREA said yesterday that it may soon resume talks with North Korea in an attempt to encourage it to remain a signatory of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) . The announcement followed the UN Security Council 's adoption on Tuesday of a resolution urging North Korea to reconsider its decision to withdraw from the NPT and open its nuclear facilities to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency . The resolution also included the implied threat of economic sanctions if Pyongyang blocks further nuclear inspections . The resolution was approved by a vote of 13-0 , with China , North Korea 's most influential ally , and Pakistan abstain-ing . Seoul will co-ordinate its policy on North Korean talks with the US , which has indicated that it is willing to hold high-level discussions with Pyongyang on the nuclear issue . South Korea is proposing to grant concessions to North Korea if it returns to the NPT , including a reduction in the size of the annual US-South Korean military exercises and opening US military bases in South Korea to inspections by the North . Seoul is also prepared to offer aid to North Korea 's struggling economy . North Korea said during the UN debate on Tuesday that the nuclear issue could be solved through negotiations with the US . North Korea believes that such talks could be the first step to diplomatic recognition by Washington . North Korea rejected the UN resolution , accusing the Security Council of interfering in its internal affairs . The official news agency KCNA quoted a statement by a foreign ministry spokesman as saying the government considered the resolution 'an interference in its internal affairs and a grave infringement on its sovereignty ' .
