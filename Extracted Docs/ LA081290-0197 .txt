realty martin genis of douglas properties represented the seller the taj mahal is on the market but it's not the one in agra india it's the one in the san francisco bay it's a houseboat that looks like a floating taj and is the weekend home of deborah and william harlan docked in the sausalito yacht harbor at a cost of 2,500 a month the 200-ton-plus houseboat is a combination of mogul and moorish architecture with its white slender towers graceful arches and onion-shaped domes the 4,500 square-foot houseboat has two domes instead of one like the indian landmark but the cut-out fascia above its entrance was copied from a portal of the original taj the long boardwalk leading to the houseboat even resembles the lengthy approach to the famous mausoleum the houseboat also has such features as a sauna whirlpool tub wine cellar four fireplaces two kitchens three bedrooms four baths and an elevator to service three levels of living but its back yard is the bay and that's why the

square feet including a guest house chauffeur's and housekeeper's quarters and a number of bedrooms under the tennis court a realtor noted the property had quietly been marketed at 25 million and was sold to a saudi prince just before the current middle east crisis for slightly more than the sultan was going to pay for it the sources said the sultan had the house in escrow for eight months at 18.5 million before radon was discovered there the radon problem was really minor so i'm sure it was taken care of said a home inspector familiar with the house the house was built five years ago on a four-acre site purchased from former media magnate walter h annenberg for 2.9 million the realtor said before he bought the bel-air house the saudi prince had been negotiating to buy merv griffin's
