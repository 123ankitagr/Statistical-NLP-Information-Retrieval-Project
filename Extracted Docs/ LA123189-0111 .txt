drinkers beware when the new year begins at midnight a tough new law will take effect making it all the more risky to drink and drive as the 1990s begin law enforcement officers will be armed with a new blood alcohol standard that will reduce the amount of alcohol one can drink before being presumed drunk under the new law the existing blood alcohol standard of 10 will drop to 08 the difference is substantial a 150pound person could have three drinks in an hour and still register below the 10 mark according to the department of motor vehicles but that same person would now have to limit the number of drinks to two in an hour to stay below the new standard the california highway patrol warns that new years eve partygoers should cut back on their drinking or find a way to stay away from the wheel the law takes effect at one minute after midnight and thats when were going to put it into effect said chp deputy commissioner spike helmick people who are going to run the risk of drinking and driving had better drink less this year tonight he noted nearly every chp officer in the state will be on duty and looking for drunk drivers but beyond new years eve state officials hope the stricter standard will help persuade drinkers to change their habits permanently and avoid driving while intoxicated helmick urged groups of drinkers to pick a designated driver who will remain sober or he said people who have had too much to drink should take a cab call a friend or find another way home california is one of only four states to adopt the restrictive 08 blood alcohol level standard the others are maine oregon and utah sen bill leonard rbig bear the author of the law said medical evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that people are intoxicated when their blood alcohol level reaches 08 in fact leonard said tests have shown that many individuals can be drunk at levels of 05 or less even at as low as a 02 blood alcohol level drinking can interfere with a drivers judgment he said the amount of alcohol that will produce a 08 level varies from person to person and will depend on such factors as an individuals weight and how recently he or she has eaten but for a person who weighs between 90 and 149 pounds three drinks consumed during a twohour period is almost certain to produce a blood alcohol level of 08 according to the chp one drink is considered 12 ounces of beer four ounces of wine or 1 14 ounces of 80proof liquor similarly for a person who weighs between 150 and 189 pounds four drinks during a twohour period will result in intoxication leonard said his goal in carrying the bill was to reduce the number of drunk driving fatalities not to increase the number of people arrested for driving under the influence i dont want to see anybody arrested he said i want to see people drinking and having fun and driving when sober after years of rejecting the lower level the legislature agreed this year to adopt the 08 blood alcohol standard to reduce the number of deaths and fatalities on californias highways more than 2500 people died in 1988 as a result of drunk driving accidents and more than 65000 others were injured so far this year 1789 have died in drunk driving accidents the chps helmick estimates that 25000 people have died in california during the 1980s as a result of drunk driving during the same period well over 3 million people have been arrested for driving while intoxicated at the same time helmick noted that the 1980s have seen the enactment of much tougher laws against drunk driving and an increasing perception that driving while intoxicated is socially unacceptable tougher penalties include a mandatory jail term and loss of drivers license for the first offense and fines that can reach $ 1500 even tougher laws have been passed by the legislature and will take effect in the coming years in 1992 truck drivers will be subject to a strict blood alcohol standard of 04 and beginning in july 1990 law enforcement officers will be authorized to immediately confiscate the drivers license of anyone found to be driving under the influence were going to start taking away the licenses when the handcuffs go on helmick said chp commissioner maury hannigan said the adoption of the 08 standard for motorists is a recognition of the fact that drivers are affected after consuming smaller amounts of alcohol than the state has acknowledged in the past most people are impaired to the point where it diminishes their driving skills and judgment after just two drinks in one hour hannigan said people who drive after drinking are a threat to themselves and others on the road even if they only drank what we previously thought was a small amount drunk driving law this chart shows the percentage of alcohol in the blood for various weight levels after one hour from the time the first drink was consumed one drink is defined as a 12 ounce beer a 4 ounce glass of wine or a 1 14 ounce shot of 80 proof liquor under the new law that takes effect jan 1 a driver with 08 or higher is presumed to be drunk however those with lower levels could also be cited for drunk driving individual number of drinks in one hour weight one
