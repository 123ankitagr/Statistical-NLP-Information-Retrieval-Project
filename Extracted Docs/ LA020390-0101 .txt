This Valentine 's Day , try something a little more daring than a box of chocolates . Write a love letter to someone you love , or to someone you hope will love you back . `` Love letters are never out of style , '' said Susan Polis Schutz , co-founder of Blue Mountain Arts , a Boulder , Colo. , greeting card company . `` Everyone needs to communicate honestly . Often it 's easier to do it in writing . '' Writing a love letter -- to some , a terrifying prospect -- may be easier than you think , Schutz said . `` I know I find it a lot easier to write my feelings down , especially about love , '' she said . A letter can be more honest ; some people are too embarrassed to speak their feelings . You can think about it in advance , and rewrite it as many times as you want . And a letter can be saved . `` For the receiver , it is very nice to get a letter because it 's something you can see and hold for a long time , '' said Schutz . `` A conversation goes into your heart , but you ca n't see it later . '' Do n't sweat over trying to find just the right style , she recommends . `` Just write it and , if it expresses what you think , fine . Do n't be afraid of what style it is , or what others will think or who will judge it . The purpose is to express your feelings . And that 's the only purpose . ''
