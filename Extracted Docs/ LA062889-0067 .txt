Leftist guerrillas claimed responsibility for the assassination of El Salvador 's national fire department chief . The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said on rebel radio that a commando unit ambushed Col. Roberto Armando Rivera , 45 . It said Rivera 's death was justified because `` he was a military officer with a clear record of criminal acts and repression . '' They said he gave courses in psychological warfare and interrogation techniques and was linked to right-wing death squads that terrorized the country in the early 1980s .
