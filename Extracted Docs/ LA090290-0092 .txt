train is long gone but the bermudan government in 1984 converted the rails to trails the result is the bermuda railway trail a 22-mile footpath that offers travelers an intimate look at the island the bermuda railway did not have an easy time getting on track by the time it opened in 1931, it already had two dubious achievements to its name it was the most costly railway line ever built more than 1 million and its rate of construction 2 1 23 miles per year the slowest ever achieved nevertheless the railway was a distinct improvement over the muddy roads and horse-drawn carriages the line and rolling stock deteriorated after world war ii and the government sold it lock stock and locomotive to british guiana now guyana now the former railway line is a wonderful walk the grade as you might expect is easy oleander and hibiscus hedges line the trail which at times gives walkers the feeling that they're stepping down a garden path countless subtropical flowers perfume the salt air the islanders are extremely polite helpful and particularly friendly to anyone exploring their island on foot all of bermuda cities sights and beaches is within reach of the railway trail although the
