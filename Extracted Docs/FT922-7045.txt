Sir , The Department of Employment 's commitment to tackling age discrimination as a priority of the UK presidency of the EC ( 'Over 35 is over the hill for Brussels job-seekers ' , May 15 ) will deservedly highlight this issue at European level . UK members of the European parliament have for some time been pressing for action to lift upper age limits on recruitment to EC institutions both via the parliament 's Intergroup on Ageing and through parliamentary questions . The European Parliament has called several times for action to stop age discrimination in the Community . The European Court of Justice recently took a small step in the right direction , by raising its upper age for recruitment to executive posts from 32 to 40 . But the European Parliament , as well as the Commission , continues to set upper limits of 33 . The UK government should , as a priority , persuade the EC institutions to lift their upper age limits during 1992 , and set an example to employers . Hugh McMahon , Jack Stewart-Clark , UK co-presidents of the European Parliament's Intergroup on Ageing
