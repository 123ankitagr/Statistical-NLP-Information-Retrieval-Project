Sir , How did Laura Thompson manage to overlook Newcastle United in her review of the English season ( Sport : 'Blessed break for the game ' , May 23 ) ? They are surely the very thing she was looking for - a team that plays with the skill , attitude and flair of Manchester United but which , more often than not , is composed solely of English outfield players . Newcastle United may not quite match up to Manchester United yet in consistency of performance throughout the season , but there is every indication they will do so very soon .
