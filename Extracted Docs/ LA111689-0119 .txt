it was supposed to be a routine and somewhat wistful event the last time the moorpark city council would select a mayor from among its five members but instead the municipal ritual went out with a bang angering and delighting an audience of approximately 75 citizens in the end paul lawrason a 61yearold contracts director for a small aerospace firm was chosen the eighth mayor in the citys sixyear history by a 32 vote but not until there had been a bitter fight against his colleague bernardo perez and a raucous 15minute recess to give the participants a chance to collect themselves moorpark voters last year overwhelmingly adopted an initiative enabling them to elect their mayor rather than having the five council members choose the mayor from among themselves the ballot measure grew out of a city scandal in which one councilman was forced to resign and the mayor was recalled amid neverproven allegations of kickbacks from a developer wednesday night marked the last time the council would select a mayor a largely ceremonial post because the 25000resident city employs a fulltime city manager perez a 40yearold employee of the los angeles department of water and power and the councils mayor pro tem wanted to be the last chosen mayor he was nominated by councilman clint harper as expected but in a turn of events that appeared to catch perez off guard councilman scott montgomery proposed that the position be rotated during the coming term montgomery proposed rotating the mayors job among himself perez and lawrason who were all elected last year and have not yet had a chance to serve as mayor perez who appeared nonplussed said he would refuse to participate in such a plan at that point montgomery nominated lawrason perezs supporter harper said we dont contribute to the community by making moorpark appear to its residents and to other cities to be a bit of a political circus what were doing tonight is introducing personal feelings when they shouldnt be there in other communities this would be virtually automatic montgomery was elected mayor pro tem after perez refused the nomination
