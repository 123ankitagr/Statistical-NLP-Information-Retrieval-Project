advertising budgets in many uk companies were scrutinised and then slashed during the recession since then it is often said there has been a profound shift in attitudes at the top of organisations the claim is that it is no longer possible as it often was in the past to justify an advertising budget by looking at what has been spent historically and adding a dollop for good measure there has been a permanent shift to below-the-line activity such as sales promotions while agencies are increasingly being called to account for their effectiveness the truth of these claims is largely borne out by a survey of the largest advertisers conducted jointly for the financial times and the institute of practitioners in advertising market researchers audience selection interviewed 156 chief executives finance directors and marketing directors about attitudes to advertising as well as wider marketing issues however while there has been a sharpening of scrutiny and more demand for accountability there appears to have been no weakening in the long-term importance of advertising the ipa concludes that despite advertising industry loss of self-confidence this study serves to reconfirm the value and status of effective advertising among mainstream advertisers forty-five per cent of the sample considered that advertising was becoming more important to their companies while a further 50 per cent thought there had been no change more than three-quarters of the sample disagreed that it was difficult to argue for an increased budget although half felt the pressure was always on ways to reduce spending levels over three-quarters agreed that the recession has taught us to question marketing spending more than we used to other findings include a move to setting advertising budgets on a task-related' basis in other words according to the job in hand rather than principally on historical precedent finance directors not surprisingly felt particularly strongly that this was how budgets should be set 66 per cent of them compared with 58 per cent of the overall sample said task was more important that precedent finance directors were a little more likely than respondents overall to view advertising as a cost rather than an investment almost universal agreement that highly creative advertising can add value to a brand and multiply the value of buying airtime and advertising space however there is dissatisfaction with measures used to judge the effectiveness of an advertising campaign 18 per cent of the sample and 26 per cent of finance directors felt their companies were not measuring effectiveness competently an unwillingness to worship at the advertising altar overall about a quarter rising to more than half of finance directors agreed with the statement that the advertising agency is just another supplier this is not particularly good news for advertising agencies that see themselves as partners with clients or hope to reinvent themselves as all-round marketing consultancies about two-thirds of the sample disagreed with the comment that some of the best marketing brains are to be found in advertising agencies confirmation of the growing power of retailers more than half agreed that retailers were becoming a more important focus for marketing activity than consumers rising to 61 per cent among marketing directors overwhelming agreement that advertising remains the best tool for long-term brand building below-the-line activity such as promotions was seen by two-thirds as more effective at generating short-term sales gains copies of the ft ipa survey are available free from the ipa 44 belgrave square london sw1x 8 qs
