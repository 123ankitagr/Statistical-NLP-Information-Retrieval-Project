People with Alzheimer 's disease show abnormal nerve fibers in the nose , a finding that may lead to a diagnostic test and a new avenue of research for finding a treatment , a study suggests . Nasal nerve tissue can be removed under local anesthetic , which may offer a way to study the brain disease early in its course , said researcher Barbara Talamo , director of the neurosciences program at Tufts Medical School in Boston . That could lead to the first definitive test for diagnosing Alzheimer 's in a living patient and allow studies of the disease in living nerve tissue , possibly giving hints for treatment , she said . Alzheimer 's experts familiar with the research are skeptical about prospects for a diagnostic test , but they agree that studying the nerve tissue may be useful . She described the new research in the British journal Nature with colleagues there and scientists from Harvard Medical School and the University of Pennsylvania Medical School . The new study focused on nerves found at the top of the nose within the inner lining , where they are responsible for detecting odors . The nerves extend threadlike projections into a portion of the brain that is affected by Alzheimer 's disease , Talamo said .
