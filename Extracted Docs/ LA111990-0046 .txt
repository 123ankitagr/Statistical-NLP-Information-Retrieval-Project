The oldest living person celebrated her 116th birthday on Sunday with hundreds of well-wishers , smiling and eating several slices of cake . Carrie White did n't seem to notice the greetings sent by Gov.-elect Lawton Chiles , or the recorded phone call from former President Ronald Reagan . Once the six-tiered cake was cut , she perked up . `` She 's wide awake now , '' Paul Allen , owner and administrator of Putnam Memorial Nursing Home , said as hundreds of well-wishers gathered around to watch her enjoy the cake . Reagan called about an hour before the festivities began on the lawn of the nursing home . His remarks were recorded and played back later for the guest of honor . `` I just want you to know there will be a prayer for you in my heart while I 'm in church , '' Reagan said . White was born in Gadsden County , Fla. , on Nov. 18 , 1874 . Ulysses S. Grant was President . The Guinness Book of Records identifies her as the oldest living person whose date of birth can be reliably authenticated .
