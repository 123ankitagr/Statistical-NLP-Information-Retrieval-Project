THE advertising industry is suffering from low profit margins , according to a report commissioned by the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising . In 1990 the combined billings of all IPA agencies was Pounds 4.06bn , while combined net profits totalled Pounds 50m . At the same time , there is still a widespread perception that advertising agencies are very profitable and pay their staff too much , the report finds . In its introduction Mr Peter Mead , president of the IPA and joint chairman of Abbot Mead Vickers , the advertising company , says : 'In some senses it is sad that we feel it is necessary to publish this document at all . ' He emphasises that trust and respect are being undermined by the false view that the advertising business paid itself too much and passed on the cost to its clients . 'Our business can make an enormous difference , ' he writes . 'It is not unreasonable to expect that we should make both a reasonable living and a fair profit for making that difference . ' The false impression of great wealth and profligacy has got about , the report argues , because of a surge of higher profits in the mid 1980s and 'the typical ad agency bravado ' which obscures the fact that advertising is a precarious , low-margin business , the report says . The average advertising employee earns Pounds 24,830 . The report also suggests that if public relations and marketing can argue for professional status , then advertising is in a strong position to claim similar recognition .
