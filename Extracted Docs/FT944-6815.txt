all rather odd sir donald gosling founder and major shareholder of national car parks and the venture capitalists who had planned to buy his company are off to lunch at the savoy on friday to celebrate the collapse of their pounds 650 m deal the occasion is the saints and sinners charity lunch is this a sly dig at venture capitalist prudential venture managers following its unwillingness to put up the last pounds 50 m alternatively maybe it is a belated recognition by gosling that ncp's second largest institutional shareholder is probably worth keeping happy interesting to see who picks up the champagne bill
