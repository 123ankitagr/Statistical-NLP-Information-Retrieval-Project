Oil was poured Wednesday into a dry fountain in front of the Exxon building in Manhattan , and a caller claiming responsibility said it was in retaliation for the company 's giant oil spill in Alaska . A caller identifying himself only as an Alaskan told the Associated Press that he and a fellow Alaskan had dumped 50 gallons of oil in the Exxon fountain , which has been under repair . The caller said the pair put the oil in the fountain so Exxon executives `` might feel a little closer to the story '' of the oil that spilled March 24 from the tanker Exxon Valdez and `` to protest that it 's taking a long time to clean up . '' `` It was a very small amount , and we 're cleaning it up , '' said Vince Silvestri , spokesman for the Rockefeller Center office complex . He said it appeared to be motor oil .
