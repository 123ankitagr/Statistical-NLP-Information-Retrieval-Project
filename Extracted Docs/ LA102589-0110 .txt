river trail stables in orange is as its name suggests a bucolic stones throw from the banks of the santa ana river 7 12 acres of treeshaded horse stalls bordered by a narrow bridle path that meanders beside the waterway flocks of nesting ducks terns and an occasional blue heron glide along the air currents above the marshy riverbed vincent the stable cat stretches out atop a weathered picnic table near the training ring this said river trail owner nancy shipley is our little haven our little country where you can almost forget youre in the middle of the hustle and bustle almost the rattles and clunks and roars from a nearby carpet foam factory provide a syncopated reminder of all that surrounds river trail stables after shipley bought river trail stables in 1985 an industrial park overtook the last of what was once orchards and fields and with the encroachment has come competition for the river trail itself our main problem is with bicycle riders shipley said the santa ana river marks the 28mile course for two bike and equestrian paths from the orange county line near green river golf course to the huntington beach shoreline for the most part the asphaltpaved bike path is some distance from the dirt bridle trail but right here the paths are together shipley said in fact the two paths converge at the end of the river bank many bike riders dont realize when a horse is walking quietly along the trail a sudden noise or movement can spook it especially from behind shipley said if a horse can see something they can pretty much handle it shipley said its the element of surprise that is so dangerous every rider at the stable has a horror story about cyclists she said one oftenrepeated story involves a cyclist who slapped the rump of a horse as he sped by the horse spooked and reared but the rider hung on one of the stables trainers who was along for the ride chased the cyclist and soon a posse of other riders on the trail joined the pursuit until the bicyclist was caught and told how nearly disastrous his prank had been sheepishly the cyclist returned and apologized to the shaken rider not all bicyclists are a problem families are usually very considerate shipley said but the serious spandexclad cyclists who use the trails for conditioning and to practice for racing events are another matter she added its not just my thinking shipley said we almost think there should be a speed limit some county workers charged with overseeing the trails agree that problems sometimes occur where the paths converge ive clocked some of them going 35 to 45 miles per hour with their heads down not watching where theyre going said ron broadbelt a county bike trail maintenance worker its crazy but a speed limit would be almost impossible to enforce broadbelt said a more practical solution would be to separate the trails a design plan that is part of the muchdelayed santa ana river flood control project terrie medeiros a project manager with the countys environmental management agency said the plan calls for widening the river near river trail stables and creating a new equestrian trail thats the only real solution said jean mcintire a county transportation planner who has been riding horses out of river trail stables for several years and has had her share of runins with cyclists but construction along this stretch of the riverbed isnt scheduled to start until april 1994 with completion of the area estimated at mid1995 in the meantime if cyclists could just not reach out slap the horses or shout shipley said then most riders in turn would try to keep their horses out of the way of the bikes
