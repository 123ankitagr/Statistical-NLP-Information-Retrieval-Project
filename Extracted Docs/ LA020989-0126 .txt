Japan announced it will pardon 30,000 people in a general amnesty that includes restoration of civil rights to about 11 million people . The amnesty , intended as a gift to the people to commemorate the death of Emperor Hirohito , will take effect Feb. 24 , the day of Hirohito 's funeral . The amnesty was immediately criticized as being selective and politically motivated because it includes thousands of politicians and campaign workers convicted of breaking election laws . The measure is in line with the Japanese tradition of granting pardons to mark significant events in the country 's history .
