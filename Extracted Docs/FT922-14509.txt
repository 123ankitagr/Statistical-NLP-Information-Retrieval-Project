THE NUMBER of prisoners held on remand in police cells has risen by 50 per cent since the end of January , when Mr Kenneth Baker , the home secretary , described the situation as 'unacceptable ' . Last Friday 1,846 prisoners were being held on remand in police cells in England and Wales , the highest number for more than six months and almost double the average daily total in 1991 .
