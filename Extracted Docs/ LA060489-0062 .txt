question i spend a lot each year for the chemicals to treat my swimming pool will those new no chemicals ionization pool purification systems really work and do they use much electricity answer an ionization pool water purification system can reduce the amount of chlorine and other chemicals you need by more than 90 it uses only several dollars worth of electricity per swimming season using minerals silver and copper to purify water is an ancient process even in extremely low concentrations silver kills bacteria copper in the same low concentrations stops the growth of algae the concentrations are lower than in many types of natural mineral drinking water an ionization water purifier uses two electrodes that are made primarily of copper and silver when a lowvoltage electrical current is passed between the electrodes copper and silver ions are given off into the swimming pool water there isnt any danger from this very low voltage you can easily install a purification unit yourself the special electrodes are housed in a small bowlshaped tank with inlet and outlet pipe flanges these attach to the piping outside your pool you will still need the filtering system to remove dirt you can wire it so that the purifier comes on when the pump starts the purification system has an electronic control unit that adjusts the concentration level of the copper and silver ions in the pool water you use a simple test kit included with the system to check the concentration level until you find the proper adjustment for your pool when you first install the ionization system you still have to use some chlorine and chemicals until the ion concentrations get to an adequate level then a couple of times each swimming season you should add some standard chemicals for a quick treatment of the pool water other than couple of cents per day for the electricity to operate the unit your only expense is the replacement of the electrodes about every three to five years they come in a set with new gaskets and you can replace them yourself you can write to me for utility bills update no 261 showing a product description sheet operating and water testing instructions and a list of manufacturers of ionization pool purification systems please include $ 1 and a selfaddressed envelope send your requests to james dulley co los angeles times 6906 royalgreen drive cincinnati ohio 45244 can air conditioner operate with timer q i put my window air conditioner in again i know it saves electricity to turn it off when i leave can i plug my air conditioner into the timer that i use for my lights and have it come on before i get home a your idea of using a timer to control your air conditioner is good it is similar to using an automatic setback furnace thermostat during the winter and it would cut your airconditioning costs however you shouldnt try to use a standard lightingtype of timer for an air conditioner the electricity drawn by an air conditioner even a small window unit is substantially more than for lights a timer for lights is usually not designed to handle that much electric current you will need to purchase a timer that is rated at least for a 15amp current load several companies make heavyduty electrical timers for air conditioner use check at a hardware home center or electrical dealer
