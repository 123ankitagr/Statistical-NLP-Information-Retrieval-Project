The nuclear industry has not cooperated with the federal government in tightening maintenance rules for nuclear power plants , the outgoing head of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said today . `` The nuclear industry should have been more cooperative with us and they were not , '' said Lando Zech , who steps down as NRC chairman Friday after a three-year term . Zech said the state of the nuclear industry as a whole is healthy , but added that he was `` somewhat disappointed '' to have made little progress on tightening maintenance standards . Zech said the nuclear industry , which has not applied to build a new nuclear plant in 11 years , faces an uncertain future . `` Nuclear power supplies 20 % of U.S. electricity needs safely now , but it 's impossible to say where we 're going , '' Zech said . `` I have no crystal ball . '' Zech will be replaced by NRC Commissioner Kenneth Carr .
