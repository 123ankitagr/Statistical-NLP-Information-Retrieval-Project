Production figures released by Toyota and Nissan yesterday suggest that the Japanese automotive sector is still mired in deep structural and cyclical difficulties . Nissan reported that domestic production in September fell compared with the previous year - the 27th successive monthly decline . Toyota , the stronger of the two companies , managed a modest 1 per cent increase in exports , while Nissan 's exports dropped by 5 per cent . The domestic Japanese market is suffering from prolonged contraction : vehicle output is set to be 10.6m this year , compared with a peak of 13.6m in 1990 . Abroad , the appreciation of the yen has hit Japanese manufacturers hard , forcing up the price of Japanese cars . In Europe , for example , Japanese car sales are set to fall 7 per cent this year despite a predicted 6 per cent growth in the market overall . In the US local manufacturers are benefiting most from the upturn . Japanese manufacturers have responded to the pressure by shifting production out of Japan to lower cost manufacturing locations . Honda 's announcement this week that it plans to double its capacity in Thailand is the latest example of this . In time , this strategy should restore the Japanese industry 's competitive position . But investors will find better recovery stories among America 's and Europe 's motor companies .
