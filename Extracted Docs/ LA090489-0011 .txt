floyd jackson is the only person who knows what it's like to be in my shoes brandon tartikoff president of nbc once joked the truth is since he opened his shoeshine business at nbc studios in burbank in 1951, jackson has worked on a lot of big shoes i used to shine bob hope flip wilson and dinah shore said jackson who over the years has decorated the walls of his shoeshine stand with pictures of some of his most famous customers after nearly 50 years of shining for the stars jackson himself has become something of a celebrity floyd's place is a regular stop on the nbc tour and a booklet chronicling jackson's career at nbc is available at the studio gift shop his regular clientele includes most of the guests who appear on the tonight show as well as the show's star johnny carson started in 1930 s now 80, jackson started shining shoes in the early 1930 s at the swank rice hotel in houston among his first celebrity customers was john wayne but many were texas millionaires such as former u s secretary of commerce jesse h jones or oilman glenn mccarthy whose life inspired the best-selling novel giant and the 1965 movie of the same title starring james dean elizabeth taylor and rock hudson it was mccarthy jackson said who in 1947 offered to bring him to los angeles aboard his private airplane the king of the wildcatters as mccarthy was known had just built the 21-million 18-story shamrock hotel in houston and was coming to hollywood to arrange for several movie stars to appear at the hotel's grand opening jackson said glenn was one of the biggest fellas in houston jackson said he liked me to be around him because i had a sense of humor jackson said he and his family had been planning to move to the west coast for awhile and soon after arriving he sent for his wife corine whose mother lived in los angeles for a few years jackson carried a portable shoeshine stand all over hollywood hunting down business i used to go around to all the studios warner bros mgm universal studios abc and nbc he said he also moonlighted as a custodian at universal a job he kept until 1971 stand at nbc eventually he saved enough money to buy a regular shine stand which nbc allowed him to set up rent-free on the loading dock of the company's old studios at hollywood and vine when nbc moved from hollywood to burbank in 1951, jackson went along today floyd's place is located outside studio one where the tonight show is taped one of the things floyd is famous for is shining the shoes of all the people who appear on the tonight show said nbc spokeswoman pat schultz it's become a good luck gesture for guests to have their shoes shined by floyd before appearing on the show the late night talk show's entire cast including carson are frequent customers jackson said johnny never comes out and gets his shine on the stand jackson said sometimes he'll be in makeup and i'll come in and he'll talk to me or i'll go down and pick up his shoes in his dressing room and he'll say howdy he's a good man 100 tip jackson's most famous customers have included former president ronald reagan and frank sinatra who several years ago gave the shoeshine operator his first 100 tip his second came last week from blues guitarist b b king one of jackson's favorite stories is about the 99 tip he got from spanish tenor placido domingo he was getting a shine and an nbc tour came by and told about frank giving me a 100, jackson said when placido got off the stand he said floyd give me a dollar so i gave him a dollar and he handed me a 100 bill the singer explained to jackson me and frank are very good friends and i don't want to out-tip frank jackson said his worst tipper was former president richard nixon who as vice president told his secret service escort to tip jackson 50 cents but jackson said he doesn't blame nixon i knew the vice president never carries money with him jackson said over the years jackson himself has appeared on television he said he has been on laugh-in real people and david letterman as well as the tonight show no stargazer in light of those experiences jackson said he is long past the stargazing stage and doesn't get excited at meeting celebrities but he has a warm place in his heart for those in the entertainment business show people are the greatest people on earth jackson said i just love them nbc executives say that over the years jackson's joviality has brightened the lives of studio employees floyd's an institution said donald zachary vice president of nbc's west coast operations he's always got a smile and a good word for everybody he's well loved besides zachary said nbc executives have the shiniest shoes in town although he retired officially last year jackson said he has had a hard time finding a reliable replacement he works whenever he feels like it nbc officials have promised jackson that when he leaves floyd's place will remain a regular stop on the studio tour i think about it and you know i never heard of a shine man being a star jackson said i'm not bragging about it but i made my own self a star
