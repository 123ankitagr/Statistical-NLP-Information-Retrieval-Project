It was a speech writer , a woman , who wrote the words `` kinder , gentler nation '' that helped propel George Bush into the White House . But it is another woman , his wife Barbara , who is giving force to the words . In her self-effacing way , this smart First Lady has probably scored more political points for the President than any superpower summit could . America loves leaders who poke fun at themselves . So when they said Barbara Bush looked like everybody 's grandmother ( including , some said unkindly , her husband 's ) she replied , `` My mail tells me that a lot of fat , white-haired , wrinkled ladies are tickled pink . '' Barbara Bush is not pushing the conventional boundaries of the First Lady 's role . She is comfortable with who she is , and she has a talent for putting others at ease , be it Raisa Gorbachev , who for her own domestic political reasons probably needed a low-key visit ; or the students of Wellesley , some of whom did n't want the President 's wife as commencement speaker . Mrs. Bush disarmed most of her Wellesley critics at Friday 's moving commencement ceremony by talking about respecting differences -- and by throwing in humorous references to cinematic bad boy Ferris Bueller . Sure , the First Lady , not surprisingly , is no rebel . But did she tip her hand ? `` Somewhere out there , '' she told the Wellesley graduates , `` ( there ) may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps and preside over the White House as the President 's spouse -- and I wish him well .
