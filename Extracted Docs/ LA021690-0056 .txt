Wildlife officials desperate to save migrating salmon and steelhead began firing rubber-tipped arrows at the sea lions responsible for decimating the fish runs through the Ballard Locks . Washington state Wildlife Department spokesman Bob Byrne said the arrows will fly at the locks weekday mornings through March . `` The goal of the rubber tips is to use this negative stimuli -- pain -- coupled with an underwater sound so that the sound becomes the negative stimuli , '' Byrne said . Byrne said the department 's goal is to save 1,600 fish in an expected run of 2,100 . But he said workers will be lucky to spare 900 .
