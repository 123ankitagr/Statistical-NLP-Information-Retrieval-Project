i read with interest itabari njeris article on racial relations an la cultural crucible may 2 i noted that the author used the term euroamerican when referring to whites rather than the inaccurate and possibly derogatory term anglo used often while euroamerican seemed initially unfamiliar and awkward as one of greekamerican descent i much prefer this term if i must be classified racially although euroamerican still leaves room for misrepresentation white people of middleeastern descent among others are still mischaracterized i feel the times should encourage the use of this term which more accurately allows for the ethnic diversity among the white residents of los angeles than does the latinocentric term anglo demetrios papanikolas brentwood
