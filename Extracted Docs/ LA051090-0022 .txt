i read with interest itabari njeri's article on racial relations an l a cultural crucible may 2 i noted that the author used the term euro-american when referring to whites rather than the inaccurate and possibly derogatory term anglo used often while euro-american seemed initially unfamiliar and awkward as one of greek-american descent i much prefer this term if i must be classified racially although euro-american still leaves room for misrepresentation white people of middle-eastern descent among others are still mischaracterized i feel the times should encourage the use of this term which more accurately allows for the ethnic diversity among the white residents of los angeles than does the latinocentric term anglo demetrios papanikolas brentwood
