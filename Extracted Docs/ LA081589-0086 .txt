A 12-inch natural gas line near a busy Arleta intersection was ruptured Monday by a Southern California Gas Co. crew , causing traffic to be temporarily rerouted , authorities said . The break occurred about 9 a.m. while workers were repairing the line at San Fernando Road and Branford Street , said gas company spokeswoman Sharon Bryant . Workers were able to shut valves to the gas line in about 30 minutes , Bryant said . Several firefighters were sent to the scene as a safety measure , but there were no injuries or evacuations , said Fire Department spokesman Greg Acevedo .
