i am emigrating to the us soon and subject to negotiation i intend to let my house which i own outright to my local council for three years under its private sector leasing psl scheme the councils guide to psl includes the statement if you intend to live outside the united kingdom in consultation with your solicitor you will need to appoint a power of attorney to look after your affairs the power of attorney will assume all the obligations and responsibilities of the owner while you are away this will include repairs and rent collection the quarterly cheque will be sent to the power of attorney to avoid deduction of tax under the income and corporation tax act 1988 will i be liable for tax on the rent i get what is entailed by having a power of attorney my sisterinlaw has agreed to act in this regard if i ask her to pay the rent into an offshore account held jointly by myself and my husband is this legal i dont want her to be charged tax on my behalf if the rent will be your only source of income in the uk after the end of the uk tax year in which you emigrate then it will be taxed here as though it were the only source of income of a ukresident married woman broadly speaking ask your tax office for the free booklet ir201992 residents and nonresidents liability to tax in the united kingdom the uks right to tax the rent is preserved by article 6 of the usuk double taxation convention if the rent is paid to your sisterinlaw she will indeed be assessed to uk tax on your behalf as your agent she can certainly pay the rent into an offshore bank account but she will want to be sure that you will always provide her with sufficient money to meet the tax demands on time as well as money to pay for repairs etc of course doubtless there is complete mutual trust between your sisterinlaw and yourself but she would be taking responsibility for your obligations and liabilities regardless of her ability to obtain reimbursement from you so it is not something which you should ask her to do without castiron guarantees that she will not end up out of pocket or in an embarrassing situation you might like to suggest that she consult a solicitor before deciding whether to accept the power of attorney which you are offering her and no doubt you will offer to meet the bill for her solicitors guidance as a first step you should talk to your own solicitor who will be able to give you general guidance on your overall prospective tax position etc as well as explaining the risks inherent in both granting and accepting a power of attorney no legal responsibility can be accepted by the financial times for the answers given in these columns all enquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible
