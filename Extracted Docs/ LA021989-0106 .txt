in my early marriage i had two miscarriages in the first at the first sign of something wrong my doctor rushed me to the hospital for a d c dilation and curettage and afterward i never questioned him further the second time at the first spotting my doctor instructed me to go to bed raise the foot of the bed and stay there until the danger passed one night i had a bearing-down urge i aborted my 3-month fetus i have read in your columns so many erroneous concepts of fetuses that i felt this letter was overdue my 3-month-old fetus was very definitely a baby with a large head and not fully formed fingers and toes it was unmistakably a male child when i finally had a successful pregnancy between 4 and 4 1 2 months i could feel the movement of my baby and the doctor could hear his heartbeat within 2 weeks he was definitely kicking and we could watch my stomach and follow his head as he turned over within me so how does one decide when it becomes murder to kill this baby lucille glassman westminster
