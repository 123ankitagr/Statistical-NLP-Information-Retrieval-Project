Police on Sunday said they had no clues to knife attacks on two pedestrians in Manhattan , one of whom was actress Viveca Lindfors . The Swedish-born Lindfors , 69 , suffered a facial wound that took 28 stitches but said she would not be intimidated by gangs . Dennis Beal , 36 , of New York was slashed just a few minutes earlier Saturday morning and within 3 blocks of the spot in Greenwich Village where Lindfors was attacked . Beal suffered cuts on his face that required 40 stitches . Police said they believed that a few marauding youths were responsible for the two slashings , but they drew a blank as to their identities .
