Sir , Your article headed 'Brunei default on debts alleged ' ( October 20 ) fails to highlight the fact that this matter concerning just Pounds 4,000 is within days of being settled . While there can be no adequate excuse for some of the delays which have occurred , it is not true to say that our promissory notes on behalf of students are 'worthless ' . We are unaware of any 'other debts in the United Kingdom ' which remain unsettled . Jaini Abdullah , first secretary , High Commission of Brunei Darussalam , 19 Belgrave Square , London SW1X 8PG
