mary is determined not to cry as she talks about hansen's disease but she keeps a box of tissues nearby just in case her condition commonly known as leprosy is not life-threatening when treated it is not contagious and has few visible symptoms if any but since the 53-year-old filipino immigrant's illness was diagnosed nearly two years ago she has discovered another common side effect fear of rejection that fear is the reason she lies to her co-workers at a san diego sporting goods company explaining away the small dark spots on her face and arms as allergies that same fear makes mary ask a reporter not to print her real name and keeps her from telling her sister who has a weak heart about her battle with a disease that fills most people with dread you become an outcast in the philippines you sure are one if you have this the tiny dark-haired woman said recently her delicate fingers folding and unfolding a tissue i have to tell a lie it's not that i am ashamed but i would like to protect my family nobody wants to have this mary is among a growing number of people nearly 160 in all who are fighting age-old stigmas at the regional hansen's disease center in pacific beach housed in the county's north san diego public health center the federally funded program is among 11 in the country established to care for hansen's patients many of them hispanic filipino or southeast asian immigrants and their families in the united states hansen's disease named for armauer hansen a norwegian physician who discovered its cause in 1873 remains quite rare only 6,000 of the world's 10 million known cases live in this country mainly in california florida hawaii louisiana new york and texas but in san diego as in other regional centers in los angeles and san francisco the influx of immigrants from mexico indochina and the philippines continues to cause the caseload to swell that expansion comes despite the fact that hansen's disease a bacterial infection that attacks the skin and nerves is often mistaken for other things from birthmarks to lupus because u s doctors rarely encounter the illness many are unfamiliar with its symptoms usually skin lesions and sensory loss as a result the average patient sees several doctors over about two years before getting an accurate diagnosis the san diego clinic has two goals in addition to providing medical care and counseling to patients in treatment the four-person staff tries to increase medical professionals index of suspicion about the disease so that new cases are detected sooner and although it can't change the world overnight the staff encourages patients to start by erasing the word leper from their own vocabularies leper is like nigger educated people should not use the word said dr d a lopez a dermatologist and associate clinical professor at ucsd who has provided care to the area's hansen's patients since 1974 it's a type of phobia that society has but the word does not describe the patient today today lopez explains the legendary deformities of hansen's disease are completely preventable only 5 of the population is susceptible in the first place and for those who do get it modern drugs can render the disease non-contagious eliminating the need to separate people from their families in colonies or leprosariums today lopez insists virtually the only things that prevent people with hansen's disease from leading normal lives are society's misconceptions and their own leprosy is not a threat to san diego said lopez a retired navy captain who first encountered the disease when he was assigned to the navy hospital in balboa park in reality there's nothing to fear from these people they're innocent victims caught between the germ and the body defenses their nerves get caught in the middle meredith a north county resident in her 70 s remembers how frightened she was the day she bumped her leg against the sharp corner of a piece of furniture and couldn't feel it born in the united states she was not a high-risk candidate for hansen's disease but she had recently been ill her weakened system was the perfect host for an opportunistic infection what's more over her lifetime she had lived off and on in an asian country where she had had contact with hansen's patients meredith who also asked that her real name not be revealed immediately suspected what doctors would later confirm but she caught her hansen's early started immediate treatment and avoided visible symptoms if you go to the clinic there's really nothing to worry about she says now in asia she recalled some people really did suffer open sores they couldn't walk their feet were bad but it never needs to get that way finding treatment is the first hurdle keeping a positive outlook throughout what can be years of treatment is another despite the medical breakthroughs that address the physical symptoms a diagnosis of hansen's takes a psychological toll some patients try to deny the problem quitting their medicines at the first sign of improvement others are tightly wound with fear carol frank the center's senior public health nurse remembers one man who was improving but for one thing at the clinic his blood pressure was always sky-high when measured at home however it was normal finally he admitted that visiting the clinic sent him into a tailspin he was terrified that he would run into someone he knew indeed some hansen's patients opt to keep the condition secret even from their spouses for them especially the clinic becomes a vital part of survival there they can share their frustrations with the medicines which often darken the skin they can air their guilt and anger or rehearse what to say to a loved one learning about hansen's for the first time as well as prescriptions frank makes sure the clinic dispenses plenty of physical affection from handshakes to hugs many hansen's patients feel unlovable betrayed by their bodies she explains especially those who have lost sensation usually in the hands and feet before treatment began we think pain is the enemy but they get no input their self-image is lost said lopez when sensation is gone it's a very lonely life hansen's disease does not cause parts of the body to fall off as many people believe but if not managed carefully it can have other harmful effects people with numbness in their extremities sometimes wear their shoes too tight causing sores they can't feel when their cigarettes burn too near their hands sometimes they pound their fingers with too much force causing a shortening of the bones to avoid these potentially crippling problems hansen's patients must overcome a natural tendency to regard their insensitive limbs as objects a phenomenon best illustrated by the story often repeated by hansen's specialists of a man who helped with the cooking in his village by sticking his hands into hot coals to retrieve potatoes that fell off the grill they were utensils to him they weren't his hands they were more like a shovel or a spade said frank people don't care about insensitive parts they have to learn to love a part they can't feel her advice to patients you have to look at your hands and feet as your babies that can't cry as well as maintaining a detailed regimen of self-examination regular clinic visits and hygiene patients must also learn how best to heal their psychic wounds and to brace for inevitable insults a few years ago for example one young patient at the clinic decided it would be best if he told his co-workers about his condition he was fired frank told him his employer's behavior was illegal but the young man refused to return opting instead to find another job efforts to debunk the myths surrounding hansen's disease are often thwarted by seemingly reputable sources in most editions of the bible for example the ghastly symptoms attributed to leprosy actually are a composite of a variety of diseases from fungal infections to psoriasis the hebrew word zara ath was translated leprosy long before the modern usage of the term had restricted it to a single specific disease what's worse the bible clearly suggests that leprosy is god's way of punishing sinners a belief that clinic workers find they must regularly refute this is a germ not the biblical disease frank has explained again and again but even for people of other faiths the stigma is powerful frank says one young cambodian boy refused treatment because he said that's how i'm supposed to be this is punishment for past wrongs frightening hollywood images depicted in film classics such as ben hur pitiable hammer-footed souls with their wounds wrapped in gauze don't help matters any neither do current movie previews like one airing now for the two jakes in which jack nicholson describes the secret to his success like this in this town i'm the leper with the most fingers one-liners like that make frank cringe for every off-hand remark she knows she will probably field scores of worried questions one woman whose daughter had sent her a handbag made by hansen's sufferers in africa called the clinic would she get sick she asked if she slung it over her shoulder an agitated businessman expressed alarm when he received a fund-raising appeal in his morning mail from a leprosarium in the philippines he wanted to know if he should he keep his staff from touching it frank's response don't panic though technically hansen's disease is an infectious condition more than 90 of the population couldn't get it if they tried especially not from a handbag research scientists speculate that the disease is probably transmitted much like tuberculosis through the upper respiratory tract doctors can also be ignorant lopez remembers completing his rounds one day in a san diego hospital afterward when he and his fellow physicians compared notes lopez told them he believed one patient they had seen had hansen's one doctor stood up got pale started perspiring and ran to wash his hands lopez said this kind of an impulse is automatic until we learn despite this ingrained prejudice lopez believes his patients will flourish if they fight the urge to retreat from the world he discourages all but the most ill from getting disability classifications that allow them to park in handicapped parking spaces he encourages them to take an active part in their own treatment and generally tries to squelch what he calls the poor me syndrome i want them to think of themselves as they would other people lopez said in that vein visitors to the clinic could probably take a lesson from one long-time patient a mexican man in his 30 s whose disease was diagnosed in 1982 i am a person who likes work life i say thank you for another day thank you that i can walk thank you that i can eat in my mind for me i feel strong he told frank in a tape-recorded interview i know this hansen's is very very strong and the problem for another person might be i can't do it but i can learn with being sick i can live with the hansen's for him the first step to healing was choosing his words the skin specialist doctor said your problem is hansen's he said i never used la lepra because it is not necessary with my problem to use that word a lot of people would say do you have la lepra ok i can't touch facts about hansen's disease known cases 10 million worldwide of those 6,000 live in the united states only 5 of the world population is susceptible earning hansen's the title of the least infectious of the infectious diseases in the u s most cases occur in foreign-born people symptoms sudden loss of feeling in hands or feet painful swelling or bumpiness of skin especially on the face hands and feet loss of eyelashes or outer edges of eyebrows earlobes swollen and turned out period between exposure and the onset of illness six months to 20 years there is no vaccine for hansen's disease and no test to determine if a person has been exposed however the disease is completely treatable with drug therapies myths and realities the myth hansen's disease is caused by eating spoiled fish by engaging too frequently in sex by drinking tainted water the reality hansen's disease is caused by mycobacterium leprae a bacterium that can infect the skin and nerves although it remains a mystery why some people are more susceptible to the disease scientists believe it is an opportunistic infection that takes root when a person's immune system is overloaded the myth hansen's disease is a scourge delivered upon sinners by god the reality in the bible the word leprosy is used to describe the symptoms of a variety of diseases a translation that has become outdated since the term now refers to a single specific disease scientists see no link between the illness and immoral behavior the myth hansen's disease causes parts of the body to fall off the reality the most troubling development if the disease goes untreated is a gradual numbing of the extremities which results in injuries sometimes going unnoticed injuries that become infected can lead to potentially crippling deformities but with care these deformities are preventable
