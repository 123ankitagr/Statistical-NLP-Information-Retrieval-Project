British Coal may be out of business by Christmas Eve but it still seems to have a few scores to settle . Gerard McCloskey , the editor of several Financial Times newsletters on coal , currently engaged in some acrimonious exchanges with RJB Mining , also seems to have upset Neil Clarke , British Coal 's outgoing chairman . McCloskey has been dropped from the guest list for British Coal 's last Christmas lunch for journalists . Come on lads , is n't it time to bury the hatchet ?
