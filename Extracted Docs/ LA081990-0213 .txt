question i must replace my old central air conditioner soon i want one that is superhighefficiency reliable and quiet what types of units are available to meet my needs answer there have been many recent significant improvements in residentialsized central air conditioners some of the new superhighefficiency central units have efficiencies called seer as high as 17 installing one of these can cut your cooling bills by more than 50 the most energyefficient central air conditioner uses a totally variable speed compressor and fan this allows the unit to operate at maximum efficiency for varying cooling needs and weather conditions on very hot days it operates at a higher speed than on cooler days an electronic microprocessor determines the most efficient operating speed since it doesnt cycle on and off as often the more steadystate operation improves the efficiency and your comfort the cooling output and air circulation are more constant throughout your home it also operates more quietly at the lower speeds central air conditioners with twospeed compressors are also available with seers up to 15 your old singlespeed air conditioner probably has a seer of only 6 to 7 another unit has a singlespeed compressor but a twospeed condenser fan to boost efficiency to more than 12 the scroll compressor design is now used in many of the superhighefficiency air conditioners its advantages are its quiet operation high efficiency and simplicity the noise levels from a scroll compressor can be 10 to 20 lower than from a standard reciprocating compressor with only a few moving parts a scroll compressor is less prone to mechanical and lubrication breakdown this makes it very reliable and it actually becomes more efficient the older it gets as it wears in when you select a central air conditioner it is important to have it properly sized your contractor should do a detailed heat gain analysis of your house and economic payback analysis for units of various efficiencies an oversized unit not only operates inefficiently by cycling on and off too often but it decreases the comfort level in all but the very hottest weather it wont run long enough to adequately dehumidify the air this is where the variable and multiplecompressors help you can write for utility bills update no 394 showing a buyers guide for 21 manufacturers of superhighefficiency central air conditioners listing models cooling capacities rated efficiencies sound levels types of compressors and numbers of speeds please include $ 125 and a businesssize return envelope send your requests to james dulley co los angeles times 6906 royalgreen drive cincinnati ohio 45244 should damper in fireplace be closed q i have a woodburning fireplace with a brick chimney on the west side of the house when i air condition in the summer should i close the chimney damper or leave it open for natural ventilation a if you are operating a central air conditioner you should keep the chimney damper closed the brick chimney holds the suns heat well into the evening this creates an upward draft and draws out cooled air if you dont air condition leave the chimney damper open the natural draft from the warm chimney draws cool outdoor air in the windows at night it is actually a form of free solar energy replacing an electric fan
