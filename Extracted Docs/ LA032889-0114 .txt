a massive oil spill that forced the closing of an alaskan port has california oil refiners bracing themselves for possible shortages of crude oil if shipments do not resume quickly say company officials if it stays closed for a couple of days it would disrupt supplies said chevron spokesman mike libbey several days of that and you will start seeing gasoline shortages on the street we dont anticipate any impact assuming that the port opens for tanker traffic shortly said arco spokesman al greenstein if valdez remains closed however thats a whole different ball game he said the shutdown of the port of valdez closed since late last week has drawn attention to how dependent california has become on alaskan crude oil california refineries rely on the states own reserves for about 60 of their supply of crude oil alaska accounts for nearly all of the remaining 40 about one out of three cars in california runs on gasoline refined from alaskas north slope crude according to arco there is a very delicate balance of supply and demand steve shelton president of the southern california service station assn it doesnt take much to knock it out of whack the california energy commission estimates that 20 million to 30 million barrels of alaskan oil are in transit to the state refineries which have another 20 million barrels in stock chevron refineries along the west coast including those in el segundo and richmond calif would gradually begin to cut back production if valdez remains shut down today libbey said industry officials say arco the states largest gasoline retailer is in a particularly tight spot since the recent temporary closure of a refinery in cherry point wash for maintenance has left it with a smaller reserve than normal arco estimates that its refinery in cherry point and one in el segundo have about a weeks supply of crude on hand arco has four tankers waiting outside of valdez said greenstein who also said the company might be able to tap into a tanker loaded with a shipment of oil owned by standard oil of ohio arco said the us coast guard is expected to open valdez today on a limited basis tankers will be allowed to enter and exit one at a time arco says despite arcos expectations industry officials said delivery schedules have already been interrupted it takes tankers about 24 hours to be filled at valdez and another six days to reach california ports say industry officials chevron said a tanker scheduled to arrive next week was still waiting outside of valdez monday and will probably be late however a chevron tanker that departed just before the port closed was expected to have unloaded in richmond early this morning california which consumes about 2 million barrels of oil daily is relatively isolated from other domestic sources of crude oil only two oil pipelines connect california with the rest of the nation and those pipes are designed to transport oil out of the state the lack of domestic connections might force california to turn to more expensive sources of foreign oil if valdez remains closed say industry analysts currently foreign imports mostly from indonesia make up only 5 of the states supply of crude oil according to state figures the west coast is essentially an energy island separated from the rest of the country said one industry official we have plenty of oil with supplies from alaska but without it thats when we have a problem nearly 40 of all crude oil refined in california comes from alaskas north slope nearly one of every three cars on california highways operates on gasoline refined from alaskan oil related stories part i
