The Orange Unified School District this week is expected to release a study showing that the district 's administration building is likely to collapse during a major earthquake , a district official said . `` Under normal , daily activity , the building is probably OK , '' said John Perry , assistant superintendent for business services . `` The danger would come in with an earthquake of high-magnitude proportions . '' District officials have long suspected that the office building at 370 N. Glassell St. in Orange might not withstand a large temblor , Perry said , noting that previous quakes have left cracks in the walls . Perry noted that the district is aware of structural problems and , in accordance with the state law , has posted signs throughout the unreinforced-masonry building that warn workers and visitors of the hazard . The engineer 's study will have the information the school board needs to determine whether the building is safe from a liability standpoint . The report is expected to conclude that moving to a new building would be cheaper than reinforcing the existing one .
