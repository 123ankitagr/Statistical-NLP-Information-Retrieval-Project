The body 's own defenses against disease can go awry and attack proteins that carry cholesterol through the body , triggering the dangerous buildup of artery-clogging deposits that causes heart attacks , researchers reported today . Dr. William Hollander of Boston University said his latest research supports the idea , which he pioneered two decades ago , that hardening of the arteries is an autoimmune disease -- the body 's misguided destruction of itself . `` I would say that our findings indicate that immune factors play a key role in the formation of the fibrous lesions that are the fundamental cause of heart attacks and strokes , '' Hollander said . Hollander 's theory has become a hot topic of research in recent years as doctors try to identify the forces that cause the blood vessels to fill up with fatty deposits like rust-encrusted pipes . This process , which doctors call atherosclerosis , results in a heart attack or stroke if a clot accidentally squeezes off the flow of blood entirely .
