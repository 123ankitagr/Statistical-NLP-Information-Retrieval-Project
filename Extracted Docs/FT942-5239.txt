solo travellers on the internet information highway are being overtaken by the digital equivalent of 16wheel juggernaut trucks as businesses begin to transport large quantities of data through cyberspace the system is being transformed into a global electronic marketplace that could change the way world trade is conducted the internet a global system of computer networks now links an estimated 22m computers and over 25m users in 137 countries new users are hooking up at the rate of about one every two minutes originally a us governmentfunded programme in the late 1960s to electronically link researchers at us universities and government laboratories the internet was in theory closed to commercial activity until about two years ago now companies are rushing to take advantage of the system as a lowcost route for international electronic mail computer companies have led the way digital equipment one of the heaviest users has over 31000 computers linked to internet and exchanges an average of 17m email messages per month with people outside the company to date however very little commerce is actually being transacted in cyberspace most companies have been reluctant to trust sensitive business data purchase orders or credit information to the unregulated network but that could be about to change a group of silicon valley companies and organisations has joined forces in an attempt to pioneer the use of the internet as a new medium for trade among high technology companies by creating an electronic marketplace called commercenet if successful this could revolutionise both regional and foreign trade says marty tenenbaum chief executive of enterprise integration technologies eit a research firm leading the development of commercenet together with stanford universitys center for information technology and the western research and educational network west ren a nonprofit group that operates the northern california portion of the internet the commercenet consortium is funded by a dollars 6m us government grant through the department of commerce technology reinvestment program which is being expanded by the clinton administration as part of its technology development policy the group will obtain matching funds from the companies state and local agencies that have agreed to sponsor the service commercenet is tackling the problems that have discouraged companies from using the internet for buying and selling goods and services notably the complexity of navigating the internet and lax security the first problem can be overcome with a new point and click interface program called mosaic developed by the national center for supercomputing applications ncsa at the university of illinois at urbanachampaign distributed free via the internet mosaic is rapidly gaining popularity as an easytouse method to gain access to information resources on the internet mosaic will enable companies to place virtual store fronts on the internet buyers can tap into these store fronts browse through catalogues of products which may include pictures diagrams and even video clips call up order forms and transmit their orders directly to the seller however security remains a serious concern for business users the public network is particularly vulnerable to computer crackers as demonstrated by a recent rash of password interceptions involving tens of thousands of internet users to address this problem eit is working with rsa data security the leading us encryption technology company to develop a secure version of mosaic commercenet will provide participants with authentication authorisation and data encryption programs so that buyers and sellers can safely exchange sensitive information such as credit card numbers and bid amounts sign legally enforceable contracts maintain audit trails and get paid through cooperating banks until such software is available commercenet participants will proceed cautiously most say they will provide online product catalogues and literature and enable orders to be placed via the internet for now however they will stop short of completing financial transactions nevertheless commercenet is an important testbed for commerce in cyberspace say participants we expect to gain valuable insights and experience concerning electronic commerce and to offer a broad range of business information and services via commercenet says peter meekin of dun bradstreet hewlettpackard and other manufacturing companies that are already using private networks for exchanging order information with their customers and suppliers see commercenet as a potentially cheaper alternative that could be used to expand their electronic selling activities it will be another mode of electronic commerce another tool in our tool kit says sandy whitson edi business manager at hp the company will move cautiously she says but is keen to explore the potential of public network electronic sales which could reach a broader range of customers than existing systems while commercenet is currently focused on businesstobusiness transactions within a tightlyknit group of about two dozen companies its founders have ambitious goals i believe that in two to three years you will see as many as 100000 companies using the internet as a principal sales and service channel says tenenbaum commercenet itself will be handling business transactions for as many as 3000 companies by the turn of the century he predicts business booms in cyberspace internet growth date hosts 1969 4 0471 23 1674 62 0377 111 0881 213
