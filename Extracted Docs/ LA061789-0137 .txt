the young woman rose lifted her hand and swore to tell the truth so help her god natashas always been my favorite name she told superior court commissioner julee robinson ok but why does she want to change her last name to lavery robinson wanted to know duke and anna lavery on general hospital is all the woman said as if it needed no further explanation the woman smiled robinson grinned courtroom spectators including many who also soon would be known by different names chuckled so ordered the commissioner said simultaneously killing off another unsatisfactory name patricia leanne watanabe and giving birth to a new one natasha lavery for reasons not altogether clear we have entered what appears to be orange countys prime namechanging season every year in department 3 of orange county superior court about 500 unhappily or unsuitably named people ask to be officially renamed during spring and summer name changes reach their peak its anyones guess why officials say that people may have more time to show up for court proceedings whatever the reasons motives can be rather straightforward for example michael scott vail petitioned the court this year to add the name merritt between his middle and last names to qualify as an heir under the will of his grandfather hewlitt c merritt sometimes the reasons are heartrending a santa ana woman asked to change the last name of her children ages 8 and 11 to that of their stepfather her reason they never see their real father who is serving a 100year prison sentence if you dont like your name you should change it advises leonard ashley english professor at brooklyn college and past president of the 1000member american name society a group of linguists literary historians and others fascinated with the etymology origin and meaning of names your name is part of your identity ashley said you know how annoyed you get when somebody forgets it or misspells it we even tip head waiters to remember it as a person grows up he might not like the script that has been selected for him he may not want to be a desmond there are these reputations that go with the names if youre running for the vice presidency you dont want to be a bambi tiffany kristine kern can relate to that on tuesday she will become djuna renee woods ive always hated tiffany since i was little she said its sweet frilly its charming nice pleasing im trying to get away from that im not a tiffany at all it just seems like daddys little girl its also a trendy name right now i dont know any other djuna kern appropriated her new names from her favorite female authors djuna barnes and renee vivien im an english major explained the uc irvine senior her new last name woods simply sounded good both my parents will be sad she conceded they spent a lot of time picking out my name i liked the idea of being able to name myself its really empowering im in the process of selfdiscovery im 24 my father i havent told him yet i thought id send him the legal ad clipping publicizing the court hearing im trying to be a strong feminist and intelligent selfsufficient she said now i just have to get used to calling myself djuna in some cases fathers thought they were bestowing the ultimate honor but obviously its tough to be a junior ashley said first of all you dont have a full individuality and you have a father to live down or up to both of these are difficult moreover while about 4 of the united states population is a junior 10 of the population of insane asylums and jails are juniors ashley said quoting from studies conducted in the 1970s if youre a john f kennedy jr you can have a great advantage but at the same time people are going to say to you youre no jack kennedy the surefire solution to being badly named according to ashley is simply to change it you can call yourself anything you want as long as it is not an attempt at fraud he said so you cant call yourself donald trump and go into the real estate business although it is commonplace and quite legal to change a name simply by using a new one many still seek the official imprimatur of court not everyone gets his wish last year garden grove city councilman robert f dinsen wanted to change his name to robert frank taxfighter bob dinsen but was turned down after a voter protested a superior court judge agreed that dinsens name change was an attempt to undermine a city ordinance saying in effect that taxfighter is not a permissible ballot designation under the state elections code in orange county it requires very little to change your name once you fill out the forms you file them in superior court where the woman in charge of name changes is charlotte hooker who by the way has no desire to change her name we see a lot of asians on behalf of their children about the time they start to school hooker said of families who are americanizing their names im sure it makes it easier for the kids to fit in once the forms are filed and notice has been published in local newspaper legal ads wouldbe name changers go before commissioner robinson most appear without attorneys said robinson who has been changing other peoples names for three years in some states you have to have a good reason to change your name she said adding that in california there must only be a good reason to prevent a name change the law requires a notification of a parent if the other parent wishes to change a childs name this allows protests at the hearing and you can find help without hiring an attorney tired of spelling venkataraman subrampaniam over the phone ask the publishers of nolo press a berkeley firm that bills itself as the largest selfhelp publisher of its kind for $ 1495 you can buy nolo press softcover book on how to change your name a 120page doityourself legal guide first published in 1974 and in its fourth edition people ask robin hood of laguna beach if he changed his name i think everyone wants to change his name as a kid especially if you are robin hood and everyone wants to know where friar tuck is and maid marian said the 43yearold chefs instructor at orange coast college but hood said he has been the sherwood forest heros namesake since birth and wouldnt think of changing it now he acknowledges however that his mother and father are mum on which one selected the moniker some of lynne marie deans friends laugh at her new name dean 24 of orange works as a movie extra and aspires to perform genuine acting where im myself and my roles are who i am real feeling and sensitive she needed a good stage name she decided to become sherah lee its a spiritual name that im using she explained i found shelah in the bible it didnt fit my friend said what about sherah the lee came from another friend my mother hates it dean conceded its like its demeaning or an insult but i didnt mean it that way the person who was brought into the world is not the same person i am now im not that little girl anymore sometime after settling on her new name dean learned there was a comic strip character named sherah no matter that her friends laugh she decided my mom and my aunt still call me lynn thats fine but to the world ill be sherah the name societys ashley feels a person is entitled to say this is my name and this is how i want it spelled and your friends should go along with that interestingly ashley has never been keen on his own name i dont like it my official name is leonard rn ashley i have lots of middle initials they name you after all your dead relatives and worse after all the living relatives who can leave you money by the way it doesnt work my relatives didnt know how to live or when to die so dont saddle your kid with a lot of names all my friends call me tim im certainly glad i didnt grow up like a leonard leonards are accountants and fussy and of course lenny is really stupid hes the big nerd in john steinbecks of mice and men ashley declines to take his own advice and change his name i have this great sense of family he said noting that his male ancestors have been anthonys and leonards for generations i dont have a son but i guess i would have to call him anthony or leonard its kind of hard to give up your roots whats in a name isabelle c benson became belle star after a divorce star who lives in laguna beach didnt want to use her maiden name of caestecker which she found too complicated linda ann meierhoefer became linda ann meyers her children had finished high school and it had been 10 years since her divorce so for this costa mesa woman the time seemed right besides she told the court there are now two other mrs meierhoefers alexander j reyes became sir james bond this westminster man had been known by the same name for all of his 34 years when he appeared in orange county superior court in 1982 to change it for personal reasons sunita became sunita kumar this indiaborn costa mesa woman had no last name to change theres no necessity to have a last name or a middle name in india she said but over here i have problems thats why i did that she added her husbands last name andrew sterna became andrew zaborowski became andrew sterna when he immigrated as a child this polishborn el toro man changed his last name to his stepfathers at the age of 37 zaborowski wants to change his name back to sterna his natural fathers family sentiment i
