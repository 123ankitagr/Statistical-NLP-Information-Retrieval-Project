Star TV , News Corporation 's Asian satellite television arm , is to change its business strategy radically in an attempt to broaden its appeal to Asian viewers . Mr Gary Davey , chief executive , said Star would change from being a broadcaster which attempted to lure the top 5 per cent of viewers in Asia to one which attracted the region 's growing middle class . Star currently has an estimated 200m viewers in Asia . To achieve this , Mr Davey said Star would change from a predominately English-language broadcaster to one that offered viewers programmes in their own language . He said the change reflected Star 's new management taking ' a fresh but realistic look at the market ' . Mr Davey , speaking at a media conference in Hong Kong , also foreshadowed the introduction of pay-TV on Star . He said Star was about to launch pay-TV channels , although he did not specify their number or type . Until recently it had been thought that the formidable problems of fee collection across the vast and varied terrain which Star covers would prevent the early introduction of pay-TV . Mr Davey underlined Star TV 's appreciation of the special cultural and political circumstances in which it was broadcasting . Star would 'pay greater attention to local needs , tastes and sensitivities , ' he said . 'In this region we fully recognise our responsibilities to cater to local needs . In a region with far greater political and cultural diversity than Europe , any broadcaster must be conscious of these sen-sitivities and operate accordingly . ' Earlier this week it was announced that the BBC would cease transmitting its World Service Television news on Star TV 's 'northern beam ' . This covers China , Mongolia , Hong Kong , Taiwan , Korea and Japan . Since his move to Hong Kong , Mr Rupert Murdoch , News Corp 's chairman , has sought to impress China 's Communist rulers and other Asian political leaders . He hopes that by sacking the BBC his cause may be served .
