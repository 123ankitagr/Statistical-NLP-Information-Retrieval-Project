I 'm filled with admiration for Rod Tompkins , the savings and loan officer who wrote Judge John Rhoades asking justice for Daniel Dierdorff ( `` S & L Official Pleads Against Lenient Dierdorff Sentence , '' Jan. 7 ) . I agree 100 % with Tompkins . I think there have been far too many judicial wrist slaps for business executives who 've broken laws , in contrast with tough sentences often given to such people as Tompkins ' teller who have not enjoyed exalted status . Aside from the merit of Tompkins ' views , I applaud his courage in making them known . I do n't think it takes any great courage to write pleas for leniency or character references -- unless the subject is Charles Manson . But it does take courage to ask the opposite for somebody who has been prominent , and who actually has been in the same field as the writer , particularly when what 's written may be publicized . I imagine Tompkins will be harshly criticized -- perhaps ostracized -- by some of his associates . I 'm sure , however , there are many who feel as I do , that he did what was right , and are glad he had the courage to do it . PAT HIGGINS El Cajon
