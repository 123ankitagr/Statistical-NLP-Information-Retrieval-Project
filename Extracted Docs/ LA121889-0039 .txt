Brooke Ward , the young leukemia patient who received a bone marrow transplant two years ago , died in her father 's arms while on the way to a hospital , authorities said . She was 8 years old . The surgery on Dec. 16 , 1987 , at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle , was the first such transplant for which a donor was found through the National Bone Marrow Donor Registry . The little girl 's widely publicized struggle brought recognition to the registry , and its list of donor names increased from 23,000 to 40,000 . Her doctor said her death Saturday was caused by graft-versus-host disease , a condition in which the body rejects transplanted tissue . `` They were really encouraged with Brooke since she had made it two years and had not relapsed , '' said the child 's mother , Marguerite Ward . `` It looked like just a matter of time and her body would accept the bone marrow . '' After a restless night , the girl 's father , Michael Ward , took her to the hospital but she died en route .
