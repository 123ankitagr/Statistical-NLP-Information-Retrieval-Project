Scientists report they have evidence that might explain why fish oil would be effective for treating diseases in which the immune system malfunctions , like rheumatoid arthritis . A fatty acid found in fish oil appears to suppress key immune system hormones , perhaps preventing the immune system from attacking the joints and other parts of the body in autoimmune diseases , the researchers found . `` We think we have the mechanism as to why this may work , '' said Dr. Charles Dinarello , a professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine who headed the research . In addition to apparently reducing the risk of heart disease , previous studies have suggested that substances in fish oil known as n-3 or omega-3 fatty acids appear effective in treating a variety of autoimmune diseases . In autoimmune diseases , such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis , the immune system apparently malfunctions , attacking the joints and skin respectively . In a new study published in the New England Journal of Medicine , Dinarello and his colleagues gave nine healthy volunteers commercially available fish oil concentrate for six weeks and measured the blood levels of substances known as interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor . The levels of the two substances , which are important hormones involved in causing inflammations , dropped sharply for up to 10 weeks after the supplementation , a finding the researchers called `` striking .
