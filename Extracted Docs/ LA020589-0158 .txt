A crowd of 14,687 packed the Orlando Arena for its basketball debut , but 20th-ranked Stanford spoiled the day by beating Florida , 84-69 . `` This is our first time on national TV , and to come into a place like this and win is great , '' Stanford Coach Mike Montgomery said . `` It is n't Florida 's home court , but it 's almost like it is . '' Todd Lichti led the Cardinal , scoring 27 points , 17 in the first half . Howard Wright added 17 for Stanford , including 10 during the final six minutes of the first half , when Stanford ( 16-5 ) jumped to a 44-33 lead . `` In the first half , I felt we really ran well , '' Montgomery said . `` Lichti shot the ball like he always seemed to -- right through the hoop . '' Florida ( 11-10 ) cut the lead to 60-52 midway through the second half on Clifford Lett 's 3-pointer . But Wright and Terry Taylor quickly stopped the rally , scoring all of Stanford 's 15 points in the next seven minutes as Stanford took its biggest lead , 75-58 . `` In the second half , we started off by missing some easy shots , but Florida did n't shoot well either , so that helped , '' Montgomery said . Florida , led by Livingston Chatman with 14 points and Dwayne Schintzius with 13 , had foul trouble . `` We did n't play well and they did , '' Florida Coach Norm Sloan said . `` We had some spurts , but every time we got something going , they would do something to take us out of it . It was their day and not ours . ''
