a crowd of 14687 packed the orlando arena for its basketball debut but 20thranked stanford spoiled the day by beating florida 8469 this is our first time on national tv and to come into a place like this and win is great stanford coach mike montgomery said it isnt floridas home court but its almost like it is todd lichti led the cardinal scoring 27 points 17 in the first half howard wright added 17 for stanford including 10 during the final six minutes of the first half when stanford 165 jumped to a 4433 lead in the first half i felt we really ran well montgomery said lichti shot the ball like he always seemed to right through the hoop florida 1110 cut the lead to 6052 midway through the second half on clifford letts 3pointer but wright and terry taylor quickly stopped the rally scoring all of stanfords 15 points in the next seven minutes as stanford took its biggest lead 7558 in the second half we started off by missing some easy shots but florida didnt shoot well either so that helped montgomery said florida led by livingston chatman with 14 points and dwayne schintzius with 13 had foul trouble we didnt play well and they did florida coach norm sloan said we had some spurts but every time we got something going they would do something to take us out of it it was their day and not ours
