Exxon 's top official in Alaska said that shorelines hit by the country 's worst oil spill were improving so well that he anticipated a minimal cleanup this summer . Otto Harrison , the Exxon Valdez oil spill cleanup general manager , told the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce that more work was needed on fewer than 50 miles of beach and perhaps only 24 miles . Neither state nor federal officials endorsed Harrison 's remarks and , in fact , said there was insufficient evidence to support the Exxon conclusions .
