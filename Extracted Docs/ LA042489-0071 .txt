Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : 'Illusory Thoughts ' and 'The Money Juggler ' United States , 1988 , 131 minutes 8:45 p.m. One good , one not-so . The weaker entry , `` Illusory Thoughts , '' shows writer-director-star Patrick Chu , a Hong Kong-born choreographer , as the pensive Nam , wandering around Manhattan , ruminating ruefully on how ephemeral life is , while various women fight over him . Leo Rubinfein 's `` The Money Juggler '' is a well-acted , well-shot , intelligent adaptation of a Louis Auchincloss short story.MICHAEL WILMINGTON
