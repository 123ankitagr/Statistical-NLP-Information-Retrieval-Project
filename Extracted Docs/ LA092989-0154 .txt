'' Yo , Bo , smile , '' said a young fan aiming a camera at Bo Jackson as the Kansas City Royals ' outfielder emerged from the dugout before a game at Anaheim Stadium . A crowd gathered as Jackson stepped into the batting cage . `` Bo knows batting practice , '' a fan shouted , mimicking the `` Bo knows . . . `` commercial as Jackson belted a pitch into the center-field bleachers . As Jackson , America 's most celebrated two-sport star , ran into the outfield to throw , a crowd gathered along the left-field line . When he teased the fans , pretending that he was about to toss a ball into the stands , hundreds of arms rose as one to catch it . Bo knows , all right . He knows how to work a crowd . Although it was a meaningless game between teams out of the running at the end of the season , the fans had come to see him . There were banners saluting him , one of which read : `` Bo Knows Ballet . '' Now , Bo may not know how to dance `` Swan Lake , '' but Bo knows baseball . . . and football . In his life as a Royal this season , he has hit 32 homers , driven in 105 runs and stolen 26 bases . Is this Jackson 's best baseball season ? `` I do n't know , '' Jackson said . `` That 's for you all to decide . '' And his life as a Raider ? After baseball season ends this weekend , Jackson plans to take a week off before reporting for the rest of the National Football League season . `` I 'm going to take my usual time that I 've taken off for the past 2 1/2 years , '' Jackson said . `` I 'm going to take a week and then I 'll report . '' Is it difficult to make the transition from baseball to football ? `` Nope , '' Jackson said . `` It 's what I 've been doing all of my life . So it 's easy for me . Next question . '' Raider Coach Mike Shanahan said he hoped Jackson would stop by Raider headquarters in El Segundo and pick up a playbook . So , did Jackson plan to visit the Raiders this trip ? `` Why should I ? '' Jackson said . `` I 'll deal with the Raiders when I get there . '' Has Jackson been following the Raiders ? `` I do n't get up every morning and go get the paper to see what the Raiders have done , '' he said . Does he think he can help revive the slow-starting Raiders , who have lost two of three games ? `` One man do n't make a team , '' Jackson said . `` I 'm just one of the guys on the team . Whatever I can do to help my team win , that 's what I do . I do n't try to go out and do more than I 'm capable of . '' Although his TV commercials are for cross-training athletic shoes , Jackson said he does n't train for football by lifting weights or doing extra running . `` I stay in football shape by running during baseball , '' Jackson said . `` I do n't have time to work out , because I play every day . `` I do n't get tired . There is nothing physical about sports , it 's all mental . If you can handle it upstairs , the rest is easy . There is nothing physical about what we do . You put it in your mind and go out and do it . `` After the first day ( of football practice ) my neck will be sore from the hitting . But after that it feels like I 've been out there for the whole season . '' Jackson said it 's no problem for him to play football without training camp . `` The other guys say they wish that they could miss that hot camp and come in and play , '' Jackson said . `` I would n't say camp is a waste of time . The younger guys need it to see what the NFL is all about . But the older guys . . . do n't . '' What does Bo think of Deion Sanders , who left the New York Yankees to play for the Atlanta Falcons ? `` I do n't ( think of Sanders ) , '' Jackson said . `` I have better things to do . '' Is Jackson a better baseball or football player now . `` I never knew I was that bad , '' he said . `` You get wiser after playing because you learn more about the games and you learn what the opponents are doing to try to stop you . '' Jackson has been bothered by minor injuries this season . He has pulled muscles in his left leg . `` He 's had a tough summer , '' Royal trainer Mickey Cobb said . `` He had some leg problems in the early summer and it 's carried over to late summer , but he 's getting along real good . '' So does playing football and baseball put too much stress on Jackson 's body ? `` We only have one person to gauge it on and that 's Bo , '' Cobb said . `` He seems to enjoy ( playing both games ) . But he may have an advantage because he does n't have to go through training camp and his body has not received the wear and tear that football offers it . `` I suppose a person would wonder if he were in shape enough to play football . All summer long he does a lot of running , and I would think he 's not in too bad a shape . '' There have been reports that Jackson is trying to save himself for football by curtailing his base-stealing . What say you , Bo ? `` Somebody told you a lie , '' Jackson said .
