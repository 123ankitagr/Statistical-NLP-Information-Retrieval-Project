Former Wisconsin football Coach John Jardine , who underwent a heart transplant last year , died this morning of heart failure . Jardine , 53 , who coached the Badgers from 1970 to 1977 , was admitted to University of Wisconsin Hospital on Wednesday after complaining of shortness of breath , hospital spokeswoman Lisa Brunette said . Jardine 's doctor determined that he was in heart failure , but said it was n't a rejection of his transplanted heart , Brunette said . Jardine had a heart transplant last June 16 at the hospital after it was determined he suffered from cardiomyopathy , a weakening of the heart muscle . He had been on a waiting list for a donor heart since December , 1988 . An autopsy will be performed , the hospital announced .
