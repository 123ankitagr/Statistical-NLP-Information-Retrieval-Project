Hungary today began dismantling a symbolic Iron Curtain that has divided Europe for four decades as it started to remove a barbed-wire fence on its border with Austria . `` With the dismantling of this barrier , an era with our relations with Western Europe and particularly Austria is closed , '' Interior Ministry official Andras Kovari told a news conference . The 20-year-old barbed-wire barrier replaced a mine field laid after the Communist takeover of Hungary in the late 1940s . The phrase `` Iron Curtain '' was coined by the late Winston Churchill , former British prime minister , in a 1946 speech discussing the dangers of Soviet expansionism . `` From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic , '' Churchill told an audience in Fulton , Mo. , `` an iron curtain has descended across the continent . '' Reformist Minister of State Imre Pozsgay said in October that the fence had become outdated historically , politically and technically . Dismantling began in the no-man's-land near this small town on the main road between Budapest and Vienna and at three other points , Koszeg , Sopron and Szentgotthard . Journalists watched as soldiers with sledgehammers disconnected the alarm system , lifted six-foot posts and rolled up wires .
