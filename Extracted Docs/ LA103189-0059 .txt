Commuters who sit in traffic every day on Villa Park Road soon may find the trip is easier . Villa Park officials plan to award a contract in November for a $ 1.2-million widening of the road into four and eventually six lanes , City Engineer Jeanette Peck said . Construction is expected to begin in January . The project will also include a median and permanent lights to replace blinking red lights where Villa Park intersects Center Drive and Lemon Street . An environmental report said noise on the road will increase only slightly , but traffic will be 12 feet closer to homes lining the route . Parking along the road will be eliminated when it becomes six lanes . Villa Park will receive about $ 50,000 from the state and $ 1 million in federal funds for the project .
