Zhores Medvedev , in his ( June 3 ) review of Dusko Doder 's and Louise Branson 's biography , `` Gorbachev : Heretic in the Kremlin , '' considers it unlikely that Gorbachev could have had an older brother who died during World War II . Even if Maria Panteleevna Gorbachev did not become a teen-age mother , she could have had a stepson . I presume that it is correct to refer to a half-brother some seven years one 's senior as just an `` older brother . '' However , I doubt that Gorby would care to write a Russian `` Roots '' to clarify the matter . KATHERYN GALLANT WEST COVINA
