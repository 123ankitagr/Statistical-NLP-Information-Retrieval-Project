this letter is in response to the dedication of an urban wildlife preserve in the sepulveda dam recreation area it would be interesting to know just how our city politicians decided to use taxpayers money on this project when there are many other more useful activities for this precious land it had long been rumored that a muchneeded golf course was destined for this location los angeles has a paltry seven 18hole courses which are usually poorly maintained the courses are the citys only moneymaking activities people spend hours each monday and tuesday morning trying to get starting times and pay their green fees the point is golf courses are in short supply and in huge demand and their revenue helps offset overhead expenses of the city that is indeed unique and desirable for all taxpayers how many people will visit a wildlife preserve that uses 60 acres of land and costs plenty to maintain without a nickel of revenue i hope someone with a sense of economic savvy will keep count and maybe in a short while this wildlife folly will be converted to a profitable golf course and to all the environmentalists who will be aroused by this view please remember that the natural terrain and the lakes and river bottom already in the area and outside the preserve attracted migrating birds and wildlife for years before some narrowminded politicos decided to build this preserve a richard apple chatsworth
