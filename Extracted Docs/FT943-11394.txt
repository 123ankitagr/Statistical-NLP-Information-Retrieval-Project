Sir , In your editorial , 'Flight plan for Air France ' ( July 25 ) , you argue that state aid to Air France should be tied to a deadline for the full privatisation of Air France . Why wait until after the provision of state aid ? As you rightly say , the lack of a market for shares in Air France makes it difficult to judge whether state aid is being granted on commercial terms . However , if Air France were privatised , the market could decide whether or not it was a sensible commercial decision to invest another FFr20bn in Air France . If it is a sensible commercial decision , then the funds could be raised on the markets ; if it is not , then the funds would not be forthcoming .
