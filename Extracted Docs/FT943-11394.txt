sir in your editorial flight plan for air france july 25 you argue that state aid to air france should be tied to a deadline for the full privatisation of air france why wait until after the provision of state aid as you rightly say the lack of a market for shares in air france makes it difficult to judge whether state aid is being granted on commercial terms however if air france were privatised the market could decide whether or not it was a sensible commercial decision to invest another ffr20bn in air france if it is a sensible commercial decision then the funds could be raised on the markets if it is not then the funds would not be forthcoming mike walker lexecon 3334 alfred place london wc1e 7dp
