Sir , Your report about funding packaging waste recovery was appropriately headed 'Recycling levy must fall on consumers ' ( April 14 ) . The text , however , also suggested this association called for ' a levy on retailers to help pay for recycling proposals ' . To avoid misunderstanding , may I make it clear that what we propose is a levy not on retailers as such but on packaged goods , collected at retailer point of sale . We believe this is the only point in the packaging chain at which a levy can be applied fairly to cover all forms of imported packaging as well as that originating in the UK . It is also the point at which the cost of waste recovery will be apparent to the consumer .
