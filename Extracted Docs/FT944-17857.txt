advertising can be its own worst enemy it makes exaggerated claims for its ability to build brands the result being that finance directors sometimes argue that any advertising campaign which fails to increase sales must be worthless why go on spending money they say on something that doesnt work andrew ehrenberg research professor of marketing at the south bank university business school in london wants to see claims for advertisings power toned down he is leading a twoyear research project on how advertising really works backed by more than 20 participants from industry in the uk and the us where he is visiting professor at the stern school new york university companies taking part include general motors cbs procter gamble british telecommunications prudential and shell ehrenberg and his colleague neil barnard argue in a paper on the project that views about advertising fall into three camps advertising as natural ingredient in the marketing mix virtually a fixed cost and assumed to be effective research and evaluation are often dismissed by this camp as fairly pointless this approach might have been just about tenable in the early days of marketing but in more accountable times is no longer acceptable advertising as an expense which is only justified when it pays for itself directly through increased sales the dominant position today this view of advertising as valid only when it is brand building is a reaction to the earlier unaccountable approach ehrenberg and barnard argue that the position is restrictive and leads to most advertising being classified as ineffective because in mature markets brands can not continually enjoy increased sales advertising as a way of maintaining sales of a brand this is the area on which ehrenberg and colleagues want to concentrate in their research project they argue that brand building may be the effect of advertising in certain restricted circumstances but simply keeping customers should be advertisings more modest aspiration the brand maintenance perspective is not new but the ehrenberg team claims it is neglected and underdeveloped little is known about how advertising works for established brands and they say that advertising planning is often based on misconceptions about consumer behaviour for example ehrenberg and barnard believe that the nature of brand loyalty among consumers is often misunderstood and considered to be a much stronger force than is actually the case your customers are mostly other peoples customers who occasionally buy you is a wellestablished principle of buying behaviour which they believe still surprises many advertising and marketing professionals to make their point about the comparative weakness of brand loyalty ehrenberg and barnard quote a study of the instant coffee market in the us this found that the average brand was bought three times a year by its customers while those same customers bought instant coffee nine times a year on average in other words the average brand accounted for just one third of its customers instant coffee requirements loyalty is nothing more than a propensity to buy a product they say ehrenberg says that deflating some of the more exaggerated claims for advertising and greater understanding of consumer purchasing behaviour should leave advertising more accountable and therefore in a stronger position to justify its existence
