this is in response to the plight of sos center in costa mesa by sylvia easton and others letters jan 14 easton and others in other articles accuses costa mesa of cruelty and greed that simply is not true the problem is the number of people sos brings to a residential area of costa mesa causing distress to the residents this was not a problem when the organization was smaller and would not be a problem if the number of people attracted to the organization in this area was reduced i suggest a solution the rest of the 29 cities in orange county should each open a branch of sos surely if as easton suggests many of irvine's homeless have been assisted by sos irvine should not be reluctant in participating in such a humane activity besides why should the homeless of other cities have to go all the way to costa mesa to obtain aid it seems to me that easton as chair of irvine task force for the homeless should be in an excellent position to assist sos in opening a branch office it is unfortunate that her only option seems to be in browbeating a costa mesa neighborhood into accepting the responsibility of other cities dean h hicks costa mesa
