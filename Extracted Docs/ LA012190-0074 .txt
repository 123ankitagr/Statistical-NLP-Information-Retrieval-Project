This is in response to `` The Plight of SOS Center in Costa Mesa '' by Sylvia Easton and others ( Letters , Jan. 14 ) . Easton ( and others in other articles ) accuses Costa Mesa of cruelty and greed . That simply is not true . The problem is the number of people SOS brings to a residential area of Costa Mesa , causing distress to the residents . This was not a problem when the organization was smaller and would not be a problem if the number of people attracted to the organization in this area was reduced . I suggest a solution : The rest of the 29 cities in Orange County should each open a branch of SOS . Surely , if , as Easton suggests , many of Irvine 's homeless have been assisted by SOS , Irvine should not be reluctant in participating in such a humane activity . Besides , why should the homeless of other cities have to go all the way to Costa Mesa to obtain aid ? It seems to me that Easton , as chair of Irvine Task Force for the Homeless , should be in an excellent position to assist SOS in opening a branch office . It is unfortunate that her only option seems to be in browbeating a Costa Mesa neighborhood into accepting the responsibility of other cities . DEAN H. HICKS Costa Mesa
