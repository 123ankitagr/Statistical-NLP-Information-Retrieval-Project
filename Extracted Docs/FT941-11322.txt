the struggle for supremacy in the fastchanging multimedia business in canada has intensified with rogers communications proposing a strategic merger with maclean hunter the outcome of what appears to be an unfolding battle for control of mh is likely to be decided only partly by what is good for each companys shareholders canadians can also expect to be bombarded over the next few weeks with opinions about how best to preserve some of their most treasured cultural icons ranging from macleans canadian answer to time magazine to a string of radio and television stations other weighty public policy issues will loom large in what rogers is billing as canadas opportunity to create a company able to stand up to the muscle of such global multimedia behemoths as time warner news corporation and bertelsmann rogers proposal is certain to spark a debate about the relative merits of concentration of ownership versus economies of scale in the media and cabletv businesses if foreign partners or predators become involved in the fray as some analysts predict canadians will also be confronted with the vexing question of foreign involvement in the institutions which help define the differences between themselves and their southern neighbours rogers is expected to unveil details of its offer following a board meeting in toronto this afternoon it has already bought 83 per cent of mhs 210m shares on the open market to finance the cash part of its offer rogers has cdollars 700m usdollars 5263m in cash on hand and is arranging credit lines of cdollars 2bn it has indicated it will also include a parcel of its own nonvoting shares in the bid mhs share price has shot up in anticipation of the offer boosting its market capitalisation in the past two days from cdollars 285bn to about cdollars 35bn mhs us cabletelevision franchises in new jersey michigan and florida are alone estimated to be worth between dollars 15bn and dollars 2bn these assets could play a decisive role in the looming battle mr ted rogers founder controlling shareholder and chief executive of the company which carries his name says if his bid succeeds he will sell the franchises to help pay down debt however mh said this week it had hired goldman sachs to explore the possibility of selling the cabletv assets itself with the objective of protecting and enhancing shareholder value with an eye on the political ramifications of the deal mr rogers wrapped himself in a figurative maple leaf when he unveiled his plans late on wednesday the aim of the strategic merger he said was to create a dynamic new canadian multimedia company where the whole is obviously far stronger than the parts the two companies combined have annual revenues of about cdollars 3bn their cabletv systems cover more than 3m subscribers and between them own 32 radio stations and a number of tv outlets mh publishes about 250 magazines and trade journals and owns 62 per cent of the toronto sun mr rogers claimed a merger between rogers and mh would act as a counterweight to canadas powerful telephone companies as the lines between communications media and entertainment become increasingly blurred he already has a minority stake in unitel which is trying to break the established phone companies iron grip on the longdistance market mr rogers held out the prospect of lower cabletv fees as the two companies combined and rationalised their canadian operations their cable systems make up more than a third of the total market and several are contiguous mh has so far reacted with typical caution to the approaches it has noted that numerous regulatory approvals will be required its board will consider the proposal in light of its other strategic alternatives and with a view to the best interests of mh and its shareholders the question is already being raised as to whether a rocksolid repository of canadian culture like maclean hunter should be allowed to fall into the hands of a restless entrepreneur like mr ted rogers a columnist wrote in yesterdays globe mail newspaper it is hard to see what highlyindebted rogers is bringing to the table aside from yet another bridging loan from its patient bankers why could not maclean hunter reshape its own future or turn around and swallow mr rogers whole
