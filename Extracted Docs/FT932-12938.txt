The US administration seems to be causing no little irritation in Tokyo with its apparent attempt to talk up the yen . Having delivered a stimulus to the Japanese economy which was larger than expected , the government had hoped that US officials might ease off on trade . Instead , it seems that some of Mr Clinton 's advisers believe that the strengthening yen has prompted a drop in Japanese car sales in the US . They hope that any further appreciation will hit other Japanese exports . Either the Japanese make trade concessions or the US allows a strong yen to do its work for it . So far , Bank of Japan intervention has managed to hold the the line at Y110 to the dollar . Still , the pain is being felt . Japanese exporters are making some efforts to reduce costs , but deep cuts have been avoided , and companies are loath to give up cosy labour practices . While the currency has not moved as sharply as it did in 1986 , Japanese companies are starting with much weaker balance sheets . Lower cost Asian manufacturing centres such as Taiwan and even China are now producing high-quality textiles and commodity electronics which are displacing Japanese goods . A strong currency is a significant brake on the stock market 's recent run . It remains unclear whether a rising yen is the right prescription to solve the trade problem . The imbalance is caused more by a collapse in Japanese demand than by an export surge . Further cuts in the Japanese discount rate might have more effect - always supposing that US exporters can take advantage of any recovery in the domestic Japanese economy .
