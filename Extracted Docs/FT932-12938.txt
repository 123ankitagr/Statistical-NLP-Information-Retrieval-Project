the us administration seems to be causing no little irritation in tokyo with its apparent attempt to talk up the yen having delivered a stimulus to the japanese economy which was larger than expected the government had hoped that us officials might ease off on trade instead it seems that some of mr clinton's advisers believe that the strengthening yen has prompted a drop in japanese car sales in the us they hope that any further appreciation will hit other japanese exports either the japanese make trade concessions or the us allows a strong yen to do its work for it so far bank of japan intervention has managed to hold the the line at y110 to the dollar still the pain is being felt japanese exporters are making some efforts to reduce costs but deep cuts have been avoided and companies are loath to give up cosy labour practices while the currency has not moved as sharply as it did in 1986, japanese companies are starting with much weaker balance sheets lower cost asian manufacturing centres such as taiwan and even china are now producing high-quality textiles and commodity electronics which are displacing japanese goods a strong currency is a significant brake on the stock market's recent run it remains unclear whether a rising yen is the right prescription to solve the trade problem the imbalance is caused more by a collapse in japanese demand than by an export surge further cuts in the japanese discount rate might have more effect always supposing that us exporters can take advantage of any recovery in the domestic japanese economy
