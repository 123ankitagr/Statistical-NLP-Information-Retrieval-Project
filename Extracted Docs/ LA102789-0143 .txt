a new costa mesa police policy allows people caught with outstanding misdemeanor warrants to get a warning rather than a trip to jail a top police official said thursday under a policy adopted by the department only people who received a warrant for skipping an appearance in harbor municipal court will get hauled off to see the judge police capt tom lazar said all others are simply warned to clear up their warrants and set free unless officers from the department that originally arrested them want to come and get them without the change of policy it was quietly instituted about two months ago costa mesa officers would have to drive prisoners wanted for violations in other jurisdictions directly to county jail sharply reducing patrol time lazar said for years costa mesa officers avoided the drive and wait at the central jail by simply dropping off warrant violators at harbor court there all of those whose warrants were issued in other municipal courts would be held in a marshal's lockup to await a sheriff's bus for a ride to jail but during the summer the sheriff's department stopped providing the bus service for warrant violators sheriff's lt richard j olson said the service was stopped because the prisoners would have to wait hours before receiving medical checks upon their arrival at the main jail without the checks the sheriff's department could be exposed to legal liability if a prisoner were later found to be seriously ill or injured harbor court handles cases originating in costa mesa newport beach and irvine chris woodyard
