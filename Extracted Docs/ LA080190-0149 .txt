The young actress who played Kate McArdle 's daughter on the defunct `` Kate & Allie '' TV sitcom is now an attractive adult actress , but she 's still playing teen-agers . Ari Meyers is 21 now and co-starring in the new movie thriller `` Shackma '' with Chris Atkins and Roddy McDowall . Because she is tiny ( 5-foot-2 ) and looks a half-dozen years younger than she is , Meyers plays a 17-year-old in `` Shackma , '' and a teenager in `` My Name is Anna , '' playing the young Patty Duke in a TV film version of Duke 's autobiography . She also is starring at Yale University , where she is in her senior year , following in the footsteps of such other academically minded actresses as Brooke Shields , Jody Foster and Jennifer Beals . Looking back on `` Kate & Allie , '' Meyers says she enjoyed the experience , but is too busy to regret not having an acting job to report to five days a week . `` I loved doing the show , but I also enjoy doing TV movies and feature films now , '' she said . `` I 'm able to attend classes full-time , which I would n't have been able to do if I had gone right into another series . `` I think of 'Kate & Allie ' as one of the things I 've done as an actress , not as THE highlight of my career . `` It was a wonderful experience . It enabled me to go to high school in Manhattan and have a 9-to-5 job that did n't take me away from New York , where I was born and raised . ''
