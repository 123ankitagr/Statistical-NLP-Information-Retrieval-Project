question my college roommate recently went to her doctor for an examination and he found a small mass in her breast i don't know if the doctor was just trying to make my roommate feel better but he was very reassuring about the future and said he was not even going to refer her for a biopsy i realize you can't give an educated opinion about a specific hypothetical situation but don't you think that the doctor is treating the entire situation a little too lightly answer as you say i have absolutely no way of evaluating the physician's approach to the problem you present since you are college students i assume you and your roommate are in the 18 to 22 age range and breast cancer is rare in women under age 30 in one study researchers from emery university school of medicine in atlanta reviewed a number of breast biopsy records no cancer was found in the 178 patients who were under 20 years of age and only two cancers were found in the 150 patients who were 21 to 25 years old this low incidence of cancer in young women may account for the conservative approach being taken by your roommate's physician
