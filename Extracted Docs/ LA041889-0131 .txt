Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : 'La Gran Fiesta ' Puerto Rico , 1986 , 100 minutes 7:15 p.m. San Juan 's most prestigious casino and social club is the site of a last grand ball before it is converted into a U.S. military facility for the duration of World War II . Francoites and liberals dance and mingle and , under the glittering surface , intrigues , double-crosses , and heartbreaks percolate and pop . This first film by Marcos Zurinaga ( `` Tango Bar '' ) is a lesser effort . Zurinaga skimps on his specialties -- musical numbers and eye and body english -- and , though we need a Fitzgeraldian bittersweet opulence , gives us something drier , thinner , more like Edna Ferber .
