Newcastle United will be the only English Premier League club where some fans will stand on terraces next season . Mr Peter Brooke , national heritage secretary , said yesterday that he had given a year 's extension to Newcastle United after it 'presented a sufficiently exceptional case ' . But he confirmed his decision not to grant extra time to Barnsley , Chelsea , Manchester City , Oldham or Swindon . All premier league and first division clubs were given until this summer to convert their stadiums to all-seater following the 1989 Hillsborough disaster .
