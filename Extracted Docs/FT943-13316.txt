a yawning gap has opened up between what is actually happening to german broad money and what ought to be happening a similar gulf has appeared between how the bundesbank is supposed to respond and how it is actually responding when on thursday it puts forward its revision to this year's target it needs a good story if it fails to provide one its credibility may be damaged fortunately by june the annualised rate of m3 growth above the average of the fourth quarter of 1993 was only 11.3 per cent down from 15.4 per cent two months before even so growth was almost double the 4-6 per cent target range for 1994 if the target is to be met there must be no further monetary growth this year which seems highly unlikely even though m3 has been stagnant since april missing monetary targets has become a habit goldman sachs forecasts that m3 will end up having increased at an annual rate of nearly 9 per cent between 1991 and 1994 since an inflation-neutral rate would be some 5 1 2 per cent it also argues that this augurs a renewed rise in inflation even though monetary growth has been bounding ahead the bundesbank has continued to cut interest rates since the autumn of 1992, the repurchase or repo rate has been cut from 8.9 per cent to 4.91 per cent with a reduction of 1.09 percentage points this year the policy has been one of modest but frequent rate reductions as inflation has continued its downward path from almost 5 per cent in early 1992, to 3 per cent in the year to june 1994 asset growth how has the supposedly monetarist bundesbank justified what it has been doing its principal appeal on the overshooting has been to temporary factors the most important of which was the unwillingness of depositors to hold illiquid bank deposits not included in m3 rather than liquid ones lower short-term rates will it argues encourage investors to shift towards longer term deposits this argument is valid but only up to a point total monetary assets which include illiquid deposits have been growing at around 8 1 2 per cent year-on-year more serious still lending to domestic non-banks grew by 10 per cent in the year to april 1994, while that to the public sector rose 13 per cent the benefits of lower interest rates on the composition of deposits could be more than offset by accelerated expansion of the total as lending takes off the bundesbank has six options argues merrill lynch to leave the target unchanged but explain the overshoot away to increase the target to abandon m3 for another aggregate to abandon monetary targeting to extend the current target range until end-1995 or to announce that the growth rates for next year will be based not on the outcome but on the upper bound to this year's target attractive alternative the first is the most likely but perhaps the least satisfactory since it would render policy utterly obscure raising the target substantially would be almost equivalent to abandoning it meanwhile the most attractive alternative definition of money in terms of its recent performance would be one that included illiquid deposits the question however is whether these are relevant components of liquidity as to abandoning targeting this is what has happened almost everywhere else but such abandonment could be justified only if the bundesbank were certain m3 does not mean what it has long claimed it does the evidence so far would not support that proposition for the moment therefore the ideal mixture of pragmatism with rigour is to be found in the last two options either way any excess liquidity this year would have to be mopped up in 1995 the bundesbank was right to put m3 to one side while the economy was in deep recession and inflation was falling but it should try to keep the growth of m3 in line with historical experience of the demand for money at least until that policy has become demonstrably wrong the worst of all options would be to insist on a target whose overshooting is ignored the bundesbank is a far more pragmatic institution than its critics admit but it should not be as pragmatic as that
