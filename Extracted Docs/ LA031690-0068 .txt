Rauf Denktash resigned as president of the breakaway Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus to clear the way for early elections that he said will be a referendum on the divided island 's future . Presidential elections will be held April 22 and parliamentary elections May 6 . Denktash complained that some Turkish Cypriot politicians have accused him of being too uncompromising in talks on reunifying Cyprus . The latest round of U.N.-sponsored talks collapsed earlier this month over Turkish Cypriot demands for self-determination . Cyprus has been split into northern Turkish and southern Greek sectors since 1974 .
