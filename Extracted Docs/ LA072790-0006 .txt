The many assumptions that esteemed British historian Paul Johnson ( `` Destiny Derailed , Then Triumphant , '' Commentary , July 16 ) tries to push over on us as historical fact are too numerous to discount here . And , his statement that the U.S. Constitution is `` idealistic '' and `` impossible for a President to observe it in the spirit and the letter , and at the same time , protect America 's interests in a wicked world '' comes across as a feeble attempt to picture Richard Nixon as a victim of a `` public witch hunt '' and Watergate as a `` forgotten footnote . '' But , Johnson is a propagandist here , because he commits three cardinal sins of the historian . First , he boldly declares what would have happened `` if '' by arguing that the Soviet Empire would have collapsed `` several years earlier '' if Nixon had not been a victim of a Democratic Congress . Second , he asserts that the American people were of one mind by opining that the `` support they gave Reagan was their way of signifying , without actually admitting , that they owed Nixon an apology . '' Third , he declares Reagan `` deserves credit for bringing the Cold War to a successful conclusion . '' Johnson knows better than to give a development such as the sweeping changes in the Soviet Union a simple , single-causation image . History demands a period of 10 to 20 years to provide the perspective to understand its many causes and effects . What is going on in Gorbachev 's Russia is not history yet but current events . Only time can reveal to us what has both caused it and what its full significance will be . It is perfectly acceptable for the historian to include his political bias into his interpretation of events . But it is shameful for the propagandist to present his biased views of history .
