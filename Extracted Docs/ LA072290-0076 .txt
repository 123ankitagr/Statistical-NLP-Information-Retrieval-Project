a culver city discount electronics store stung by a major distributors accusations that it was trying to pass off refurbished goods as new struck back at its accuser with a sting of its own star club a discount shop on sepulveda boulevard has sued canon usa inc the american distributor of products by canon the japanese maker of photographic video and office equipment to bolster their contention that authorized canon dealers were disseminating what they say are unfounded allegations against star club owner aviv mizrahi and his brother alon mounted an impromptu sting operation they posed as customers at competing stores and using a floormodel camcorder videotaped the proceedings one tape they submitted to a judge shows a canon sales representative repeating the accusations on the basis of the tape and other information the brothers obtained a los angeles superior court order last august barring further dissemination of the allegations made in a letter from a canon regional sales manager according to court documents and the attorneys involved it was in july 1989 that the canon manager wrote to several authorized canon dealers that star club was selling as new video cameras that had been refurbished and were not covered by canons us warranty allegations that star club denies the letter from glenn scharaga video division sales manager for canons western states region said this had been discovered from a tracing of camcorder serial numbers please advise your customers not to purchase these units from star club which is not an authorized canon retailer scharaga wrote when the mizrahi brothers heard about the letter from comparisonshopping customers they went shopping themselves having learned from an advertisement that a canon sales representative would be on hand to show off some canon products aviv and alon mizrahi went to audio video city in culver city as one of the brothers worked a demonstration canon camcorder the other discussed camcorder prices with sales representative russ avisson and mentioned that the same model at star club cost a couple hundred dollars less and was backed by a good warranty thats not an authorized dealer and hes selling open refurbished goods the videotape shows avisson replying they audio video city are not going to match prices with that thats like buying a brand new cadillac and then coming back and saying i found a cadillac for half the price but its four years old and its got 100000 miles avisson referred to a copy of scharagas letter that was on display canon does not even honor star clubs warranty he told the mizrahis the sting operation was repeated at four other authorized canon retailers three on the westside and one in the san fernando valley alon mizrahi said in each shop scharagas letter framed was sitting on the sales counter mizrahi said star club filed its suit seeking unspecified damages in august charging canon scharaga avisson and the authorized dealers with unfair competition libel slander interference with its business and antitrust violations a trial is expected this fall in los angeles superior court meanwhile star club is drumming up attention to its cause it played the sting video on bigscreen tvs at a news conference earlier this month at the store which drew among others a japanese television station and newspaper loyal customers stood by for interviews its just a publicity stunt canons attorney carl w shapiro said of the news conference i need to clear my name aviv mizrahi said star club sees the situation as nothing less than a campaign by canon to eliminate it as a competitor to canons authorized dealers the 5yearold store which sells below manufacturers suggested retail prices and will not quote prices over the telephone is a real force in the retail market here star club attorney paul h rochmes said if i sell at a volume basis i believe i will be able to sell at a heck of a lot less than the manufacturers suggested price aviv mizrahi said in an interview if i would decide to make less profit its my business why would a major japanese company like canon pick on me canon attorney shapiro insisted that there was no vendetta against star club plenty of retailers sell at discount he noted canon believes that authorized dealers are able to provide better services and support to customers he said but canon as a company does not go out and attack unauthorized dealers this is an isolated incident by a local sales manager shapiro said and only when star club filed suit did canons headquarters learn of scharagas letter this is one of those things you dont anticipate happening shapiro said canon would have preferred if scharaga would have checked with someone before he sent the letter the regional sales manager as well as sales representative avisson have been counseled but they remain in their positions at canon shapiro said scharaga at canons offices in costa mesa declined to comment other than to read a statement issued by canon headquarters in new york the employee involved and the person who wrote the letter acted on information they believed to be accurate without admitting or denying the allegations such alleged behavior by its employees has never been approved by canon management and would never be condoned as for the video shapiro said the star club representatives goaded the people into making statements star club says its reputation has been sullied and the lawsuit alleges that the resulting loss of sales and profits exceeds $ 25000 although he insisted that sales have suffered at the store star club president isaac ziv declined last week to disclose any sales figures he said camcorders account for about onequarter of the stores business which also includes televisions vcrs boom boxes telephone answering machines and stereos before a person is going to spend $ 1000 on a camcorder he will go and shop around and when you shop around in other stores and see such a letter would you go to buy at star club we have no idea how many people saw that letter hundreds maybe thousands ziv said aviv mizrahi said well never never be able to know how bad it sales was affected canon attorney shapiro responded they havent come forward with any evidence of any injury to their business such as sales figures ziv who manages the stores daytoday operations said that even now nearly a year after canon retracted the letter under court order if we get a call from a potential customer about a camcorder the second question is if that merchandise is new the star club sting here are some excerpts from the sting videotape recorded by star club owner aviv mizrahi and his brother alon alon mizrahi what do you mean when you say that if you find a better price within a month you can come back russ avisson canon sales representative yeah they guarantee their prices alon mizrahi but we found in star club avisson but thats not an authorized dealer and hes selling open refurbished goods they authorized dealers are not going to match prices with that thats like buying a brand new cadillac and then coming back and saying i found a cadillac for half the price but its four years old and its got 100000 miles aviv mizrahi the guy tells me he has an american warranty avisson he can tell you whatever he wants to tell you i dont know what hes telling you all it is i know is that we have traced back serial numbers and we found out that hes selling goods that do not have a united states warranty and they are refurbished goods so its your choice but thats what the factory found out aviv mizrahi give us your best price avisson well its marked here $ 1299 thats the suggested price what have you found so far alon mizrahi star club was much cheaper avisson yeah but star club is not even selling you new goods so im not even going to consider those guys he does no warranty if its a warranty its his own because canon does not even honor his warranty aviv mizrahi youre sure avisson you just read the letter
