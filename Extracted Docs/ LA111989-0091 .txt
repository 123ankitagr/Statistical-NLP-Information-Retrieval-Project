i read with great interest the article urban river seeks to find its way nov 12 considering that the san diego river once flowed unimpeded from the mountains to the sea it's quite distressing to accept a river that has since been bombarded by civilization fortunately we are witnessing a renewed interest in the san diego river what is desperately needed however is a comprehensive restoration plan which addresses land use wildlife management recreational opportunities flood control and protection of water quality restoration of this once beautiful river will require two basic commitments first and foremost is the dedication of open space along the banks of the river for preservation of wildlife habitat and public access second a river management entity must be established to carefully balance wildlife management recreational interests and water quality anyone who has traveled to san antonio or austin tex realizes that a properly managed urban river can represent an aesthetically pleasing environment with numerous recreational opportunities imagine a linear park with bike paths extending along the banks of the san diego river from mission bay to the cleveland national forest carrying that thought one step further imagine if the water quality could be improved to the point where it was suitable for fishing boating and irrigation a comprehensive river management approach is far preferable to piecemeal mitigation of individual development projects in the flood plain peter maclaggan san diego
