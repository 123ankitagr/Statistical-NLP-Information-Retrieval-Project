we live in a society that is dictated by rules there are rules for marriage rules for raising children and even rules for war so why shouldnt there be rules for dieting for years i have contended that food eaten over the sink doesnt count its not like youre sitting down enjoying something the guilt alone burns off any caloric damage before it ever reaches wherever it is food goes thats why i was delighted finally to see a breakthrough in dieting a list of rules found by a reader in new jersey for example if you drink a diet soda with a candy bar the calories in the candy bar are canceled out by the diet soda foods that have the same color have the same number of calories spinach and pistachio ice cream mushrooms and white chocolate chocolate incidentally is a universal color and may be substituted for any other food choice and heres one ill bet you didnt know food used for medicinal purposes never counts thats right if you have a piece of dry toast with your hot chocolate or a cup of bouillon before your sara lee cheesecake dont even think about the consequences nutritionists probably already know this but cookie pieces contain no calories the process of crumbling causes caloric leakage tasting while you are cooking is considered a public service project and public service is caloriedeductible movierelated foods such as milk duds buttered popcorn and vatsized soft drinks contain no calories whatsoever they are part of an entertainment package and not part of ones personal fuel anything offered by people demonstrating foods in a supermarket and samples set out in candy stores or bakeries dont count in your daily intake of calories dieters are never penalized for good manners i have been on this diet for three weeks now and love it however there is a side effect that is worth mentioning the more i diet the more rules i discover and the more my consciousness is broadened among other things
