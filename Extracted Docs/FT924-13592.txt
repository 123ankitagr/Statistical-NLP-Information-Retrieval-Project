CHRISTIE 'S in Glasgow yesterday sold a run of rare Chelsea Football Club programmes for Pounds 22,000 , double the estimate . The programmes were sold by Mr David Mears , a descendant of the club's founder . Such a complete run of programmes , gathered into 69 bound volumes , is unprecedented . Programmes dating from before 1914 are very rare and the collection included more than 400 of them , plus more than 1,000 pre-1939 programmes . The successful telephone bidder intends to keep the collection intact . The auction did very well , topping Pounds 167,000 .
