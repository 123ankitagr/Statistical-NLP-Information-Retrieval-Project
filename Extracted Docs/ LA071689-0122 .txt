Peary fails to identify the special qualities that earn a film a cult following -- as opposed to critical or box-office success . The 150 movies he discusses in these two volumes include some of the best Hollywood films ( `` Citizen Kane , '' `` The Wizard of Oz , '' `` Singin ' in the Rain '' ) , foreign classics ( `` Children of Paradise , '' `` Beauty and the Beast , '' `` The Seventh Seal '' ) and an assortment of camp curiosities , some of which enjoy genuine cult status ( `` The Rocky Horror Picture Show , '' `` Pink Flamingos , '' `` Mommy Dearest '' ) . Viewers looking for a more interesting video than `` Working Girl '' might want to browse through a copy of `` Cult Movies '' for suggestions , but they 'll probably leave it in the bookstore . It 's hard to imagine anyone sitting down and reading these pedestrian commentaries . To a field already overloaded with fluff , Peary brings precious little .
