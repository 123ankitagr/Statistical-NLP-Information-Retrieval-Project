Texas law protects prosecutors , and there is little chance Randall Dale Adams would be compensated through a lawsuit for his 12 1/2-year imprisonment and near-execution before being freed as the result of a movie about his ordeal . Adams was released from prison last week after new evidence brought out in the film `` The Thin Blue Line '' had strongly suggested that another man killed a Texas policeman . Adams ' attorney , Randy Schaffer , said he intends to ask the Texas Legislature to authorize good-will compensation for Adams , who has since moved home to Columbus , Ohio . `` Even if there 's out-and-out misconduct ... you ca n't sue the prosecutor , '' Dallas civil rights attorney Doug Larson said .
