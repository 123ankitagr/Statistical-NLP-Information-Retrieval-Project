DIGITAL Equipment is leaving its historic headquarters at The Mill , in Maynard , Massachusetts . Built in 1847 as a woollen mill , the building dominates the small New England town . It is a warren of stairs and wooden-floored offices , full of character and tradition , but lacking the efficiency of a modern office block . Digital will continue to keep its headquarters in Maynard .
