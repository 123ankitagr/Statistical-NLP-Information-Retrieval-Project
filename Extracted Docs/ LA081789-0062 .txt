Reviewing the thorny issue of pay raises for the city 's top officials , a Long Beach City Council committee has recommended salary increases ranging from 10 % to 17 % for the city manager , city attorney , city prosecutor , city auditor and city clerk . The proposed salary increases , which must be voted on by the full council , are smaller than those suggested by a private consultant hired to review the officials ' salaries . But committee members argued that the Hay Group 's recommendations were too heavily influenced by comparisons with private corporate salaries . Under the proposal , all but the city manager 's salary would jump between 10 % and 17 % both this year and next . The city manager , who has the highest salary , would get 11 % more this year and an undecided raise next year . Currently , the city manager earns $ 118,200 , the city attorney $ 99,800 , the city prosecutor $ 92,000 , the city auditor $ 84,400 , and the city clerk $ 52,700 .
