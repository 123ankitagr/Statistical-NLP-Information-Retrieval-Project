magnets have come a long way from the school physics laboratory thorn automation of rugeley staffordshire has developed a portable traffic analyser which uses magnets to detect the type of vehicle travelling along the road the edgehog incorporates a magnet in a box secured to a post up to 1.5 metres from the road edge as vehicles pass the magnetic field they produce is measured by the edgehog enabling it to determine the difference between cars van and lorries the main aim of many traffic censuses by placing two edgehogs two metres apart the speed of the vehicles can also be measured thorn automation uk 0889 585151 magnets are also coming to the aid of companies with drinks vending machines the machines often get clogged up with deposits of scale particularly in hard water areas water technics of woking surrey has adapted magnetic technology already used in the processing industry to help keep vending machines in operation to prevent the scaling the water passes through the magnetic field created by strategically-placed magnets the magnetic forces prevent the calcium and magnesium crystals sticking to each other and so being deposited water technics uk 0483 488963
