There appears to be little basis for the theory that smoking by teen-age girls reduces the risk of breast cancer later in life , scientists said last week . A Harvard University study of women ages 30 to 55 found no statistical link between smoking and the risk of breast cancer . The study was published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute . Some researchers have suggested that heavy smoking by young women might lower the risk of breast cancer by reducing the body 's production of estrogen while the breasts are developing . Estrogen controls female sexual development , but some studies have suggested that it also may promote the development of cancer . The study looked at female nurses who were cancer-free in 1976 . The nurses ' smoking habits were closely tracked for 10 years . By 1986 , many cases of breast cancer had been documented in the group but there was no association between current smoking and risk of cancer .
