we may be going back to the age of the pristine whiteenamel era or what was described as the sanitary white kitchen of yesteryear but accessorizing in color is still the fashion word in housewares today it was in the late 20s when a rainbow of color began to radiate in home kitchens according to the housewares story book by earl lifshey published by the national housewares assn in chicago macys was credited with originating the scheme the new york stores campaign ad illustrating kitchen tools and accessories in delft blue apple green and mandarin red ran a headline color comes into your kitchen although there were stages of avocado coppertone and harvest gold between then and now around the early 70s the first group of standard colors adopted for kitchen accessories by the first color committee of the national retail dry goods assn were white kitchen green ivory delphinium blue royal blue and red they were actually a shade closer to the dominant colors we have now in some kitchen appliances and cookware colors on the cabinets in cabinetwork light is the word john pace technical director in kitchen design at california kitchens in burbank stated that the trend in kitchen cabinet finish is still in white or the pale natural tones woodmode a cabinet manufacturer for instance now makes alpine white as well as delicate pastel tones such as peach blush champagne and teal breeze millbrook makes beautifully crafted curved cabinets in exciting highgloss colors of hunter green pink blue and red however pace said the white definitely has greater appeal people are in the kitchen for many hours a day so a shocking cabinet color might get on their nerves when you go to white you can accessorize according to how bold you want to get say a black fruit bowl or orange canister to give a room a different character to be on the safe side work with the spectrum chart otherwise go with a pleasing contrast countertops can fill in for the one color needed in the kitchen colorful choices ran the gamut from pastel to bold in laminated marblelike or plain formica countertops and nonporous synthetic marbles such as nevamars fountainhead corian and avonite to real granite when using granite avoid getting too heavy black and the darker shades can be overbearing the light tans and light reds are easier to live with pace advised smooth countertops may be running in favor with many homemakers but tiles are again getting renewed attention according to pace what has helped the industry is improvement in grouting with new colors and the introduction of a plasticizer to aid in cleaning as well as new sealers to maintain the neat look of tiles theres no end to what you can do with tiles and they certainly provide color in the kitchen in her new book
