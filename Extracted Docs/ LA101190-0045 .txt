it's clear now that two formidable competitors loom for the simpsons on thursday nights one is the cosby show on nbc the other is the simpsons itself fans of the fox series may find it impossible to watch its long-awaited first-run return at 8 tonight channels 11 and 6 without comparing it unfavorably with the weird and brilliant best episodes of last season the simpsons has been such an eclectic inventive and shrewdly written show since its jan 14 premiere as a half-hour animated comedy that even second and third viewings of the same episodes still produce surprises no wonder it was such a smash hit on sunday nights giving fox giddy hope that the simpsons could challenge even that glittering monarch of prime time his royal cosbyship himself thus fox packed off his royal dudeship bart and his family to thursday night what an epic war this would be so complex is the simpsons to produce however that the show's fall debut has come late preceded by its reruns getting destroyed in the ratings opposite first-run episodes of the cosby show but now comes pay-back time right you anticipated america's favorite buck-toothed family delivering so spectacularly tonight that they would light up the sky to say nothing of the nielsens instead you feel a warm glow a half hour that's well very nice it's frequently good but never great a la the simpsons of old a sweet and tender story following the attempts by underachieving but no longer as proud of it bart to avoid failing the fourth grade the episode has its moments horrified by the prospect of repeating a grade bart gets customary fatherly support from homer at least you'll be bigger than the other kids moreover there's some funny business with the nerdy class smarty-pants poindexter and as always the simpsons is an unusual-for-tv kid's-eye view of the world managing to tap genuine emotions and experiences from violent video games to the euphoria of learning that school's been canceled by the season's first heavy snow yes this is that rare series about kids that is written by people you can envision actually having been kids nevertheless tonight's over-sugary episode is not the simpsons in top form coming closer is an episode arriving in two weeks the only other one supplied in advance by fox a much darker stranger meaner and funnier story that finds homer's boss the evil charles montgomery burns running for governor to counteract bad publicity about his pollution-spewing nuclear plant the half hour starts with the discovery of a mutant three-eyed fish in a stream by the plant and then proceeds to lampoon just about everything in sight from political campaigns to the media to criminal polluters like burns he's one of the most despicable men who ever lived marge says obviously why else would homer support him mutant three-eyed fish that's the simpsons
