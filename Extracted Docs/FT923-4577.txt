etched on every ambitious gardeners mind is the image of white flowers set against dark green hedges and shown off in the cool of a summer evening no doubt it has been deeply etched on those of you trapped in a freak european summer where the swimmingpools turned green the children nearly suffocated and the railway lines melted in the extreme italian heat back in england the railway lines have other problems swimmingpools will be swimmingpools but the gales and sudden coldness have not wiped out the image of pale flowers as the garden turns peacefully towards autumn white gardens now stretch far beyond their famous model at sissinghurst castle it takes skill to keep the white flag flying in september and personally i relish the challenge by early autumn white flowers are widely believed to have gone into retreat white corners are a tangle of old campanulas white roses are out of season and the white flowers on the giant crambe have vanished leaving a mass of leaves like yellow cabbage the best white flowers are not a soft colour which needs to be segregated they can easily compete with yellows deep blues and especially strong reds i would rather use them at intervals round a small garden especially in the darker setting of a back garden in the city they are more impressive if they are not isolated this year any expatriate would pine for some of our japanese anemones which are flowering madly after a summer with so much late rain they ought to be a town gardeners first choice for a welcome home after the summer holiday they will put up with dry shade and life in a narrow bed below a london wall they need a few years to give of their best and should never be judged by their first two seasons performance i have compared the varieties carefully and i am convinced that it is worth paying more for the white form with the biggest single flowers geante des blanches is its true name although this lady giant sometimes turns up as white queen i see no particular merit in the double forms the single whites are a godsend and after a few years without disturbance they spread prettily below them at a lower height i recommend the gaura lindheimeri which i have grown to maturity in its second year from a seed packet probably it ought to be tied to a stake but i have let my young plants fall with their white flowers sideways like a graceful form of willow herb anemones hold themselves upright but gauras throw themselves around very prettily one danger is that a hard winter will kill them off at intervals beyond these two fine plants you need spires and spikes of white the spires are best found on the tall veronica virginica which has been hidden from most of us under the new name of veronicastrum the spikes are best on the cimicifugas whose flowers are like white bottlebrushes and whose stems develop best in a semishaded bed which is not too dry these plants have the great advantage of being tall up to five feet in good conditions neither of them is gleaming white but they have a style which is still underexploited beyond these leafy border plants you need white shrubs with density and a higher volume of flower the robust white tree mallow lavatera barnsley is an obvious choice nowadays wherever the garden can run slightly out of control hardy white fuchsias are another possibility often forgotten for their ability to put up with shade white hydrangeas are more obvious and particularly handsome in this wet year the best of the hardy forms is still mme e mouilliere although the more subtle style of the lacecap varieties is superior this year i have a new favourite always listed but seldom seen in thoughtful plantings perhaps because it seems too obvious the whiteflowered obedient plant is five times as good as its purplepink sister its dark green leaves set off obedient stems of white flowers to a height of about two feet its worst enemy is its name pysostegia summer snow but i like to alternate groups of it with the white penstemon snowstorm which took such a beating from its namesake last winter at a greater height behind them you can not beat the best of the phloxes the robust white admiral which flowers from july until late september if you remember to deadhead it there is something special in this varietys pale green leaf and breeding which gives it the vigour lacked by other phloxes in the palecolour range breeders ought to investigate it white flowers without scent would be a poor halfmeasure many people complain that scent is almost unavailable later in the season but they forget their tobacco plants and are among the hundreds of gardeners who overlook the easiest of white lilies lilium formosanum if you sow seed of this variety in january it really will flower in the first year of its life it is extremely easy and is best managed if you pot it on by stages into six or seven inch pots in late june they can be let into gaps left by early varieties next week they will join the last of the white tobacco plants and will spread a strong scent through the chill of early autumn evenings many town gardeners cram the lovely regale lily into pots for july but forget to do anything about this lovely sequel a lily which is happy on any good garden soil lastly i would play around with autumn crocuses the blue varieties are wellknown but i have a weakness for the whiteflowered crocus speciosus albus which soon makes a good clump in any light soil the flowers will be showing in midseptember but the leaves have to wait until next spring like all strong whites they make a big impression in small dense groups the battle for colour is far from over and it merely needs a touch of cunning to keep the flags of white still flying until frost finally forces us all to submit
