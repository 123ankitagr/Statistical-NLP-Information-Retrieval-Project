the new film the nightmare before christmas is a childrens story but you could be forgiven for thinking that it describes the panicstricken weeks of december in the life of a woman juggling job and family work schedules are telescoped by the impending long break and the pressure of shopping escalates if you are in charge you must not forget the details crucial to the smooth running of christmas day all this means that you find yourself firmly at the bottom of the shopping list this is a pity for christmas dressing deserves a little thought it is a day of oddly juxtaposed activities where few rules apply a leisurely glamorous breakfast may be interrupted by hectic presentopening with the children a trip to church may be followed by making the gravy we all imagine that those who live highprofile lives who appear to have made it in life have sorted out such dilemmas to find out we asked a selection of successful career women and some prominent social highflyers to give us their guide to christmas and how to wear and bear it breakfast rosa monckton plans to spend christmas morning at her london flat with her husband journalist dominic lawson and daughter savannah two we will have been to midnight mass but savannah will be up and excited by 7am so well start then and have a long leisurely breakfast later we may go to my parents for a traditional lunch i dont want to plan at home because i organise very publicly at work right up until christmas eve i certainly shant plan what to wear clothes are a low priority comfort is essential i shall assume i have something suitable like a wonderful velvet dressing gown in my wardrobe though i could easily be wrong patricia hodge the actress currently starring in the prime of miss jean brodie at the strand theatre in london will be working until the end of the christmas eve matinee i love doing christmas although the preparation is an enormous headache i take it in turns with my sister this is her year luckily i have only one day off therell be about 20 for lunch and we all help i shopped in the autumn for christmas clothes that would be flexible for other occasions this silk chenille sweater and panne velvet skirt have the right mood together but look different when worn with other things ill put a jokey christmas apron over them for helping in the kitchen sally dalzell runs her wardrobe consultancy change of adress with a partner the christmas runup is their busiest time we lived abroad until quite recently so i am happy to have a traditional english christmas in london after my three children aged nine to 12 come home from boarding school i want to devote myself to them so time for me is bottom of the list we will also have my two grownup stepchildren staying on christmas morning its straight into turkeycooking and presentopening i like to look smart although not hugely dressy relaxation and comfort come above all else i get hot cooking a loose cashmere sweater and leggings would be great i can add a velvet scarf and a coat for church swap the leggings for satin pyjama trousers at home i dont like christmassy colours i would put the outfit together from pieces i already owned anastasia alexander an american started her aroma therapeutics business in britain two years ago it is expanding rapidly in the us and europe this is a very busy time both at work and socially so i have to preplan in america thanksgiving is the family celebration christmas is party time so for breakfast i would probably still be wearing an evening dress here we prefer to be in the country with my three stepchildren our 14monthold daughter alexia and our nanny i am very organised with clothes adding a few pieces each season to update the classics i like wearably avantgarde designers dolce e gabbana romeo gigli dries van noten i have already planned my christmas wardrobe in the morning i will go riding and then have a leisurely breakfast i would choose something countrystyle but festive like a velvet waistcoat and trousers lunch ewa lewis social editor of the tatler is polish by birth she has a family house party for 14 in gloucestershire for which preparations have long been under way and there will be a mix of traditions in poland christmas eve is the big night so we have a formal dinner with caviar borscht and lots of fish christmas day is relaxed presents church champagne then turkey for lunch the staff have a holiday so i give everyone especially my children aged 15 and 13 jobs to do i coordinate it all and cook i dont preplan what to wear at home during christmas but i am very organised i shop early in the season from my favourite designers st laurent tomasz starzewski bruce oldfield laura b with festivities in mind knowing that a country christmas will include sporty and very dressy occasions i take down what i need for any lunch out over the holiday i think a suit in rich velvet is right at home i might wear a soft trouser suit lady charles spencer churchill aka interior decorator jane churchill will go with her three sons aged from 23 to 11 to the family country home blenheim she says christmas lunch is a fairly informal family occasion and i think a suit is right i particularly like armanis they are soft and classic yet smart pastels are very becoming and show off jewellery well im lucky i dont have to stuff the turkey so i can relax and enjoy the whole atmosphere for the evening i would change to something more formal alessandra rossi is a milanesa married to a londonbased italian investment banker she loves entertaining i shop in september with christmas in mind at st laurent and gucci i never leave it till the last minute because nothing will be left in my size i plan what to take but our family lunch is sporty rather than dressy the men wear a tie the women something with red in it i think a printed silk shirt and suede jeans would look relaxed but festive paola tholstrup is a mix of italian polish and german but was brought up in switzerland her husband mogens owns london restaurant daphnes and they have a 20monthold daughter i dont exactly preplan my clothes but i take a selection that ive bought over the years from my favourite shops browns joseph ronit zilhka jil sander i am not interested enough to look for a specific christmas dress for the christmas eve dinner i would take a black cocktail dress for lunch something cosy but smart like a knitted dress spruced up with gilt buttons
