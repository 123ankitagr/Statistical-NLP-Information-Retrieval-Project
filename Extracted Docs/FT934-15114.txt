UNILEVER , the Anglo-Dutch food and consumer products company , has agreed to buy a margarine brand from Ajinomoto , a leading Japanese food manufacturer , for an undisclosed price . The acquisition will lift Nippon Lever , Unilever 's Japanese unit , to Japan's second largest margarine producer , with 25 per cent of the market . The move comes at a time when Japanese food companies are restructuring their operations by cutting down on products and reducing inventories . Ajinomoto , which is also trying to slim its business by cutting unprofitable operations , will leave the margarine market altogether with the sale of its Marina brand . The company entered the market 23 years ago .
