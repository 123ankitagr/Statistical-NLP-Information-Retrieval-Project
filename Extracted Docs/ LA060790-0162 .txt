Texas Air Changing Name : Seven weeks after losing control of Eastern Airlines , Texas Air Corp. Chairman Frank Lorenzo said the company would rename itself Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. after its main subsidiary . `` The name change was made to reflect the fact that the principal business of the company is Continental , '' Lorenzo told shareholders at the company 's annual meeting . He told reporters later that the change does n't mean Texas Air has given up completely on Eastern , but he declined to comment when asked whether he believed he would regain control of the carrier . The name change takes effect Monday .
