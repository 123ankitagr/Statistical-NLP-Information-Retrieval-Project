question we rent a duplex in westchester and los angeles rent control applies our monthtomonth rental agreement says the tenancy may be terminated by either party with 30 days notice no relocation fees are applicable was written in by our landlord nearby duplexes are being rapidly demolished and replaced by new apartments it appears to be only a matter of time before our duplex goes the question is is a clause like this enforceable even though it appears to be contrary to the city rent control law which says my family which includes a minor child is entitled to a $ 5000 relocation fee answer the clause is not enforceable because as you said it conflicts with the citys rent law if your owner decides to demolish and asks you to leave the premises you are entitled to the relocation money similarly any renter in los angeles who is asked to move or evicted through a nofault eviction in which the renter is not at fault does nothing wrong is entitled to relocation fees nofault evictions include the following the owner wants to move in his parents children himself or his spouse to demolish the property or when an owner seeks to permanently remove a rental unit from rental housing use relocation fees are paid at the rate of $ 5000 a unit to the elderly handicapped or families with minor children others get $ 2000 rental owner must provide safe carpet q the carpet in my los angeles apartment is badly worn it was used four years ago when i moved in and the owner wont replace it until i move out or a premium is added to the rent although the unit is rent controlled shouldnt i expect minor maintenance such as this for wear and tear a carpeting like anything in a rental must be maintained in a safe condition while it may be worn it may still be safe if it is the owner is not obligated to replace or repair it if the carpet is unsafe for instance has holes in it which could cause you to trip and fall the owner must do something about it he does not however have to replace the carpet he may repair it and that would be minor maintenance if the owner opts to replace the carpet he is entitled to a rent increase under las rent law for that capital improvement which is what replacement is considered under the law landlord can take action on damages q the renter has moved out of my los angeles apartment it was clean when he moved in but its not clean now the tenant also left holes in the walls of all of the rooms with an extra big one in the living room ceiling i also just recently paid a $ 7998 plumbing bill that the plumber said was caused by a grease stoppage and finally he broke the locks on our gate and broke into our garage the question is what can i do now do i deduct money from the security deposit or sue in small claims court a you may deduct money from the deposit for the actual cost of the cleaning and to repair damages that are over and above normal wear and tear holes in the walls resulting from renters hanging pictures and the like are usually considered normal wear and tear by the courts the big one in the living room you allude to probably is not since you say it was the plumber as an independent expert who ascertained that the drain stoppage resulted from grease you should be safe in deducting the charge to unclog the drain the broken gate lock and the garage breakin and any damages related to it are not obviously considered normal wear and tear however unless the renter admitted breaking the lock or breaking into the garage you would be hardpressed to prove in small claims court that he is culpable you may sue this renter in small claims court for any damages that exceed his security deposit from which you may deduct money for the cleaning damages and unpaid rent if there was any tenant without bank account prefers cash q i live in arroyo grande near san luis obispo and i have a problem my lease says i must pay my rent by check or money order i dont have a bank account and getting money orders is very inconvenient and costly heres my question can i be evicted because i prefer to pay the rent in cash a absent an agreement to the contrary an owner may demand to be paid his rent in cash if he gives a renter some extra time to get it there is no rulelaw that says you can not enter into an agreement as you say you have done to pay the rent in a form other than cash id keep paying the rent by money order landlady wants to rent monthtomonth q my husband and i moved into our onebedroom glendora apartment about a year ago we signed a oneyear lease now our landlady wants to turn our lease into a monthtomonth rental agreement she says that if we dont sign the new agreement she will evict us can she do that if we sign the agreement is there a chance that she could still evict us she just raised the rent by $ 25 a month and were afraid that shell continue to do so with this new monthtomonth arrangement and no rent control in the city a the landlady can require you to move out with a 30day notice at any time now that the lease has expired she doesnt need a reason in glendora such as they didnt sign the new agreement to do so dont be overly concerned with the $ 25 rent increase as annual rent increases are fairly common within the industry if your landlady really wanted you to move out she probably would not have offered you a monthtomonth rental agreement
