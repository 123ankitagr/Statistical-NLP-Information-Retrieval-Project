A fire that forced a Soviet nuclear submarine to limp toward port was caused by a pipe that burst , causing a reactor malfunction but no injuries , Soviet officials said today . The sub billowed smoke today as it steamed under the power of back-up diesel engines . Norwegian officials criticized Soviet officials for not informing them fully of the accident , the second involving a Soviet vessel off Norway in less than a week and the third in three months . 'It Is Unsatisfactory ' '' It is unsatisfactory for us as a neighboring state not to be warned , '' Defense Minister Johan Jorgen Holst told a news conference . No radiation leaks were reported aboard the vessel , which was of a class built in the 1960s to carry nuclear-tipped cruise missiles . In Moscow , Soviet Defense Minister Dmitri T. Yazov said the accident happened on the sub 's energy apparatus while the sub was submerged . A reactor pipeline burst and its seal was broken , the government newspaper Izvestia quoted him as saying . Yazov said the sub switched to backup diesel engines , surfaced and took on water to cool the reactor . He said all crew members were safe and the accident did not damage the environment . Yazov said another Soviet vessel will escort the ship east to Severomorsk . Soviet media did not give the name of the Echo II class submarine or say whether it was carrying nuclear weapons . A Norwegian Northern Defense Command spokesman said the submarine apparently caught fire at about 5 a.m. in the Norwegian Sea off northern Norway . On June 20 , the Soviet cruise ship Maxim Gorky was torn open by ice and nearly sank near Norway 's Spitzbergen Island . No casualties were reported . On April 7 , a Soviet Mike-class submarine caught fire and sank in the Norwegian Sea , killing 42 Soviet sailors .
