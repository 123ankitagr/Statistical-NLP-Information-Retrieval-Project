The winter class of '89 is learning how to write parking citations , get abandoned vehicles off the streets of Los Angeles and direct traffic . Above all , says city parking administrator Robert Yates , traffic officer trainees are being impressed `` with the image they present to the public and the importance of their roles in making sure we have traffic mobility . '' The trainees -- who will work for the city 's Department of Transportation , not as sworn police officers -- spend two weeks studying city parking law , radio communication , driving techniques and how to deal with motorists . They spend another week in the streets learning traffic control . Each new traffic officer is on six months ' probation under the tutelage of a veteran .
