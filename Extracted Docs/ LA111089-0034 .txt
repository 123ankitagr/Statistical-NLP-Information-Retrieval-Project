the current mess in auto insurance in california has taken years to get into and may well take years to get out of if ever i would like to suggest a simple and easy way to clear the decks 1 let the state establish a stateoperated insurance carrier operated solely on insurance premiums with no tax revenue to be used to subsidize it 2 abolish all rate regulations on private insurance carriers they will be constrained by competition with each other and with the state insurance carrier to offer fair and competitive rates 3 abolish the current requirement that all drivers carry auto insurance the history of this law both here and elsewhere is uniformly horrid i dont promise that this will make insurance rates affordable one more reason for no 3 but if it doesnt at least it will then be obvious that the problem is with the court system and excessive awards not the insurance industry michael d grotke lake elsinore
