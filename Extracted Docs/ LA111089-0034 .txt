The current mess in auto insurance in California has taken years to get into and may well take years to get out of -- if ever . I would like to suggest a simple and easy way to clear the decks . 1 . Let the state establish a state-operated insurance carrier , operated solely on insurance premiums with no tax revenue to be used to subsidize it . 2 . Abolish all rate regulations on private insurance carriers . They will be constrained by competition with each other , and with the state insurance carrier to offer fair and competitive rates . 3 . Abolish the current requirement that all drivers carry auto insurance . The history of this law , both here and elsewhere , is uniformly horrid . I do n't promise that this will make insurance rates affordable ( one more reason for No . 3 ) , but if it does n't at least it will then be obvious that the problem is with the court system and excessive awards , not the insurance industry .
