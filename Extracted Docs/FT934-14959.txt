DIRECTORS of all local enterprise companies in southern Scotland are to have their interests in decisions taken by their boards published in the companies ' annual reports . The announcement was made yesterday by Scottish Enterprise , which co-ordinates the local enterprise companies in Scotland outside the Highlands . The companies are the equivalent of England and Wales ' training and enterprise councils . The move follows disclosures by Scottish newspapers that businesses run by enterprise company directors benefited financially from decisions made by the enterprise companies ' boards . Recently it emerged that Forth Valley Enterprise based at Stirling had paid Pounds 825,000 to organisations whose representatives sat on its board . The news came out when the Falkirk Herald consulted a public register of the interests of the enterprise company 's directors . Professor Donald MacKay , chairman of Scottish Enterprise , said that directors of the 13 enterprise compnies declared an interest when the boards were discussing issues in which they were directly affected , such as the placing of contracts and the awarding of financial assistance . The rules require that the directors withdraw when matters in which they may benefit are being discussed . Some enterprise companies already publish their directors ' interests in their annual reports , while others have registers of the interests available on request . Prof MacKay said that Scottish Enterprise had investigated all cases where it was alleged that directors had abused their positions , but had found no evidence to support the claims . He added that enterprise companies would publish declarations of interest in a standard form in their next annual reports and would also use a standard format for the reports .
