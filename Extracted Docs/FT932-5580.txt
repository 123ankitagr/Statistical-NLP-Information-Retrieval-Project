rather than jobs and houses are giving grounds for optimism in the newspaper advertising market which is generally flat in spite of hopes of a consumerled recovery from recession after two disastrous years which saw national press advertising revenue fall by almost a quarter the industry is wary of predicting a false dawn not least because the differing fortunes of britains 11 daily newspapers and the types of advertising they are winning reflect the different impact the recovery is having on advertising sectors although overall advertising revenues remain dramatically down the signs are that some titles and sectors are showing a glimmer of recovery in the past three months advertising revenue at the daily mail which has the largest volume of display advertising has been 12 per cent higher than during the same period last year at the daily telegraph the quality paper with the most display advertising revenue for april and may has been 23 per cent and 11 per cent higher year on year mr len sanderson advertising director of the daily telegraph said i am still cautious but we have had some encouraging months it will take several months of growth before he is confident that these green shoots are genuine the caution seems wise given the erratic nature of the industrys performance in the past year the times said that colour advertising had grown by 30 per cent last month but this had been offset by a fall in black and white advertising advertising revenues at the financial times have swung between months with aprils figures fractionally up on the previous years but mays 9 per cent lower these fluctuations are only natural in an industry which has never been an entirely reliable economic barometer advertising revenues in april last year were particularly low because of the general election mr harold lind a media consultant said advertising is a cyclical business the normal expectation is that television moves first followed by the lower end of display advertising then feeding into the classified advertising and recruitment last of all he believes that the 3 per cent growth in television advertising expenditure last year indicates a trend for the press this year mr sanderson said the telegraph newspapers had taken their main growth from three sectors a 20 per cent growth in travel advertising a spate of car promotions at the start of the year and a steady expansion of financial products advertising classified advertisments which draw heavily on the recruitment and property market had remained weak at the guardian which has 43 per cent of market share for recruitment advertisements volume fell 9 per cent in april few advertising directors are predicting much expansion in the next months or any real end to the heavy discounting that means most newspapers have been receiving revenues 35 per cent lower than their official ratecard figures in the past two years ms caroline midmore media manager at advertising agency young and rubicam said until we get newspaper rates rising again you certainly cant really say were out of the recession
