brand manufacturers intend to launch a series of court cases against supermarkets that sell lookalike products having become convinced that a fullscale war with the big supermarket chains has become unavoidable their fears of sales being damaged by supermarket products packaged to resemble leading brands have been underlined by an nop opinion poll published by the brand manufacturers it shows that more than a fifth of all consumers purchased supermarkets own brands in the mistaken belief that they were purchasing a leading branded product mr john murphy chairman of the brand development company interbrand and spokesman for the british producers and brand owners group said the brand manufacturers felt that they had been exploited by supermarkets for too long there are a series of other supermarket ripoff products in the pipeline he said but brand owners are now going to take on the retailers in a major way he said the brand owners would be launching a series of lawsuits alleging that supermarkets were passing off in the packaging of their products cocacola is widely expected to initiate the legal campaign with a passingoff case against sainsbury for allegedly infringing cocacolas intellectual property rights with its classic cola range of soft drinks we have made our views known to sainsbury said mr peter stokes of cocacola however i can not comment on what further action we will take until our talks with the company are completed mr murphy said sainsbury was likely to be the target of several cases manufacturers might launch a case against the group in france where the supermarket chain has recently opened a shop in calais and where the legal restrictions on lookalikes are much tighter than in the uk the nop poll was conducted three weeks ago and involved interviews with 1008 shoppers of these 42 per cent said they had picked a supermarkets product off the shelf thinking it was a manufacturers brand and 21 per cent said they had mistakenly bought a lookalike product equally worrying for the brand manufacturers is that 41 per cent believed mistakenly that supermarkets products were made by the manufacturers of the marketleading equivalents the results seem to contradict an earlier mori poll for the british retail consortium of 514 shoppers which found that 78 per cent said they never confused branded goods and the lookalike version the brand owners group which includes procter gamble unilever nestle and mars has so far failed to persuade the government to amend the trade mark bill before parliament to introduce curbs on lookalike products
