Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : 'The Mother of Kings ' Poland , 1982 , 126 minutes 8:45 The title is ironic ; the three sons of this working-class Warsaw family are pulled into Communism or petty crime , while their widowed mother continues to have faith in ideals and/or men who unfailingly let her down during the 30-year span of the story , from 1930 to 1956 . Begun in 1982 , then stopped when martial law was imposed , Janusz Zsorki 's tribute to naive tenacity won a prize for its central actress , Magda Theresa Wojcikz ; its brooding black-and-white camera work is splendid , but it is a long sit and a far too predictable story . -- SHEILA BENSON
