For Alexander Oseichuk , who remembers when Josef Stalin banned saxophones in the 1950s , it was a dream come true to be trading riffs with American sax legend Joe Henderson . Oseichuk and three other Soviet jazzmen , who learned most of what they know of American jazz by listening to records , found themselves recently jamming with the real thing . The Igor Bril Quartet , an all-star collection of musicians from the Soviet Union , played in three concerts with American jazz greats Bobbie Hutcherson and Joe Henderson , and there was amazement on both sides over the way they jelled . `` You 'd never know these guys had n't been together for a long time , '' said Gerry Pearlman , the American promoter of the concerts in San Francisco , Stanford University and Mill Valley . `` They were trading off wonderfully . '' Vibes virtuoso Hutcherson said he was impressed with the musicianship of the Soviet players , who included pianist Bril , Oseichuk on the saxophone , Victor Dvoskin on bass and Eugene Ryaboy on drums .
