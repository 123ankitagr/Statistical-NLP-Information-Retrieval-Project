Regarding former President Carter 's column ( `` A Tundra Industrial Complex ? No ! '' Commentary , Dec. 1 ) about the possibility of drilling/developing oil in more wilderness in northern Alaska , this column could not have been more timely , with the prospect of war with Iraq . If we were to develop this pristine wilderness , only approximately .2 % of U.S. demand could come from this field during its 30-year estimated life . Developing oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is strictly short-term greed that will do very little to relieve our dependence on imported oil , but will do long-term damage to a spectacular wilderness . Having been fortunate to visit the refuge , I am one of the few who knows firsthand the incredible beauty and abundance of wildlife there . How dare the Reagan Administration , and now the Bush Administration , attempt to undo the greatest environmental legislation in this century , the 1980 Alaska Lands Act , which gave protection to wilderness areas in Alaska . The fact is the U.S. is going to be dependent on foreign oil for a long time unless we develop more efficient mileage automobiles , and are more aggressive in developing alternative energy sources . Then we will be less reliant on foreign oil and would not have to face the possibility of war over oil ! JOE FUHRMAN , Mar Vista
