United Airlines has asked the federal government for approval to serve Madrid and Manchester , England , from its hub at Washington Dulles International Airport . United said it would provide daily service on each route , using Boeing 767-200ER aircraft . Chairman Stephen M. Wolf said the applications were part of a United strategy to become `` a truly global airline in the 1990s . '' He said United 's hub at Dulles , in the Virginia suburbs of Washington , would permit Madrid and Manchester passengers to connect with United flights to 55 other cities in the United States . In Europe , he said , United 's strategy is to concentrate service on primary transportation centers in France , Germany , Italy and the United Kingdom and to expand to other European cities as opportunities arise and new aircraft become available . Berlin , Warsaw , Moscow and Milan/Rome also are on United 's list of cities to be served , Wolf said . United also has been expanding aggressively in the Pacific .
