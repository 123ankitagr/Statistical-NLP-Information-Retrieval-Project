in this country the craze for manchester's current summer of love is still kind of theoretical you're more likely to read an article about a manchester band than hear one on the radio more likely to know about the fashion bell-bottoms than about the sound still manchester house-music extravaganzas have been popping up in los angeles with some regularity in the last few weeks both home-grown and imported and with the packed happy mondays show at the hollywood palladium friday the phenomenon may have achieved critical mass you entered through a lobby rigged with elaborate strobes a bubble machine and a banner reading the united states of manchester you fought your way through a crowd of kids wearing souvenir t-shirts from last month's manchester shows here on stage around midnight these bands follow club hours not concert hours the manchester house sensation called a guy called gerald one of the two opening acts stood behind a bank of electronic equipment bobbing his shoulders occasionally tweaking a knob pushing buttons or was that a guy named gerald standing next to him bending back and forth playing glockenspiel-like keyboard lines primarily a studio kind of guy gerald likes to cultivate anonymity a busty woman in the tightest possible mini-dress wailed counterpoint in the genre-approved third-world-ecstatic style and the result was bloodless standard-issue house music raw on a screen behind the dance floor op-art patterns shimmered stick figures danced and a happy face the symbol of druggy british house music appeared surrounded by pulsing concentric circles love love love and acid acid acid flashed onto the screen if you'd looked away from the stage at one point you might have noticed the beat getting a little stronger the musical samples more interesting the people on the crowded dance floor actually dancing this of course meant that gerald and friends had finished their set and one of the deejays imported from manchester's hacienda club had slipped on a record without missing a beat happy mondays is possibly the band most associated with the manchester scene stone roses is more a band than a manchester band at this point as proud of its members drug-dealer pasts as it is of its no 1 singles singer shaun ryder stands stock-still as a talking head he croons in a flat jim morrison baritone and hides behind a light-filled smoke screen like that other enigmatic manchester front man the fall's mark e smith bez who doesn't actually sing or play an instrument lopes in place like a man trying to run underwater commanding the stage acting sort of as the flavor flav of public enemy to ryder's chuck d happy mondays manages to be one of the few bands anywhere that manages to sound simultaneously powerful and cheesy its big builds and edgy sonorities friday were sometimes more than a little reminiscent of primo doors and nearly as hypnotic as shrieking and as self-consciously dull they're the first of the recent live manchester arrivals worth listening to bring on the stone roses and their aggressive danceable psychedelia may have what it takes to evolve into a solid second-tier rock presence additional reviews on page 7 and 11 jonathan gold
