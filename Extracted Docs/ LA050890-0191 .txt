West Virginia has talked with Big Ten officials about joining the conference should it decide to expand its membership , Mountaineer Athletic Director Ed Pastilong said . `` We have had informal talks with the Big Ten . We have talked with ( Big Ten Commissioner ) Jim Delany and with some of the other member schools , '' Pastilong said . `` I think if the Big Ten does consider adding a 12th team that we would be given serious consideration , '' he told the Charleston Daily Mail . The Big Ten presidents have invited Penn State to join the conference , but that situation reportedly has grown shaky because of opposition from some members . There also has been speculation , including a story in last week 's Sports Illustrated , that if Penn State gets in , the conference might add a 12th member and go to divisional play .
