Australian boxer Patrick Stone was hospitalized with a blood clot on his brain today after winning a 10-round light-heavyweight bout . Stone collapsed in his corner seconds after scoring a unanimous decision over fellow Australian Garry Wills to win the vacant Queensland state title . Official ring physician Jim Yates treated Stone in the ring for apparent heat exhaustion . Ten minutes later , his head rolling from side to side and blood dripping from his mouth , the boxer was carried into the dressing room and later taken by ambulance to the nearby Princess Alexandra Hospital . `` Stone has a blood clot on the right side of his brain and is paralyzed down his left side , '' Yates said . `` He is responding to some commands , but is not fully conscious .
