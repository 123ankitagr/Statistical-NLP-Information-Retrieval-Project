the label mahlerian is often used too loosely yet it seems appropriate for tuesday's prom conducted by simon rattle besides the adagio from mahler's tenth symphony the programme included berg's early altenberg lieder and shostakovich's fourth symphony a work over which the austrian symphonist's spectre looms large rattle and his city of birmingham symphony orchestra have a reputation in mahler's last work here rattle conducted from memory the opening movement with a liquid flowing baton shaping the cbso's smooth strings in passionate arches of melody he built up the sonorous organ-like climax massively and maintained the intensity in the music's dying phrases much in the five altenberg lieder reveals berg's musical roots in mahler but not the startling orchestral opening in which complex ostinatos conjure up the snowstorm of the first poem rattle conducted with incisive clarity revelling in the colourful sonorities but occasionally smothering the soprano soloist heather harper miss harper who has come out of retirement to sing in two proms this year showed her affinity with the music she made each of berg's concentrated phrases the score is a model of economy tell and found lyricism in the searching lines shostakovich's baffling fourth symphony is seldom played in an act of self-censorship the composer suppressed it for 25 years had it been premiered in 1936 as scheduled its revisiting of mahler's emotional world would almost certainly have brought down stalin's wrath on shostakovich significantly one of the composers approached to complete mahler's tenth though he declined another suggestion of mahler was in the sheer size of shostakovich's orchestra and here the cbso flexed its collective muscle with shattering results from the thrusting opening chords this was high-voltage rattle but he rather overplayed the work's quirkiness that can obscure the anguish bottled up inside above all this was a performance that brought home the horror that the still-idealistic shostakovich was glimpsing
