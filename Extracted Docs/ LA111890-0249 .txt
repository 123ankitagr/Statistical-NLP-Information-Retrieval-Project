hapless bowl 90 is over and we have a loser it wasnt even close cal state fullerton under new mexico state 943 snapping the aggies amazing streak of consecutive losses at 27 and leaving the titans all alone atop the division ia football rankings assuming youre looking at them standing on your head theyre no 106 out of deference to gene murphy well cut the oneliners there murphy is a good coach who deserves much much better but a crossroads was reached saturday in las cruces and it raises a question that deserves immediate attention along with an answer were not talking about fullerton dropping football were talking about the big west conference dropping its football fixation the big west has been flogging a dead horse for years pretending to play grownup football without the money the resources the players and the facilities necessary just to scrape together the dream when big west football is bad it is as bad as it gets no one in the big west can be proud of saturdays fullertonnew mexico state fiasco but even when big west football is good no one takes it seriously saturday the big west also staged its championship game fresno state vs san jose state for a trip to the california raisin bowl for the thrill and prestige of getting to face central michigan hurry get those tickets today youd accuse the big west of fooling itself except it consigned itself to national obscurity by agreeing to the bowl tiein with the midamerican conference in the first place today thats how the rest of the country views big west football the toledos and the ball states of the pacific and now with the sport braced for the dawning of the age of the super conference big west football has hit a wall it is never going to ascend or obliterate it is time the big west faced facts called off the sham cut its losses and let san jose state and fresno state go free it is time the big west went the way of the big east basketball first second and third and let the football programs fall where they may right now the big west has a firstinalifetime opportunity to capitalize on an ncaa basketball championship even if nevada las vegas cant last april after unlv nuked duke in denver the big west grabbed the nations attention at last if it wants to keep it and the big west has two more top 25type programs at new mexico state and cal state long beach it had better do something about its footballandchain in san jose and fresno the big west has two viable thriving yearin and yearout legitimate division ia football programs it used to have three but san diego state got smart and jumped to the wac in 1978 san jose and fresno are making noises about testing the same waters and the big west would do best to step aside of course without san jose and fresno big west football would have to be reclassified division iaa so let it theres nothing wrong with playing division iaa football some of gene murphys best friends play division iaa football playing division iaa football doesnt make you a bad person fullerton would have room to breathe and grow in division iaa so would new mexico state and long beach which needed a pr gimmick as outlandish as george allen to resuscitate its program how could that be any less desirable than the current state of affairs with five of the big wests eight footballplaying schools unable to crack the top 90 before saturday one national poll had the university of the pacific at no 91 followed by long beach at 93 unlv at 98 and the fullertonnew mexico anchor at 105 and 106 the conference clearly sought to emulate the big east in 1988 when it changed its name from the pacific coast athletic assn the name has caught on helping the big west garner equal billing with the big east and the big 10 on espns periodic big monday basketball tripleheaders now it should take the next step the big east is a conference with its priorities in order it exists for basketball first and foremost and is regarded as the heaviest of all college basketball heavyweights depending on how one feels about the acc at a given moment big east schools also play football on three levels boston college pittsburgh and syracuse are division ia independents connecticut and villanova are members of the division iaa yankee conference georgetown and st johns play division iii football break up the big west the same way let san jose and fresno joust their bigtime windmills as either football independents or parttime wac tackons if unlv wants to follow fine group the others under a division iaa heading with maybe cal state northridge thrown in so that the pigskin heads can keep their football while the conference can be called something other than the big drain hundreds of thousands of dollars will be saved imagine what that could mean to big west basketball better recruiting better arenas better names on the home schedule how about ucla at fullerton instead of as always the other way around imagine someday a big eastbig west challenge with georgetownuc irvine at the bren center ok ok bad example imagine someday a big eastbig west challenge with syracuselong beach at the long beach arena there it could happen here big west basketball is closer to prime time than it has ever been before the final leap isnt unfathomable unlike football basketball programs can make major strides in a hurry and with the exception of irvine every big west school has been to the ncaa tournament at least once since 1977 the only thing standing in the way of big west basketball is big west football sacrifice the hapless bowl for more trips to the final four
