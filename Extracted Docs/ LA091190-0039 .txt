Software Toolworks Inc. , a rapidly growing maker of video games and personal-computer software , moved its headquarters from Chatsworth to Novato . Besides its corporate staff , the company also moved its research-and-development operations , and overall about 75 employees were transferred , Chairman Les Crane said . But the company left its duplicating , printing and packaging operations in Chatsworth , he said . Software Toolworks chose Novato , situated north of San Francisco in Marin County , because `` the pool of available manpower is rich and deep and we felt the environment was perhaps more conducive to creative programming , '' Crane said .
