armed with a personal computer and a modem the world of online information is just a telephone line and a mouse click away once on the information superhighway the possibilities are almost limitless from weather forecasts to astro physics there are few subjects not covered on the internet or in what has become known as cyberspace the internet itself is an informal system linking more than 7500 individual computer networks and more than 2m computers in academic institutions companies and other organisations it is used mostly for electronic mail email and information exchange by an estimated 25m to 30m people a figure rising by between 5 and 10 per cent a month but the internet is not the only source of online information there are thousands of bulletin board systems bbs mostly run by computer enthusiasts and a wide range of commercial online information services so how does the novice begin to explore this world the traditional route has been the local bbs an electronic notice board on which messages can be left most bbss also enable users to send upload or receive download software and other data a bbs is run by sysops systems operators who are usually computer enthusiasts to help newbies newcomers to the world of pc communications bbs telephone access numbers the numbers used by communications software to connect a home pc modem to the bbs modem are often listed in computer magazines most online systems although not compuserve expect your communications software to be set to the following parameters eight bits no parity one stop or 8n1 and support a number of different protocols or modem communications languages for downloading computer files among the most common protocols are xmodem zmodem ymodem and kermit usually there is no charge other than ordinary telephone charges for logging on to an amateur bbs there are however also a growing number of commercial bbs most of which advertise in magazines which charge for downloading programs and sometimes pornographic pictures or can only be reached via premiumpriced telephone numbers although it is reasonably easy to set up communications software and a modem to dial into a bbs many new users may find it easier to start with one of the commercial information services such as compuserve information service cis or delphi or a commercial conferencing system such as the computer information exchange cix although most of these services started in the us they are now available via a local call in the uk their big advantage over the neighbourhood bbs is that they have helpful telephone hotlines ready to talk new users through their first tentative steps along the information superhighway these services generally charge a joinup fee and then a flat monthly membership fee of between pounds 6 and pounds 10 however in an effort to sign up new customers they often waive the signup fee and offer potential users free trials to sign up with compuserve call 0800289378 or log on to 0171490 8881 by modem with the parameters set to 71e for cix call 0181390 8446 or log on to 0181390 1255 with the parameters set to 8n1 for delphi call 0171757 7080 new customers usually receive membership kits which in addition to a local access telephone number and a password needed to log on to their master computer usually include a manual and in the case of compuserve a dedicated software package called cim compuserve information manager which is available in dos windows and macintosh versions although initial charges are low it is easy to build up a sizeable bill quite quickly commercial online services generally charge a flat monthly fee and an additional fee for information outside their basic services plus in the uk at least the pc user will have to pay telephone call charges to reduce costs most commercial online services give customers local numbers which can be used to access their services there are also special software packages called offline readers or olrs that enable you to prepare before the communications software connects to the service and the meter starts ticking using an olr such as navcis for compuserve or ameol and wigwam for cix a onehour session can be reduced to a few minutes online commercial online services also provide one of the simplest methods of connecting to and sampling the internet for example cix compuserve and delphi allow their subscribers to send and receive email to and from other internet addresses they also provide access to usenet newsgroups there are around 10000 usenet discussion groups on the internet and cix and delphi provide access to a special ip internet protocol prompt this means users can search for files on remote computers and upload or download files from other computers connected to the internet using file transfer protocol ftp via the online service at present however the commercial online services in britain stop short of providing full internet access in particular they do not provide access to one of the most exciting areas of the internet the worldwide web since its creation in 1992 the worldwide web has become the fastestgrowing internet service with more than 3000 web sites and tens of thousands of documents published by academic institutions companies and governments but to access the web the fledgling cybernaut needs a direct internet connection available from a specialised telecommunications company called an internet service provider direct internet access also involves running a communications program called a tcpip stack the internets networking protocol and setting up for full direct access to the internet can be tricky fortunately however internet service providers have begun to provide software or make it available for downloading for many new users this may be a key factor in choosing a service provider part 3 on january 7 choosing an internet service supplier and internet software
