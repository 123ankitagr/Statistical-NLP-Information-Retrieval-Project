Reversing an earlier decision , a Pomona Superior Court judge ruled that a countersuit filed against the city by a former redevelopment consultant will be heard in court . Monday 's decision by Superior Court Judge Thomas Nuss will allow Fred Lyte , who was fired by the City Council in December , 1988 , to countersue the city for $ 1.38 million that Lyte says he is owed . Early last year , the city sued Lyte , charging he recommended projects from which he stood to benefit financially . The city 's suit claims Lyte owes Irwindale more than $ 1 million in commissions he received on redevelopment projects .
