the us electronics company hewlettpackard has developed what it claims is the worlds brightest lightemitting diode clusters of the chips which are up to four times brighter than existing devices could replace ordinary incandescent light bulbs where long life and reliability are required such as in traffic lights the breakthrough has been achieved through the development of a transparent gallium phosphide substrate which enables significantly more light to emit from the diode than did the traditional substrate lightabsorbing gallium arsenide the new leds should be available within the next six months hewlettpackard us 415 857 1501
