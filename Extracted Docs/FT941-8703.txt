the us electronics company hewlett-packard has developed what it claims is the world's brightest light-emitting diode clusters of the chips which are up to four times brighter than existing devices could replace ordinary incandescent light bulbs where long life and reliability are required such as in traffic lights the breakthrough has been achieved through the development of a transparent gallium phosphide substrate which enables significantly more light to emit from the diode than did the traditional substrate light-absorbing gallium arsenide the new leds should be available within the next six months hewlett-packard us 415 857 1501
