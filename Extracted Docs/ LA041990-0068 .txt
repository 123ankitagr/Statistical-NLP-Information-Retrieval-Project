when dr c wayne callaway an endocrinologist speaking on behalf of the american board of nutrition testified at a congressional hearing on the weightloss industry he told the committee that the weightloss business in the united states has gotten out of hand callaway was not alone nancy s wellman phd a registered dietitian and president of the american dietetic assn whose 59000 members comprise the nations largest group of food and nutrition professionals also testified at the hearing too often the emphasis is on the pocketbook not the paunch she told a subcommittee of the house committee on small business because the $ 33 billionayear weightloss industry is largely unregulated it has operated like an untamed runaway horse for decades and accountability the critics believe is long overdue the issue with quick weightloss diet programs is that they are acting on response to market demand said marsha hudnall a registered dietitian interviewed at an american dietetic assn conference in los angeles recently there is a professional responsibility to design diet strategies based on scientific evidence according to the guidelines of the american dietetic assn ideal weight is based on 10 calories per pound of current weight which means that a person weighing 150 pounds should consume a total of 1500 calories a day many of these programs are much lower than that with calorie levels anywhere from 1000 to 1500 calories and some popular liquid diets are even lower with 400 to 800 calories a day hudnall said wellman thinks that very low calorie diets are not for people with medical conditions such as active cancer insulindependent diabetes renal failure cardiac dysfunction or severe psychological disturbances these diets should not be used by infants teenagers pregnant and breastfeeding women or older americans she added nutrisystems a portioned meal plan optifast a liquid formula diet program and slim fast a partial liquid diet program the program involves two glasses of liquid formula and one meal a day are among those being criticized for making use of low calorie intakes during weight loss dr stuart shapiro former philadelphia commissioner of health and current national director of nutrisystems insists that the program is medically safe we dont consider ourselves a fast weight loss program shapiro said we provide a nutritionally balanced meal plan that meets safe calorie levels recommended by major health organizations medical literature is clear that weight loss programs should be tailored to individuals and for many individuals 1000 calories a day may be appropriate while for others 1500 may be nutrisystems is a comprehensive weight loss and management program tailored to individual needs weight loss of 1 12 to 2 pounds per week about 1 of body weight per week until ideal weight is achieved is followed by a maintenance program using portioned meals twice a week and continual access to nutrition classes shapiro said william bush senior vice president of sandoz nutritionoptifast pointed out that optifast is a 15yearold program originally developed for hospital treatment of the grossly obese the program is now available primarily through hospital outpatient clinics and is intended for patients who are 30 overweight obesity is categorized as being 20 above ideal weight bush contends that optifast has been unfairly lumped in with storefront operations that do not offer the medical supervision or the comprehensive program to teach people how to keep weight off our average patient loses 45 pounds in 26 weeks and at the end of 18 months they have maintained loss of twothirds of that weight the data bush said comes from large multicenter trials one involving 1500 patients and the other 500 the optifast program can cost a patient from $ 2500 to $ 3000 the first 12week phase of the threephase program begins with a 420 to 800 calorie formula diet followed by gradual introduction of normal foods behavior modification exercise lab tests and supervision by credentialed professionals and physicians also are provided some lowcalorie diets have been useful as shortterm methods for reducing weight in the dangerously obese and in persons with hypertension diabetes or high blood levels callaway pointed out the congressional hearing in late march was just the beginning according to callaway the warning has been sounded and there are stirrings within the federal trade commission and the food and drug administration for further investigations we must better define roles of the ftc and fda in regulatory aspects of such diets said callaway the hullabaloo started three months ago when 18 florida women filed suits against nutrisystems claiming that rapid weight loss affects bile in the gallbladder and contributes to the formation of gallstones according to callaway gallbladder problems occur with extremely high frequency when people go on low calorie diets a study published in the archives of internal medicine showed that in eight weeks of dieting on a 500 calorie diet 25 of dieters developed gallstones in contrast equally overweight individuals who did not diet showed no development of gallstones callaway also pointed out that many diet program promoters blame obesity and not the diet for obese persons gallbladder problems according to shapiro of nutrisystems there is no evidence linking gallbladder disease to weightloss programs like nutrisystems we will defend against the suit and we will prevail said tim hermeling public affairs director for nutrisystems the comprehensive weightloss program provides a $ 49 to $ 64 weekly food and beverage package for an initial 1000 to 1500 calorie intake per day followed by a yearlong maintenance diet adding behavior modification and education to the program a nutrisystems nutrition specialist not all of them registered dietitians or licensed practitioners meets with the client once a week to monitor weight loss some lowcalorie commercial diet plans call for 500 to 1000 calorie daily diets which is considered lower than is safe for supplying all the nutrients needed for good health according to the recommended daily allowances which set standards for nutrient intake a position paper published in the may issue of the journal of american dietetic assn states that rapid weightloss programs are recommended only for dieters who are at least 30 to 40 overweight wellman stressed that rapid weight loss should be undertaken only with the supervision of a qualified health team the most significant drawback to an unsupervised very low calorie diet is the potential for lifethreatening side effects she said loss of body protein may affect cardiac function and could be related to heart failure eventually all dieters need to learn to be realistic about their food choices wellman said callaway who practices internal medicine endocrinology and metabolism in washington where he is also associate clinical professor of medicine at george washington university medical center expressed similar concerns to the committee if you are going to engage in something potentially hazardous you need to have people who know how to intervene callaway cited the case of some 60 people who had died in the mid1970s shortly after discontinuing their liquid protein diets sudden deaths he said still occur the fact that we have not heard about them until recently reflects our lack of any type of tracking mechanism we have no way of knowing how common these occurances are he said some of the diets out there callaway asserts are ineffective most of the evidence suggests that the more you lose the more quickly you gain callaway told the times oprah winfrey who lost 67 pounds on a liquid diet plan and regained some of it back is often cited as a victim of the yoyo syndrome common to fastloss weight programs the phenomenon of losing and regaining has been scientifically established since the early 20th century callaway said but little of the knowledge has been incorporated into the currently available commercial loss programs low calorie diets callaway explained start out with loss of water which then is retained as the body adapts to starvation the metabolic rate slows down natures way of preserving fat in the face of starvation or famine unfortunately it is accompanied by symptoms that severely compromise ones quality of life callaway said symptoms include fatigue depression dry skin sleeplessness constipation a fall in blood pressure dizziness bloating and even loss of consciousness some studies indicate that with each subsequent attempt at dieting weight loss is slower and rebound weight gain occurs more rapidly starving also leads to stuffing and binge eating as found among bulimia victims callaway called for qualified supervision of weightloss plans at the congressional hearing callaway said that many people successfully diet on their own if they also increase physical activity or cut back on snacks and fats a second alternative is to see a registered dietitian there are more than 50000 registered dietitians who are qualified to provide dietary advice callaway said furthermore rapid weightloss plans should be restricted to individuals who truly need to lose weight for health reasons and who have some medically justifiable indication for losing weight rapidly he said in all cases it is imperative that there be medical supervision and that the medical supervision be competent to monitor the types of complications that are known to occur a number of commercial programs in which physicians are not involved refer to their staff as certified nutrition counselors behavioral therapists or whatever in most cases the only certification comes from the company offering the program consumers have no existing effective mechanism for tracing the incidence and severity of complications due to unsupervised and poorly supervised weight loss programs at present our main recourse is through the media for the victim the only recourse is through civil suits surely we can improve upon this situation callaway told the subcommittee among his other recommendations to the subcommittee hold weightloss programs accountable for their diets outcomes by documenting dietary complications of clients and stop blaming the dieter for their failure establish a registry or clearinghouse for collecting data of adverse effects on clients of commercial diet plans and make the information available to the scientific community for evaluation in his recent book the callaway diet successful permanent weight control for starvers stuffers and skippers bantam books $ 1795 callaway gives reasons why starving stuffing and skipping are counterproductive methods for losing weight he also provides a fourstep personal dieting profile that determines the dieters specific weight loss challenge the book first guides the dieter through a new formula for determining healthiest weight range and body fat distribution secondly it helps define which diet approach will be most effective diet history current metabolic score and eating and activity patterns are determinants the menus developed are for diet levels of 1400 calories 1600 calories 1800 calories and 2000 calories per day with exercise recommended callaway considers the program a sensible approach to dieting because the calories provide the necessary rdas for a balanced diet while allowing overweight individuals to eventually lose weight because they are eating less and exercising more callaways rules for eating 1 eat three regularly scheduled meals a day and no snacks 2 dont skip meals 3 balance meals throughout the day allowing 25 of the calories for breakfast 30 to 35 for lunch and the remainder for dinner 4 drink no alcohol during the first six weeks as alcohol is known to trigger bingeing 5 up to two cups of caffeinated coffee a day are allowed drink tea or coffee without sugar or artificial sweeteners as they can set off bingeing replace diet sodas with mineral water or unsweetened seltzer according to wellman all dieters need to learn to deal with food in a balanced manner with variety and moderation as the keys changing eating habits is a gradual process that requires individualization ongoing monitoring and reinforcement she said dietitians can play a role in helping people make permanent adjustments were the dieters personal cheerleader she said in southern california registered and licensed dietitians can be located through a dietitians referral hot line
