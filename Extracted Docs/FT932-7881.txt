docklands is caught in a trap when it comes to transport on the one hand it wants to secure investment in more and better links by stressing to government the inadequacy of the existing infrastructure on the other it seeks to lure investors by telling them how good its transport is now amid the resulting confusion the overriding impression is that the first of these two versions is correct that the government has let docklands down by failing to provide better transport indeed the developers of canary wharf have directly attributed that projects financial failure to the inadequacy of the links between central london and the isle of dogs but are these criticisms founded on reality or myth to answer the question it is necessary to go back to the beginning of the docklands story it is sometimes forgotten just how modest the governments ambitions for docklands were when it set up the london docklands development corporation to regenerate the area in 1981 then all it foresaw was the construction of 85m sq ft of light industrial premises clearly east londons transport needs had to be looked at afresh but at that time it seemed enough to improve the roads and install the toy town docklands light railway on a shoestring budget of pounds 77m that might have been the end of the story had it not been for the reichmann brothers but when they and their private property company olympia york arrived in 1987 with their grandiose scheme to turn the the isle of dogs into londons third business centre the other two being the west end and the city the transport plans were thrown into chaos considering the scale of the demands being made on it the government reacted with astonishing speed and generosity within months it was carrying out detailed work on the options for improving docklands transport infrastructure the east london rail study was completed and published in january 1989 and in november that same year a bill to authorise construction of the jubilee line extension went before parliament more than pounds 35bn was committed to roads the underground line and the upgrading of the docklands light railway it is true that not all this transport investment went smoothly but then transport investment rarely does services on the docklands light railway for example were continually disrupted by the upgrading programme under pressure from olympia york to do something about the railways poor performance the government eventually stripped control of the line from london transport and installed a new management team headed by sir peter levene the former procurement chief at the ministry of defence worse the jubilee line was never built but that was not the governments fault since it was the canary wharf development that had given rise to the need for the line and since canary wharf would be the main beneficiary of it the government had secured an undertaking from olympia york that the company would make an upfront contribution of pounds 100m towards the lines pounds 18bn construction cost when olympia york collapsed the company defaulted on its agreement and construction of the line has been postponed ever since in other respects however docklands is now looking wellserved by transport the main features of the infrastructure include roads the pounds 165bn roads and river crossings programme is virtually complete with many roads opening ahead of schedule the single most important road the underground limehouse link opened six months ahead of schedule this month greatly improving communications between docklands and the city barely a mile long and costing pounds 255m to build it is reputed to be pro rata one of the most expensive pieces of road in the world docklands light railway initially built for pounds 77m the docklands light railway is now approaching the end of an pounds 800m programme of improvement and expansion it has already been extended to bank in the city an eastwards extension to beckton opens in october and a southward extension across the river to lewisham is planned the line is now performing reliably with capacity greatly increased jubilee line extension the government has pledged that construction of the jubilee line extension from central london to docklands will begin as soon as the private sector produces its promised pounds 100m contribution last month the european investment bank said it was prepared to plug the gap by lending pounds 100m to whoever took over canary wharf from the administrators but the decision is likely to take some time to translate into action london city airport a pounds 5m runway extension made it possible to introduce jet services at the privatelyowned london city airport in docklands last year leading to an expansion of services the airport will also get a boost from the opening of the limehouse link which it claims will put it within a 15minute taxi ride of tower bridge in the city riverbus a fleet of riverbuses provides a novel form of urban transport along the thames between docklands and central london operating at 15minute during peak hours so where does that leave transport in docklands today whatever else it may be it is the envy of the rest of the capital and indeed the rest of the country which has been starved of transport investment to pay for the pounds 35bn being lavished in east london with canary wharf in administration and the rest of docklands blighted by the surpluses overhanging the property market it could reasonably be argued that the real question is no longer whether the amount being spent on transport in the area is too little but whether it is too much office and industrial property housing page 3 a growing community movers and shakers who are helping to make docklands work page 4
