its known simply as the play cals fivelateral kickoff return for a touchdown through the stanford band which gave the golden bears a 2520 victory over stanford in 1982 while stanfords dramatic 2725 win in saturdays 93rd big game which came on john hopkins 39yard field goal as time expired wasnt as bizarre it was almost as absurd i remember the play and i guess you could call this the play ii said stanford running back glyn milburn who rushed for 196 yards and one touchdown trailing 2518 stanford drove 87 yards to a touchdown with quarterback jason palumbis hitting split end ed mccaffrey with a 19yard touchdown pass with 12 seconds remaining to cut the score to 2524 then it got strange the cardinal went for a twopoint conversion to win the game but defensive back john hardy intercepted palumbis pass in the end zone and cals fans thinking the game was over engulfed the memorial stadium field hardy ran through the crowd exchanging highfives with rooters on his way to the tunnel that leads to the locker room but 12 seconds remained after the crowd was cleared cal was assessed a 15yard penalty for delay of game by referee pat flood who had earlier threatened to award stanford the twopoint conversion unless the field was cleared of fans who had left the stands in anticipation of a victory celebration the rule states that if the team which includes substitutes band members and cheerleaders come on the field a penalty can be assessed flood said we cant penalize the crowd cal had quite a few players on the field and the coaches were trying to hold them back some of them were all the way over near the stanford sideline they thought the game was over for some reason while it can be argued that the play wouldnt have been possible without the stanford band which had spilled onto the field during the chaotic fivelateral kickoff return cal coach bruce snyder refused to blame cals overzealous fans for contributing to the loss i had no idea what the crowd was going to do snyder said but i just want to go on record as saying that over the course of this year fan support particularly in the student section has been outstanding in a way they get credit for the improvement of cals football team and i appreciate the hell out of them kicking off from the 50 instead of the 35 hopkins dribbled a kick along the right sideline although several cal players had a chance to recover stanford defensive back kevin scott covered it at the cal 37 with nine seconds left scott admitted later that he was out of bounds when he recovered the kick my feet were out of bounds but my knees were in bounds scott said but its too late to give it back theres no instant replay in college football palumbis who passed for 253 yards and one touchdown threw an incomplete pass on first down but cal was penalized for roughing the passer when nose guard john belli hit palumbis after he had released the ball giving stanford a first down at the cal 22 with five seconds left its tough to tell right now until i look at the films belli said of the call im an aggressive player and it was an obvious passing down i was just trying to get some heat on the quarterback i didnt realize it was late when i hit him i was going full steam i didnt really hit him i sort of ran through him snyder thought it was a bad call it wasnt a good call snyder said whether legitimate or not the officials determine that the referees job is to protect the quarterback and he made his judgment palumbis disagreed saying the call came immediately so i think it was a good call the 15yard penalty moved stanford into fieldgoal range for hopkins who had made kicks of 26 29 47 and 22 yards earlier in the game so instead of a 53yard field goal hopkins trotted onto the field and hit a 39yarder to beat the golden bears i knew it was good right away but it was a tough kick because it was into the wind hopkins said stanford coach dennis green made sure that the stanford band wouldnt determine the outcome of this game sending extra security guards to police the band and ensure that the musicians wouldnt leave the stands until the game was over i had my no 1 security guy make sure the band wasnt on the field and i had my no 2 security guy make sure no players were on the field because i wasnt sure if there was any time left on the clock green said until it turned into a theater of the absurd cal tailbacks russell white and anthony wallace dominated the game white who rushed for 177 yards and two touchdowns finished the regular season with 1000 yards wallace who gained 99 yards ended the regular season with 1002 white gave cal a 2518 lead when he scored his second touchdown on an eightyard run with 603 left to cap an 88yard drive after cal forced stanford to punt on the ensuing series it appeared that the golden bears 641 431 would run out the final 416 but cal was unable to kill the clock punting to stanford 56 44 with two minutes left after taking over at his 13 palumbis made a brilliant play to keep the drive alive on fourth and six at the stanford 35 hitting wide receiver chris walsh with a 17yard pass over the middle with 56 seconds left six plays later palumbis connected with mccaffrey for the touchdown
