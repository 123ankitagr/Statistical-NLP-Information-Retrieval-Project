the bundesbank yesterday tight-ened its money supply growth targets for next year but stressed this was not a signal for a more restrictive interest rates policy mr hans tietmeyer president in a modestly upbeat review of economic and monetary conditions also suggested inflation was weakening and reinforced economists expectations that the recent series of small interest rate cuts would be resumed early in the new year the bank's central council fixed the 1994 target range for annualised expansion of the key m3 measure at 4-6 per cent compared with 4.5 6.5 per cent this year as expected it left the bundesbank's key discount rate unchanged at 5.75 per cent a surprise surge in monetary growth in november announced yesterday demonstrated that the bank still has grounds for concern m3 its most trusted indicator of future inflation grew at an annualised rate of 7.2 per cent up from 6.9 per cent in october mr tietmeyer said that although the economy was in a difficult transition phase and the correction of structural problems in the west needed time inflation was weakening and the east no longer relied solely on cash transfers from the west he said the bank would assess any scope for rate reductions the discount rate has been cut six times this year paring it from 8.25 per cent in january to 5.75 per cent now mr otmar issing the bank's top economist suggested west german inflation could fall below 3 per cent in the course of the new year compared with the latest figure of 3.6 per cent the average rate of price increases for 1994 would still be above 3 per cent he warned and there was always a danger to import prices from the possible appreciation of the us dollar or higher costs of oil yesterday's decisions although criticised by trade unions and opposition politicians as brakes on the economic recovery were widely welcomed by industry and the financial community the tighter m3 target range underscored the bank's determination to maintain monetary stability according to the confederation of german industry it allowed room for further interest cuts and ensured enough liquidity for tension-free economic growth the confederation added mr tietmeyer said one main factor persuading the bank to lower its targets was reduced potential for economic growth the 1993 range allowed for growth of up to 3 per cent while the new figures assumed 2.5 per cent next year falling capital investment and decisions by some manufacturers to base new plant outside germany had reduced potential the notional inflation rate allowed for was unchanged at 2 per cent government bonds page 29 currency markets page 31
