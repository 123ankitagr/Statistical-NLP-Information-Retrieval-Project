Veteran Central Washington University basketball Coach Dean Nicholson resigned today after an internal review found that some money raised through basketball camps was improperly given to student athletes . Nicholson , 63 , has coached at Central Washington for 26 years and is one of only 17 college coaches to reach 600 lifetime victories . He said his resignation as coach and as a professor of physical education was effective immediately . An anonymous whistle-blower had complained that income generated by a basketball camp was distributed to student athletes at Central in violation of state and federal regulations , the university said in a news release .
