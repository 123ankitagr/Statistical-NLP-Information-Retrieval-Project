sir michael smith's article future of sizewell c rests on 3.7 p claim june 21 leaves me with the fear that the uk nuclear review will degenerate into a battle of numbers results of cost calculations for large projects depend on a host of assumptions with many having a big effect on the outcome by the choice of a judicious mixture of assumptions all within the plausible range one can get any result one wishes we are left with all parties claiming that their numbers are correct and the others wrong rather than such a battle which usually generates much heat but little light there are many fundamental issues surrounding nuclear energy which need debate just to mention two whether justified or not there is a considerable public opposition to nuclear energy in other countries germany us sweden this has led to political parties taking different views resulting in near-paralysis can one have a successful nuclear industry in a democracy unless there is a degree of consensus such as exists in france and japan and is this achievable in the uk a highly competitive market structure of many players which appears to be the aim of present government thinking tends to lead away from long-term strategic decisions to greater emphasis on short-term profit maximisation it is not clear how expansion of nuclear energy with its large unit investment long delay between decision and start-up and its many political risks can fit into such a model unless government decides to affect commercial decisions by reducing commercial risks and that raises the issue of government role can investment in electricity be left to the play of short-term market forces or is there need for a strategic steer if the latter who except government can should provide it there are strong differences of views on such points their debate will be more illuminating about the future role of nuclear power in the uk and how to achieve it than arcane arguments about relative cost advantages of hypothetical power plants during the first 30 years of the next century peter beck associate fellow royal institute of international affairs 10 st james's square london sw1
