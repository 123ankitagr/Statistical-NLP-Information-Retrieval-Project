a week ago number 47 winchester avenue was a comfortable family house in one of sydneys affluent north shore suburbs today it is a charred wreck razed to its foundations the owners have fled and only the ornamental plantholders which bizarrely survived the weekends bushfires undamaged hint at the home that once was a few yards down the road number 53 has been luckier the lowslung residence is still intact although the weekend blaze licked at its doors however while the building was once perched on a leafy hillside its outlook now comprises burnt undergrowth and blackened trees a smell of charcoal hangs in the air and carpetcleaning vans line the street at least were still standing remarks one resident stoically as she scrubs at matting in the 30degree heat these inhabitants of west lindfield are only a small portion of the new south wales residents totting up damage from the past weeks bushfires the infernos the worst to hit the state in more than a century have left four people dead several hundred injured and almost 200 buildings destroyed viewed from the air the royal national park a 15000hectare expanse just to the south of sydney resembles a huge black smudge across the state more than 600000 hectares are reckoned to have burnt even now it is hard to say with any certainty that the worst is over all week the authorities have urged against complacency and yesterday the nsw bush fire services warned that the situation remains fairly volatile more than 100 fires are still burning although half are not viewed as dangerous and the main focus has shifted away from sydney to the gosper mountainwollemi national park area to the north of the city weather forecasts offer only moderate encouragement while storms are predicted they are not expected to have a significant dousing effect and lightning strikes could yet hamper the firefighters task a smokerelated haze hangs across sydney pushing pollution indices to about 10 times their normal level meanwhile questions about new south wales handling of the disaster are already being asked no one queries the dedication and skill with which firefighters tackled the blazes but there are suggestions that inadequate forward preparation allowed the disaster to get out of hand the problem is that nsw rarely suffers from long dry spells and the 10day stretch which led up to this weeks fires was highly unusual nevertheless in a 199293 report the states department of bush fire services warned that other government agencies should review their fire prevention and public education strategies mr phil koperberg commissioner of the nsw bush fire services added that he was duty bound to express concern about the lack of action being taken to reduce hazards he pointed out that much of the eastern part of the state was heavily forested and produced high levels of combustible material there continues to be an alarming downturn in both the quantity and quality of those elements of fire management practices designed to reduce the amount of such fuels he suggested this week both mr koperberg and mr terry griffiths the nsw police minister played down this prophetic caution saying that no one had urged an urgent response and that immediate action would have been impossible given the approaching summer season anyway but this rejoinder has not deterred calls for a reassessment of nsws firemanagement practices on wednesday mr griffiths conceded that a review will almost certainly take place but as the damage assessment is made a few brighter spots are emerging estimates of the cost to the insurance industry are being scaled back for example the insurance council of australia the main industry group said yesterday it now expected insured claims to total between adollars 50m pounds 24m and adollars 100m with most of this stemming from residential rather than commercial policies to date ica members report about 877 claims for an expected payout of adollars 40m this compares with estimates earlier in the week of adollars 150m and contrasts favourably with other recent catastrophes the 1983 ash wednesday fires in victoria and south australia for example cost insurers about adollars 400m in the us hurricane andrew which ripped through florida and louisiana in august 1992 and was the nations costliest disaster brought a insurance bill of usdollars 15bn pounds 10bn that said insurers admit that it is still hard to assess the degree to which affected homeowners may have been either underinsured or without insurance altogether the ica reckons that about 10 per cent of australians lack property insurance but acknowledges that the figure can vary enormously between areas its too early to make an assessment commented one official he added that member companies had received hundreds of phonecalls from residents in both sydney and melbourne checking up on coverage levels for the future
