fletcher challenge is to write down its australian and new zealand property portfolio by nzdollars 400m usdollars 215m in a move that will force an unexpected loss on the company for this year it says that the write down intended to comply with international accounting practices will push the company into a loss of about nzdollars 155m for the year ending june 1992 instead of a predicted nzdollars 300m profit the news stunned the new zealand stock market analysts had been braced for a writedown at the companys 48 per cent owned australian property arm jennings however analysts had not expected write downs on the companys other property involvements mr hugh fletcher chief executive said the writedown did not represent cash outflows and would not affect the groups ability to pay a prudent dividend the board expects to pay a total dividend of 14 cents compared with 27 cents in 199091 included in the writedown is some nzdollars 50m as a result of the decision by the jennings group to write off adollars 74m usdollars 5692m of its involvement in the adollars 650m southgate development in melbourne fletcher challenge said this provoked it to write off nzdollars 350m from its other property investments that represents 29 cents a share or eight per cent of net asset backing the group forecast an endjune asset backing of nzdollars 413 per share yearend assets per share will now be nzdollars 370 broadly in line with the nzdollars 368 of end 199091 a main reason for the heavy writedown was a wish to conform with us accounting practices as far as new zealand accounting standards and law would allow mr fletcher said that the increasing overseas ownership in the company which now stands at 40 per cent and the overseas origin of debt were related factors he said the writedown would allow investors to focus on the groups competitive strength and the potential for recovery in its four businesses of pulp and paper energy building and rural servicing secure in the knowledge that adequate provision had been made for the groups property exposures mr fletcher said that the company still expected to sell nzdollars 750m worth of assets this year there were no plans for future cash issues next years results were expected to benefit from improvements in most markets he said
