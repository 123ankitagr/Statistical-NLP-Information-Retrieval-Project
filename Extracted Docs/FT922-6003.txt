fletcher challenge is to write down its australian and new zealand property portfolio by nzdollars 400 m usdollars 215 m in a move that will force an unexpected loss on the company for this year it says that the write down intended to comply with international accounting practices will push the company into a loss of about nzdollars 155 m for the year ending june 1992, instead of a predicted nzdollars 300 m profit the news stunned the new zealand stock market analysts had been braced for a write-down at the company's 48 per cent owned australian property arm jennings however analysts had not expected write downs on the company's other property involvements mr hugh fletcher chief executive said the write-down did not represent cash outflows and would not affect the group's ability to pay a prudent dividend the board expects to pay a total dividend of 14 cents compared with 27 cents in 1990-91 included in the write-down is some nzdollars 50 m as a result of the decision by the jennings group to write off adollars 74 m usdollars 56.92 m of its involvement in the adollars 650 m southgate development in melbourne fletcher challenge said this provoked it to write off nzdollars 350 m from its other property investments that represents 29 cents a share or eight per cent of net asset backing the group forecast an end-june asset backing of nzdollars 4.13 per share year-end assets per share will now be nzdollars 3.70 broadly in line with the nzdollars 3.68 of end 1990-91 a main reason for the heavy write-down was a wish to conform with us accounting practices as far as new zealand accounting standards and law would allow mr fletcher said that the increasing overseas ownership in the company which now stands at 40 per cent and the overseas origin of debt were related factors he said the write-down would allow investors to focus on the group's competitive strength and the potential for recovery in its four businesses of pulp and paper energy building and rural servicing secure in the knowledge that adequate provision had been made for the group's property exposures mr fletcher said that the company still expected to sell nzdollars 750 m worth of assets this year there were no plans for future cash issues next year's results were expected to benefit from improvements in most markets he said
