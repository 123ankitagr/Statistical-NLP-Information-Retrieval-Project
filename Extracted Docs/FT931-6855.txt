if you are not domiciled in the uk you will not pay tax on any income or property which you earn or own outside the country but if you buy a house or property in britain you could become liable to uk tax on the money needed for the purchase on any profit made when you sell it or if you die while owning it there are however legitimate ways of avoiding these levies if you need to bring in money to buy a house the best way is to do this before you become uk-resident then no tax is due but if you cannot there are ways of converting a fund mixed with untaxed income and gains into one that is non-taxable examples include setting up a back-to-back loan making a gift offshore or creating an offshore trust if you have brought in substantial sums of money from a mixed fund you could be liable to tax already although it could be difficult to work out how much in my experience however the inland revenue is fair in such circumstances and often willing to negotiate if you co-operate once you have decided how to buy your house you should consider whether you will have to pay capital gains tax if you profit from selling it if you plan to live there it could be exempt from tax as your main or only residence but if you have another residence anywhere else in the world you should ask the revenue to treat your new house as your tax-exempt residence this request should be made within two years of buying the property after that the revenue could decide not to accept your choice if the exemption is not available you might consider buying the property through a non-uk trust cgt is not charged on gains made by an offshore trust set up by a non-uk domiciled settlor the next thing to consider is inheritance tax if you are going to buy the house in your own name or in the name of an offshore trust then inheritance tax at a maximum rate of 40 per cent will be payable when you die unless you leave the property to your spouse if you decide not to do this or are concerned that you and your spouse could die together you can take out term insurance especially if your stay in the uk is unlikely to be long say five years at the most if this solution fails to suit you can avoid iht simply by owning the house through an offshore company you will then effectively have swapped a uk chargeable asset your house for a non-uk non-chargeable asset shares in the offshore company in theory this solution is simple but in practice there are disadvantages you must not for example be seen to be managing or controlling the company from britain if you do you will make it uk-resident and defeat the purpose another pitfall is an income tax charge under the benefit-in-kind legislation the revenue has said it will levy tax if you live in a property owned by an offshore company if you are either a director either in name or in effect or own it tax charged is particularly onerous and is based on the cost of the house if over pounds 75,000 and the rate of interest at the time many tax experts believe the revenue is wrong to levy this charge but while the threat is there it should where possible be avoided this usually can be achieved by not being a director of the company and transferring your shares in the company to an offshore trust again care must be taken over the trust to which you transfer your shares if you use an existing trust containing accumulated income you might find yourself being taxed on that income because of the benefit to you of the uk accommodation if you want to let the house the rental income will be taxable since it arises in the uk this can be avoided by taking out a loan from a uk bank or an offshore branch of a uk bank but not a building society to buy the property the interest can then be set off against the rent and the money which otherwise you would have used to buy the property can be deposited offshore generating an income which will be tax-free because it is outside the uk there are many ways of avoiding tax even on uk-situated assets if you are not domiciled in britain but make certain you are not otherwise you could face a larger tax bill than if you had done nothing at all caroline garnham is a tax and trusts specialist at city solicitor simmons simmons
