a state retirement age of 65 for both men and women could be twice as expensive for the government as harmonising the age at 60 according to the trades union congress in a response to last weeks recommendation by the social security advisory committee of a pension age of 65 the tuc also says that equalising the age at 60 is the most socially progressive option and takes account of social trends and peoples wishes the advisory committee had agreed with the government that raising the retirement age of women from 60 to 65 the same as for men would save roughly pounds 3bn a year in additional expenditure however the tuc says in a letter to mr peter lilley social security secretary that independent calculations produced for it show that the 65 choice might cost pounds 14bn the cost of equalising the age at 60 might be pounds 700m to arrive at the pounds 700m cost for a retirement age of 60 the tuc has assumed that economic activity rates for men aged between 60 and 65 will eventually fall to 30 per cent from the present 53 per cent in arriving at the pounds 14bn figure for equalising at 65 the tuc assumes the proportion of women retiring after 60 would increase to about the same as for men it also assumes that about half of the jobs filled by women who postpone retirement would otherwise have been available to job seekers mr norman willis tuc general secretary says on this basis an increase in the state pension age for women actually increases the net cost to the economy as a whole mr willis says that although it is not possible to say with any certainty which figures are correct the tucs figures are certainly within the bounds of possibility
