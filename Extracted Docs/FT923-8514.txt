A STATE retirement age of 65 for both men and women could be twice as expensive for the government as harmonising the age at 60 , according to the Trades Union Congress . In a response to last week 's recommendation by the Social Security Advisory Committee of a pension age of 65 , the TUC also says that equalising the age at 60 is the most socially progressive option and takes account of social trends and people 's wishes . The advisory committee had agreed with the government that raising the retirement age of women from 60 to 65 , the same as for men , would save roughly Pounds 3bn a year in additional expenditure . However , the TUC says in a letter to Mr Peter Lilley , social security secretary , that independent calculations produced for it show that the 65 choice might cost Pounds 1.4bn . The cost of equalising the age at 60 might be Pounds 700m . To arrive at the Pounds 700m cost for a retirement age of 60 , the TUC has assumed that economic activity rates for men aged between 60 and 65 will eventually fall to 30 per cent from the present 53 per cent . In arriving at the Pounds 1.4bn figure for equalising at 65 , the TUC assumes the proportion of women retiring after 60 would increase to about the same as for men . It also assumes that about half of the jobs filled by women who postpone retirement would otherwise have been available to job seekers . Mr Norman Willis , TUC general secretary , says : 'On this basis , an increase in the state pension age for women actually increases the net cost to the economy as a whole . ' Mr Willis says that although it is not possible to say with any certainty which figures are correct , 'the TUC 's figures are certainly within the bounds of possibility ' .
