british aerospace yesterday signed an agreement with taiwanese officials on the financial structure of a proposed joint venture to build regional jet aircraft the deal came on the fifth day of intensive talks between a team led by mr john cahill baes chairman and taiwanese bankers politicians and industrialists the venture marks a breakthrough for mr cahills strategy to improve baes profitability the rj series of aircraft that the joint venture will build partly in taiwan currently loses money for bae the turning point in the tough negotiations came on wednesday when mr cahill and mr liang kuoshu chairman of taiwans state owned chiao tung bank initialled a draft financial structure for the venture called avro international aerospace they then sent that draft on its tortuous journey through a series of politicians and bank officials who needed to give their approval the final stage a nod from mr lien chan taiwans prime minister came yesterday the agreement was signed by mr cahill mr liang and mr hou chunhsiung chairman of taiwan aerospace corporation tac bae s manufacturing partner in the venture it marked the end of a tough week for both sides taiwans top bankers and politicians professions which sometimes overlap in taiwan had just emerged from a turbulent congress of the ruling party the kuomintang mr cahill and mr charles masefield president of baes regional jet division had cut short summer holidays at the weekend to fly in from the us and europe respectively a hectic series of meetings began at 7am on monday morning for the next twoandahalf days baes fivestrong team visited lawyers bankers politicians and industrialists in their offices dotted about taipei the talks were essentially over fears within the taiwanese banking consortium planning to lend money to avro that the venture was too risky these fears were based on the knowledge that the rj series of aircraft that avro would build partly in taiwan had lost money for bae there were also concerns that an associated aircraft leasing company would suffer a repeat of troubles experienced by western aircraft leasing companies such as gpa however the agreement involves an effective taiwan government guarantee of loans to avro bae also agreed that the leasing facility of substantially more than dollars 250m would only be tapped when firm orders for the aircraft came in there was little inkling last january when the original contract was signed that there lay ahead a gruelling struggle to convince taiwanese banks to lend to avro it was almost three months after the january signing of the contracts that problems began to emerge mr hou of tac fell seriously ill and was unable to work for more than three months useducated mr denny ko tacs president was left in control of the company but he had come from a us corporate environment having worked for los angeles aerospace company trw and run his own company in california by his own admission he found the transition more difficult than he had expected relations between tac and the consortium of banks slated to lend money to avro began to deteriorate by midsummer the government stepped in to save the deal from collapse at the end of july in an attempt to improve the banks confidence in the deal the government officially backed avro but it was not enough and talks between middleranking uk and taiwanese negotiating teams in taiwan stalled this triggered a series of exchanges between mr cahill and senior taiwanese politicians that culminated last weekend in the arrival from various continents of baes top management in spite of yesterdays signing compromises have yet to be worked out on some of the nonfinancial conditions these differences and the incorporation of the chaio tung bank into existing contractual arrangements between bae and tac are to be completed at meetings in london on september 6 after that the way should be clear for taiwan to begin working on rjs in the spring of 1994 at bae it is a lifeline for the rj programme which began life in the late 1970s as the bae 146 its early days were dogged with technical difficulties and the company struggled to improve the reliability of the aircraft by 1991 reliability had reached international standards but competition from the likes of dutch company fokker and a growing recession didnt help sales at the start of 1992 therefore bae decided to seek international partners hitting almost by accident on taiwan just as a proposed joint venture between taiwan and us aircraft manufacturer mcdonnell douglas began to founder mr cahill made his first visit to taiwan in may 1992 in january 1993 he and mr ko signed a manufacturing agreement in london but it was only yesterday that the financial structure of avro was resolved for taiwan the offer from bae came at an opportune time some of the difficulties with the mcdonnell douglas proposals did not apply with bae its aircraft were proven designs the investment would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars rather than billions and there was a larger potential market among domestic carriers flying short trips across taiwans rugged countryside and as one leading taiwanese lawyer put it this week two failed attempts to set up an aerospace joint venture looks bad
