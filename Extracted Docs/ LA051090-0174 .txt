Another senior executive at Columbia Savings & Loan is leaving the troubled Beverly Hills thrift . Daniel C. Rohr , Columbia 's executive vice president and chief credit officer , will join First Bank System in Minneapolis on May 21 as executive vice president and manager of the bank 's commercial banking group . A former Continental Bank executive , Rohr , 44 , will work for First Bank Chairman John F. Grundhofer , formerly Wells Fargo 's top Los Angeles executive . Rohr 's job at Columbia , which he joined in September , 1988 , included monitoring credit problems in the troubled junk bond portfolio . He was also one of six executives who , along with former CEO Thomas Spiegel , once ran the thrift in a partner-like manner . Columbia 's portfolio of high-yield junk bonds and preferred stock has plunged by more than $ 1 billion in value over the past year , rendering the thrift insolvent and putting it in danger of being seized by regulators . Other top executive who have left Columbia or announced their resignations include Spiegel , former President Lawrence K. Fish , former Chief Financial Officer James A . D'Aquila and David A. Sachs , a Columbia executive vice president whose resignation is effective Friday . JAMES BATES
