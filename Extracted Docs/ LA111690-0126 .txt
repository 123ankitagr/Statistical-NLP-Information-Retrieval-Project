Bondholders ' representatives have threatened a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing for Atlantic City 's biggest casino as early as today . At press time , there were no signs whether the developer and the holders of $ 675 million in junk bonds were near an agreement to restructure the debt . The Trump Organization was saying very little . Telephones at Trump 's New York headquarters went unanswered late Thursday .
