well it has happened again there was another story of how an athlete has overcome his drug and alcohol addiction to once again perform up to his potential it wasnt too long ago that the times featured houston mctear and how well he was doing but when he was arrested and charged with drug possession there were only a couple of lines now there is this story about orlando woolridge i hope that all of these people really do make it on their roads to recovery but doesnt the newspaper do them a big disservice and put pressure on them by saying that they have recovered the truth is that they are only recovering harvey j glass sherman oaks editors note in neither the mctear story nor the woolridge story did the times say or even suggest that either athlete was recovered from his drug problem only that each was trying to deal with it the times too hopes that those with drug problems really do make it on their roads to recovery but is not so naive as to believe that they are anything more than recovering
