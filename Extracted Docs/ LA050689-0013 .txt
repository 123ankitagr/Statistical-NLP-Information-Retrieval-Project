Well , it has happened again . There was another story of how an athlete has overcome his drug and alcohol addiction to once again perform up to his `` potential . '' It was n't too long ago that The Times featured Houston McTear and how well he was doing . But when he was arrested and charged with drug possession , there were only a couple of lines . Now there is this story about Orlando Woolridge . I hope that all of these people really do make it on their roads to recovery , but does n't the newspaper do them a big disservice and put pressure on them by saying that they have recovered ? The truth is that they are only recovering . HARVEY J . GLASS Sherman Oaks Editor 's note : In neither the McTear story nor the Woolridge story did The Times say , or even suggest , that either athlete was recovered from his drug problem , only that each was trying to deal with it . The Times , too , hopes that those with drug problems really do make it on their roads to recovery but is not so naive as to believe that they are anything more than recovering .
