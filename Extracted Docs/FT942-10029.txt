united microelectronics a taiwanese semiconductor manufacturer backed by the taiwan government has filed actions in taiwan and france disputing a critical microprocessor patent held by intel the worlds largest chip maker and the dominant supplier of microprocessors to the personal computer industry the umc actions coincide with the longdelayed introduction by the taiwanese company of a clone of one of intels topselling microprocessors the intel 486 intel makes about 80 per cent of microprocessors that go into pcs and has vigorously defended its property rights against other chip makers facing a likely legal challenge from intel umc took preemptive action said robert tsao umc chairman applying in france and taiwan to have one of intels patents invalidated in those countries mr tsao said umc intends to file similar actions in other countries anywhere they have 338 patent registered we will invalidate it he said intel officials in the us said they have had no official contact with umc but the us company plans to obtain samples of the umc chips and will analyse them to determine if there is any infringement of patents or trade secrets intel said it has broad international patent protection on its microprocessors and that umc is not licensed to use any intel technology in interviews last september umc officials said they would not sell in the us market when they introduced their microprocessor chip in order to avoid legal challenges from intel the primary target of umcs efforts is taiwans large personal computer motherboard industry dozens of taiwanese companies produce the main circuit boards that go inside personal computers for us and european computer companies the umc chip called the u5s green chip is a relatively slow version of a 486 microprocessor suitable for lowend personal computers umc said that it expects sales of its new chip to reach tdollars 800m dollars 30m this year and tdollars 2bn next year
