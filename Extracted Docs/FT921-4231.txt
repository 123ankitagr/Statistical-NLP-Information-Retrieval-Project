Businessmen in the former Soviet Union have offered to sell heavy water , which can be used to make atomic bombs , to a Norwegian company , Norway's foreign ministry said yesterday , Reuter reports from Oslo . It is not illegal for a Norwegian company to purchase heavy water ( deuterium oxide ) but all exports and help to negotiate sales are forbidden . The ministry said Norway was probably a transit country for heavy water exports . Meanwhile , a Russian minister promised yesterday to tighten border controls after two citizens were caught trying to sell 1.2 kg of low-grade uranium in Germany .
