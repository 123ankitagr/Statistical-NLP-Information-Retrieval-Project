Although it does n't include all of Arthur C. Clarke 's stories about Earth ( `` No Morning After '' and `` The Nine Billion Names of God '' are among the notable omissions ) , `` Tales '' offers some of the writer 's finest work from the '50s and '60s . `` The Road to the Sea '' and `` The Lion of Comarre '' represent early explorations of the link between cultural stagnation and technological advance , a theme Clarke would develop more fully in `` The City and the Stars . '' The bizarre surprise ending of `` The Other Tiger '' and the disastrously successful media hype in `` Publicity Campaign '' stand out as examples of the deliciously black humor that enables Clarke to end the world , not with a bang but a snigger .
