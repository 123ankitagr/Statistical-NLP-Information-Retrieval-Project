The Big West Conference , which recently was released from its contract with Prime Ticket because of scheduling conflicts , has reached an agreement with SportsChannel . Sources said SportsChannel will pay $ 3.4 million over six years for the rights to 52 events a year , highlighted by 10 football games and 20 men 's basketball games . But there is some controversy over how that money will be divided . Creative Sports Marketing , a North Carolina-based company owned by Bray Cary , has been negotiating the TV rights for the Big West . Cary 's competitors claim that by the time the contract expires , Cary 's company will have received an unusually high 50 % of the rights fees , or $ 1.7 million , shortchanging the member schools . Robert L. Schibel , a Los Angeles-based attorney representing unnamed parties identified only as concerned taxpayers , recently sent letters to presidents of the Big West schools threatening legal action . Schibel said the Big West Conference did not seek competitive bids for its television rights . Opponents of the SportsChannel deal also point out that the Big West 's exposure has been reduced from 4.1 million homes , Prime Ticket 's subscriber base , to about 100,000 , which reportedly is SportsChannel 's base . However , in a prepared statement , Big West Commissioner James Haney said : `` The Big West Conference is extremely pleased to have its teams showcased on SportsChannel , and we look forward to a long and rewarding relationship . '' The deal also includes the California Raisin Bowl , plus baseball , women 's basketball and volleyball . LARRY STEWART
