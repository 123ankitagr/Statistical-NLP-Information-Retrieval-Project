there were plenty of thank-yous to throw around after the angels 5-0 victory over the new york yankees sunday manager doug rader thanked right fielder claudell washington for his sprawling sixth-inning catch of a steve sax line drive a greg louganis dive-and-slide that stretched every muscle in washington's 34-year-old body you don't think about it age when you're taking off after the ball said a sore washington afterward washington then thanked rader for showing such compassion during the right fielder's recent personal ordeal in which washington's 15-year-old daughter camille was nearly paralyzed after a freak domestic accident washington's appearance sunday was his first since april 29 and his first since the accident on may 2 he was on the road when camille was injured and immediately flew home to orinda calif to be with his daughter washington rejoined the team friday but sat out the first two games of the series she's coming along fine washington said of his daughter who bruised her brain stem when a lamp struck her on the back of the neck she's taking therapy now and she's going to start to swim a little bit to get her legs back because she can't walk from here to there without losing her balance they figure the swimming pool will strengthen her legs in a couple of weeks she'll be up and at em that's what they say the first reports weren't as encouraging it was tough washington said we're just happy she's not paralyzed that's what they were worried about and for four days she was this mind you wasn't your average household accident she was making a bed doing her regular housework he explained and she was pulling the cover up over the pillow she was down on her knees got caught in the lamp cord and pulled it down and hit her in the spinal column it was a big dresser lamp i was telling her that it could only happen to her she's so fragile she's an athlete but she's a little fragile too washington was out of the lineup for more than two weeks but said the angels insisted he not return until camille was out of danger washington wondered whether other teams would have showed as much compassion it did surprise me he said because i think if i'd been on the other side in new york well i don't know what might have happened washington played two and a half seasons with the yankees before signing with the angels as a free agent over the winter i'd hate to even think about it if i was still with the yankees he said it was better just to take things out on his former teammates washington who also added a fourth-inning single in sunday's victory said he stayed in frequent contact with the angels while he was away i've been real happy about the way they've handled it he said because i was concerned it wasn't tough for me to come back once she got out of the hospital i was just waiting for her to be released and for them doctors to tell me everything was fine once they did that i was ready to come back and it wasn't a bad comeback washington's catch was drawing raves around the locker room washington tried to compliment left fielder chili davis on his fine running catch of a tom brookens fly ball in the second inning yours was sweeter davis shot back and washington couldn't argue it was a 10, he said of his catch it was good to be back
