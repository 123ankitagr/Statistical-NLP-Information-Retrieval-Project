GOLDMAN SACHS , one of Wall Street 's leading investment banks , has developed a commodity index that it hopes will lure more institutional investors into the often topsy-turvy futures markets . The index provides a needed performance benchmark for investors , according to Mr Timothy O'Neill , a Goldman Sachs partner , and this should help increase the attraction of commodities as an asset class . The Goldman Sachs Commodity Index ( GSCI ) will include futures on 18 physical commodities and will measure total return , including both price change and yield , with comparisons to returns from equities and bonds . Energy and food products account for nearly 90 per cent of its value , with industrial and precious metals making up the balance . The GSCI is intended as an aid for investors to hedge their portfolio risks against inflation and , because commodities are countercyclical to returns on bonds and equities , provide some portfolio insurance against drops in other markets . Many institutional investors have hesitated to make commodity investments because of the 'speculative , fighter-pilot image ' of the industry , said Mr O'Neill . But these apprehensions can be put to rest by an index that measures the performance of these markets just as other indices do for bonds and equities , he said . The GSCI will compete with an index by the Commodity Research Bureau , a division of the Knight Ridder Financial Publishing Group , and an index by Dow Jones . Goldman Sachs may also develop products such as an investment fund based on the GSCI . Through its J. Aron Currency and Commodities Division , the bank is one of the world 's largest trading and advisory firms in the markets for petroleum products and precious and industrial metals .
