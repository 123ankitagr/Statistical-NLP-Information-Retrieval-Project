goldman sachs one of wall street's leading investment banks has developed a commodity index that it hopes will lure more institutional investors into the often topsy-turvy futures markets the index provides a needed performance benchmark for investors according to mr timothy o'neill a goldman sachs partner and this should help increase the attraction of commodities as an asset class the goldman sachs commodity index gsci will include futures on 18 physical commodities and will measure total return including both price change and yield with comparisons to returns from equities and bonds energy and food products account for nearly 90 per cent of its value with industrial and precious metals making up the balance the gsci is intended as an aid for investors to hedge their portfolio risks against inflation and because commodities are countercyclical to returns on bonds and equities provide some portfolio insurance against drops in other markets many institutional investors have hesitated to make commodity investments because of the speculative fighter-pilot image of the industry said mr o'neill but these apprehensions can be put to rest by an index that measures the performance of these markets just as other indices do for bonds and equities he said the gsci will compete with an index by the commodity research bureau a division of the knight ridder financial publishing group and an index by dow jones goldman sachs may also develop products such as an investment fund based on the gsci through its j aron currency and commodities division the bank is one of the world's largest trading and advisory firms in the markets for petroleum products and precious and industrial metals
