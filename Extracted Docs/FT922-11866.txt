THE COMMODITY Futures Trading Commission has approved the New York Commodity Exchange ( Comex ) as a contract market for Dubai sour crude futures . The contract will be traded in open outcry and will use an mutual offset system in co-operation with the International Petroleum Exchange in London . This system will allow market users to enter or exit positions on either exchange during their respective market hours . Mr Donna Redel , Comex 's newly-elected chairman , said that the contract was important for the exchange 's plans to diversify . Its launch , however , is not expected soon and will be co-ordinated with the IPE .
