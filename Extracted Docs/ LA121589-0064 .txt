Still in his 20s , New Yorker Gary Simmons is certainly an artist to watch . His series of conceptually based three-dimensional pieces with schoolroom themes are acute visual metaphors that circle around education and political freedom . Rows of pint-sized rostrums each outfitted with a microphone tilted at the same angle ( `` Private Schoolroom '' ) suggest thoughts about the ubiquity of mass communications , the fragility of First Amendment rights and the power of children -- as vocal consumers today , full-fledged voters tomorrow . An elementary school coat rack holding neatly aligned midget-sized Ku Klux Klan hoods and robes ( `` Six X '' ) gives one pause : Imagine , a new generation of tidy little bigots , already inculcated with perverse beliefs . `` Disinformation Paragraph , '' a wall piece , consists of different-sized framed lengths of blank chalkboard arranged like words in a paragraph . Any message one might write with the pieces of black chalk is only temporary , subject to swift eradication or alteration -- as is disinformation , the false information leaked by a government as part of its intelligence operations .
