Foreign ship orders received by Japanese shipbuilders during the first six months of 1994 rose to 5.2m gross registered tonnes ( grt ) , a level attained for the first time in four years , Reuter reports from Tokyo . 'The major reason was the mass order of nine very large crude carriers ( VLCC ) in that half of the year , ' a spokesman for the Japan Ship Exporters' Association said . A large part of those orders was for the Saudi Arabian National Shipping company 's orders for five double-hulled VLCCs , signed with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries . The last time Japan 's ship orders for a first half were at this level was in 1990 , when 5.5m grt of orders were reported , the association spokesman said . Total orders for all of calendar 1990 stood at 8.6m . However , orders for June were down from May , at 635,586 grt . May registered the largest increase this year when orders peaked at 1,649,910 grt . Japan produces about 40 per cent of the world 's ships and there are virtually no direct subsidies to the Japanese shipbuilding industry . Even so , Japan provides indirect subsidies in the form of loans to shipowners through the Japan Development Bank . In fiscal 1992 , such loans totalled Y53.3bn , according to the transport ministry .
