a fierce battle between rival steam railway companies for control of a 23mile stretch of disused line through snowdonia national park has been decided this week mr john macgregor in one of his last acts as transport secretary gave approval for the ffestiniog railway to acquire the railway bed against a rival claim from the welsh highland light railway in deciding in favour of ffestiniog mr macgregor overturned the recommendation of the inspector who chaired a fourweek public inquiry into the rival bids last year his ruling clears the way for ffestiniog which already runs a successful steam railway over a 13mile route between blaenau ffestiniog and porthmadog to create a 36mile loop through the national park to the tourist centre of caernarfon on the north wales coast mr macgregor came down in favour of ffestiniog in part because of its experience the company which employs 60 people alongside 6000 volunteers expects to invest pounds 350000 in its existing line this year it carries nearly 200000 people a year with a turnover of pounds 2m work on restoring a service on the disused track bed could take up to 15 years to complete and cost between pounds 10m and pounds 15m mr gordon rushton the general manager of the ffestiniog railway is offering the welsh highland light railway an entirely voluntary organisation the chance to cooperate on the project but considerable bitterness remains between the two disputes between rival railway enthusiasts are not uncommon the association of railway preservation societies said it was a pity so much money which could have been spent on restoring the railway had been wasted on legal expenses the decision in favour of ffestiniog could be seen as a further small step down the road towards privatising britains railway network the welsh highland bid had the support of gwynedd county council and a number of other local councils one reason for the inspector recommending welsh highland at the inquiry but mr macgregor concluded that the inspector had attached too little weight to the benefits of placing such matters entirely within the private sector
