equity investors face a hard decision when is the best time to enter the market someone who chose to go in when the market was at its peak in 1987 and the ftsea allshare index stood at 1238 would have had to wait almost four years before the index reached the same level a cannier investor who had realised that the market would overheat that year and waited to go in at the low of 784 in november 1987 would with hindsight have invested at an ideal time almost doubling his money by now but getting market timing right is notoriously difficult one way round the problem is to to use a regular savings scheme to dripfeed money into an investment trust by doing so you avoid buying all your shares at the top of the market and when the market drops you have the consolation of knowing that your money is buying more shares you are protected from the impact of daytoday fluctuations in share prices buying fewer shares when prices are high and more when they are low is known as poundcost averaging because the average purchase price of the shares will be lower than the arithmetic average over the period another attraction of savings schemes is that many providers offer dealing charges as low as 02 per cent or even nil the schemes are flexible in that you can stop them without penalty unlike most insurancerelated products such as endowments although monthly savings schemes are acknowledged as a good thing for smoothing out the peaks and troughs of the market they tend to be used through necessity rather than choice many people find they can only afford to feed pounds 5000 into the market through a pounds 50amonth savings scheme rather than come up with the lump sum however the relatively small minimum investment which many of the schemes allow can obscure the fact that you could be gaining market exposure only very slowly moreover equities have risen over the longterm so despite poundcost averaging you are likely to do better investing a large sum once instead of a much smaller one regularly a crude comparison between a lumpsum investment and regular savings over the longterm shows that returns from the lumpsum investment are almost always higher than those achieved through the savings scheme the comparison is crude because to be fair it is necessary to add to the value of the increasing savingsscheme investment a figure for interest on a diminishing cash sum yet to be invested and which may be waiting on deposit the table below compares the value of investing pounds 100 a month into foreign colonial investment trust over strategic periods the return is compared with the total amount invested over the period invested as a lump investment at the beginning of the period in all cases apart from one the investor would have done better with the lump sum investment the exception occurs during the period september 1987september 1990 before the stock market crash up to the period after the iraqi invasion of kuwait caused world markets to fall this was a turbulent period at the end of which fcs share price was lower than at the beginning monthly savings are not the only option many schemes allow you to invest occasional lump sums usually of a minimum of pounds 250 this allows you to indulge in some markettiming skills but check when the lump sum will be invested some investment trusts take a week or 10 days before buying the shares regular savings or a lumpsum investment amount start date end date pounds regular monthly investment 100 nov 31 1984 nov 31 1987 lump sum invested 3600 regular monthly investment 100 nov 31 1984 sept 30 1987 lump sum invested 3400 regular monthly investment 100 oct 31 1987 aug 31 1990 lump sum invested 3400 regular monthly investment 100 sept 30 1987 sept 30 1990 lump sum invested 3600 regular monthly investment 100 nov 31 1984 mar 30 1994 lump sum invested 11200 lump sum invested 5000 amount value of amount invested investment pounds pounds pounds regular monthly investment 100 3600 3813 lump sum invested 3600 3600 5214 regular monthly investment 100 3400 5831 lump sum invested 3400 3400 7835 regular monthly investment 100 3400 3860 lump sum invested 3400 3400 4899 regular monthly investment 100 3600 3596 lump sum invested 3600 3600 3193 regular monthly investment 100 11200 26682 lump sum invested 11200 11200 54299 lump sum invested 5000 5000 24241 the table shows the value of pounds 100 invested in foreign colonials investment trust over specific periods it also shows the value of the amount invested as a lump sum at the beginning of the period fc savings schemes began in november 1984 post1987 crash precrash gulf crisis iraqi invasion of kuwait in early august led to market falls source foreign colonial
