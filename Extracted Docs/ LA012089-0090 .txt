for the last 14 months don carlos jackson has kept a video camera close at hand as part of a campaign that has made him possibly the most hated cop in squad rooms around los angeles whether driving his corvette through marina del rey on the way home from a date or sitting in a van with friends in watts jackson has been ready to tape fellow police officers in action by his own estimate he has stopped as many as 300 times to watch police as they question others and sometimes he has used himself as bait driving through neighborhoods where he suspects a 30-year-old black man might draw some attention from authorities jackson a hawthorne police sergeant on disability leave calls his patrols a litmus test of how los angeles-area law enforcement agencies treat black people and in most cases he admits the police have passed the test officers have acted with restraint even when he pestered them to justify why they arrested someone or to explain what law empowered them to ask a car's passengers for identification as a result most of his stings were unspectacular and his tapes drew dust on the shelf but this week jackson hit prime time with an nbc television camera capturing the action two long beach police officers stopped him and a friend for allegedly weaving across traffic lanes audiences nationwide watched as jackson got out of the car hesitated before putting his hands over his head and argued with officer mark dickey who then with a stream of obscenities apparently pushed jackson's face into a plate glass window tactics debated the los angeles county district attorney's office and the fbi have begun investigations of the saturday night incident and jackson's tactics have been debated from the opinion pages of newspapers to the los angeles barber shop he uses some have questioned his actions while others have asked who is don jackson and what is he trying to prove jackson said in an interview that he did not welcome the violent confrontation that made him a celebrity but neither was he displeased by the reverberations of the long beach officer's action as i was sitting in the back of the police car he said as much pain as i was in i had a slight smile on my face i said to myself this guy has done all the work for me but in the close-knit fraternity of law enforcement the incident only solidified the feeling of most that jackson is an enemy of the officer on the beat police officials in a number of departments had already cautioned their troops to be on the alert for the off-duty hawthorne sergeant jackson himself said he had heard of his photograph being used as a squad room dart board he's not one of us one hawthorne officer said he's not a cop anymore yet jackson is a man born into the police fraternity and one who knows firsthand what it feels like to have to defend yourself against brutality complaints the son of a career sheriff's deputy his life was built on a bedrock of conformity and assimilation at least until it was remade by the troubling issue of race jackson was bused from los angeles inner city to mostly white birmingham high school in the san fernando valley during the late 1970 s there he followed the advice of his father woodrow who retired in 1984 after 29 years with the sheriff's department and who said he taught his son to prove himself with hard work not with free promotions or affirmative action or anything else popular student elected captain of birmingham's wrestling and football teams don jackson was one of the most popular kids on campus recalled the school's athletic director louis ramirez he was a hard worker who never gave up but jackson said his high school years left him with some bitter memories as well such as the racial taunts of a white student who had a neighboring locker he portrays himself as an intense teen-ager who kept his emotions inside i was completely by myself and that has been consistent in my life he said you can't afford to fight all the time so you just go about your business he added however i always felt it's got to stop somewhere after graduating from california lutheran college jackson joined the ventura county sheriff's department as a deputy in the county jail about 1 1 2 years later in 1982, he was hired by the hawthorne police department some good qualities colleagues who would later criticize his public campaigns admitted that jackson was a good officer one superior capt david barnes described him as an an intelligent articulate good-looking guy but like many law enforcement officers jackson found that the people he dealt with sometimes questioned the force he used court records show that hawthorne was sued in 1982 by a man named gilberto campos who alleged that jackson assaulted him without provocation outside hawthorne community hospital jackson said that he merely defended himself from campos whose elbow was dislocated as he was wrestled to the ground although campos was convicted in inglewood municipal court of battery on a police officer the city eventually agreed to pay him 3,500, hawthorne city atty michael adamson said not the first complaint jackson also acknowledged that he was the target of two minor complaints from prisoners in ventura county jail but said he had never been found guilty of excessive force jackson portrayed such complaints as a price of certain professions doctors lawyers and police officers are all vulnerable to people who believe that their conduct is not proper he said the complaints did not hold back his career he was promoted to sergeant in december 1986 but jackson said his work in hawthorne where 86 of the department's officers are white was marred when some of his colleagues called him and other blacks nigger he said he was also subjected to racist jokes such as the time a white officer waved a white-female doll in his face and said come on jackson i know you want a white woman after two years i said i'm not gaining anything by being quiet he recalled i felt i was less of a man when i was putting up with that all the time when it was totally disrespectful to me other hawthorne officers say that jackson overreacted to minor taunts that once seemed not to bother him relations strained clearly relations were strained and department officials were relieved when he was placed on stress disability in april 1987 jackson also filed a lawsuit still pending accusing the police department of racial discrimination he currently receives 224 a week about one-fourth of his pay when he was on regular duty jackson will not be granted a disability retirement until city officials determine that his stress condition is permanent and stationary said doug gates hawthorne's employee relations officer jackson said he makes due on his scant salary by eating less and living in his father's inglewood condominium his grandmother loaned him 4,000 to buy his video equipment he said jackson said he resolved to begin his public fight because of an incident soon after he left active duty woodrow jackson 61, was driving home from a family gathering when he was stopped by police in pomona the elder jackson subsequently filed a 50,000 claim against that city alleging that without provocation two white officers grabbed him and slammed him to the ground the experience made his very strong father cry jackson said adding for me to see him crying was the ultimate injury pomona officials would not release details of the case but said they expect to reject jackson's claim within the next week formed a group soon after jackson formed law enforcement officers for justice eventually recruiting about 60 other police officers most of them black from around los angeles the group publicly supported complaints of officers and citizens of racism and misconduct in several police departments including those in santa monica and torrance by the end of 1987, jackson was also carting around his video camera looking for evidence he said he went to a series of communities including beverly hills el segundo glendale manhattan beach and torrance to test the response of police in each case officers confronted him without using excessive force he said jackson said he believes most police officers are good guys and they are just trying to do their jobs but you have 10 15 or 20 who are making everybody's life miserable because they are brutalizing people and then making other people react with antagonism toward police he said westwood incident jackson has drawn more than his share of antagonism as well much of it after he drove six black youths to westwood last february and then videotaped los angeles police as they questioned and searched the youths he said the experiment showed that the officers were stopping blacks indiscriminately los angeles police chief daryl f gates in an videotaped speech played at police roll calls soon after said jackson was guilty of a crazy crazy stupid idiotic act you got cops out there who are already stressed out said inglewood police chief ray johnson whose officers got into an argument with jackson when he videotaped them making an arrest they are terrified and now what do they do do they back off or do they continue to do their jobs i think jackson is trying to become a martyr he is going way way beyond what he has to do should be admired but garland hardeman a los angeles policeman who is a friend and adviser to jackson said other officers should admire him what he has done is an obligation that we all should take said hardeman no organization that has the power police do can operate on internal monitoring alone jackson said the nbc producers approached him about demonstrating one of his stings for television leading him to long beach to one of his former hawthorne colleagues who asked to remain anonymous it was a case of jackson using his police experience to push all the right buttons to provoke a confrontation once his car was pulled over he noted that jackson did not remain seated as most motorists would when approached by a policeman jackson admitted that he may have frightened long beach officer dickey but you can't bait a good cop he said i'm giving police what they see all the time both law-abiding black people and non-law-abiding black people and they are not taking the time to discern which is which he dickey went from giving me a command to raise his hands to using maximum force which was more than was necessary jackson said drinking suspected but dickey's attorney michael hannon said jackson was under suspicion of drunk driving because his car was weaving and that dickey used proper police tactics in pushing the uncooperative jackson up against a building the breaking of the window was an unfortunate accident he said jackson has been a busy man in the days since the incident besieged by requests for interviews and feelers from movie producers he said he knows however that agitating other policemen is an avocation that could be dangerous i wake up at night sometimes sweating he said i have a dream that i have been shot or i get hurt but i don't let fear take over he also knows that policemen are not the only people who question what he does when he slipped into a los angeles barber shop this week for a quick trim between television interviews jackson found several black men discussing that hawthorne guy he said the customers did not recognize him as one declared that guy is too damn radical he's running around stirring up trouble all over the place the police are just trying to do their job jackson asked the man if that guy might be trying to point out a pattern of police abuse according to jackson the man bellowed why he ain't got no way of proving that jackson and his father laughed at the story what i'm up against jackson concluded later is that even blacks side with the police there is a presumption that the police are doing their job and you've got to overcome that by giving people clear evidence times staff writers gerald faris david freed jesse katz and chris woodyard also contributed to this article
