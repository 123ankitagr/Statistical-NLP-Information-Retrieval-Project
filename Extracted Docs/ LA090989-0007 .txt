regarding president bushs drug speech first i read in the paper what he was going to say then i heard on the news what he was going to say then i heard on the news what he did say with sound bites what he should or could have said and what it all means if anything then i read in the paper what he did say with verbatim quotes what he should or could have said and what it all means if anything in between there president bush may actually have made a speech though why he would bother is beyond me the speech itself seems to be the least important part of the process no wonder we are losing our ability to make decisions based on our own experience we are being denied the opportunity to have our own experience katharina smith canoga park
