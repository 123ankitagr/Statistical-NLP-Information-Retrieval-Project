Regarding President Bush 's drug speech : First I read in the paper what he was going to say . Then I heard on the news what he was going to say . Then I heard on the news what he did say ( with sound bites ) , what he should or could have said , and what it all means , if anything . Then I read in the paper what he did say ( with verbatim quotes ) , what he should or could have said , and what it all means , if anything . In between there President Bush may actually have made a speech , though why he would bother is beyond me . The speech itself seems to be the least important part of the process . No wonder we are losing our ability to make decisions based on our own experience -- we are being denied the opportunity to have our own experience . KATHARINA SMITH Canoga Park
