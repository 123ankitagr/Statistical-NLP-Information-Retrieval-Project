Rep. Howard L. Berman deserves praise for his part in securing labor leader Jose Mazariego 's release from a Salvadoran treasury police torture chamber ( June 22 ) . It is regrettable that most of the victims in El Salvador lack influential American supporters who can intercede to save them from torture and death . The Times quotes Berman as saying that the new Salvadoran government `` is telling us that labor and other opposition groups will be harassed , that they will be threatened and that their leaders will be cruelly attacked . '' Unfortunately , Berman continues , `` I do n't believe the Kastenmeier Bill ( which calls for an end to American military involvement in El Salvador ) is even within the realm of what anybody is talking about here . '' In blunter language , Berman is telling us that Congress has no intention of ending the U. S. taxpayers ' funding for the crucifixion of El Salvador . WILLIAM H. FORTHMAN Northridge
