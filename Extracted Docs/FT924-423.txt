bill foggitt thirsks 79yearold weather sage is cautious about forecasting a white christmas but thinks it could be a close run thing he is not impressed by the standard criteria for a white christmas by that definition a stray snow flake from siberia could give us a white christmas yet if there is 12 inches of snow on the ground that fell the night before it doesnt count using his own standard of snow on the ground he says the last white christmas was 1981 that followed a severe october just like this year white christmases in 1923 and 1910 did likewise foggitt thinks the snow will be too late for christmas day but forecasts heavy snowfalls later the heron arrived at our local beck much earlier this year which means it will be a hard winter personally i hate the snow
