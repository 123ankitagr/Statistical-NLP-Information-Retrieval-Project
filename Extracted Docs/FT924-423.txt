Bill Foggitt , Thirsk 's 79-year-old weather sage , is cautious about forecasting a white Christmas but thinks it could be a close run thing . He is not impressed by the standard criteria for a white Christmas . 'By that definition a stray snow flake from Siberia could give us a white Christmas yet if there is 12 inches of snow on the ground that fell the night before it does n't count . ' Using his own standard of snow on the ground he says the last white Christmas was 1981 . That followed a severe October just like this year . White Christmases in 1923 and 1910 did likewise . Foggitt thinks the snow will be too late for Christmas Day but forecasts heavy snowfalls later . 'The heron arrived at our local beck much earlier this year which means it will be a hard winter . Personally I hate the snow . '
