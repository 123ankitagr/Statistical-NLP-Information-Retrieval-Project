an ambiguous confession signed by a us army helicopter pilot captured by north korea almost two weeks ago could further complicate efforts to secure his release analysts were divided over whether the statement by chief warrant officer bobby hall would speed his release or provide pyongyang with new grounds to detain him in return for possible concessions from the us if his return is delayed further it is likely to increase prospects that the new republican-controlled us congress will try to block implementation of the recent us nuclear accord with north korea under the accord pyongyang agreed to dismantle its nuclear programme in return for us diplomatic ties and international economic aid mr hall admitted that his oh-58 reconnaissance helicopter made an intrusion deep into north korean airspace adding this criminal action is inexcusable and unpardonable i only hope and it is my desire that the north korean people's army will leniently forgive me for my illegal intrusion so that i may return to my home and be with my family again he concluded the apology may provide a face-saving means for his release while allowing north korea to exploit the incident for propaganda purposes and justify its downing of the helicopter the statement if it was dictated by north korean officials as many believe does not offer much support for pyongyang's allegation that the helicopter was on a spying mission and that its intrusion was deliberate mr hall's statement said that his helicopter deviated from its planned flight route within south korea but gave no explanation for why the helicopter strayed across the demilitarised zone this could imply support for the us claim that the helicopter lost its way after a navigational error but some south korean government analysts believe that mr hall's statement that the helicopter was on an observation reconnaissance mission could be interpreted as espionage if north korea decided to press the affair whether north korea will try to use the issue to gain concessions from the us is still unclear as it negotiates with a senior us diplomat who has travelled to pyongyang to gain the pilot's release north korea may possibly exploit the incident to support its demand that the us sign a formal treaty ending the 1950-53 korean war and begin withdrawing its 37,000 troops from south korea
