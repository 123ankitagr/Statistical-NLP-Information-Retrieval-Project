The woman , whose name was not released pending notification of her next of kin , was airlifted to Long Beach Memorial Hospital and pronounced dead at 6:58 p.m. of massive head injuries , Fire Department spokesman Bob Caldon said . The incident occurred at 6:41 p.m. when the victim , who had just returned from a helicopter ride with her boyfriend and another friend , stepped out of the helicopter and walked behind it into the blades , officials said . `` Sometimes people do n't think and they move real quick , '' Caldon said . `` It was just a very unfortunate situation . '' A helicoptor owned by Life Flight Helicopters , a private firm that airlifts accident victims to hospitals , was refueling at the airport when the accident occurred and immediately flew the woman to the hospital .
