Towles , the Loughborough-based textile maker , has been acquired by London City Equities , the Australian company which was already Towles ' largest shareholder . The purchase became effective following a shareholders meeting of London City in Australia and waiver of final conditions . This brings to an end a three month takeover bid which was initially opposed but ultimately recommended by the Towles board .
