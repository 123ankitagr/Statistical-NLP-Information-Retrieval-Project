the north korean parliament yesterday ratified an agreement with the international atomic energy agency iaea to open the countrys nuclear facilities to inspection but the decision still leaves unclear when inspection will begin south korean officials noted that north korean leader kim ilsung must still formally notify the iaea of the ratification in a written statement once the iaea receives the notice the inspection accord with north korea goes into effect north korea will then have 30 days to submit an inventory report on nuclear materials it possesses and 90 days to disclose construction details of its nuclear facilities this would mean that the iaea inspections will begin in august at the earliest once the north korean information is studied by the iaea according to south korean officials if nuclear reprocessing facilities are found in north korea the agreement betwen the two koreas would require that they be dismantled the us and south korea have been pressing for a june deadline for inspections to begin in the belief that further delays would allow north korea to hide some of its nuclear equipment the two countries claim that north korea could develop a nuclear weapon within a year prosecutors said yesterday they planned to arrest a son of mr chung yujung the founder of hyundai for alleged tax evasion it is the harshest action yet against hyundai since mr chungs new political party won an influencial parliamentary position against the government in last months national assembly elections
