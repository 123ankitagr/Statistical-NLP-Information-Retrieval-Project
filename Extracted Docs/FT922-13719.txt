THE North Korean parliament yesterday ratified an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) to open the country 's nuclear facilities to inspection , but the decision still leaves unclear when inspection will begin . South Korean officials noted that North Korean leader Kim Il-sung must still formally notify the IAEA of the ratification in a written statement . Once the IAEA receives the notice , the inspection accord with North Korea goes into effect . North Korea will then have 30 days to submit an inventory report on nuclear materials it possesses and 90 days to disclose construction details of its nuclear facilities . This would mean that the IAEA inspections will begin in August at the earliest once the North Korean information is studied by the IAEA , according to South Korean officials . If nuclear reprocessing facilities are found in North Korea , the agreement betwen the two Koreas would require that they be dismantled . The US and South Korea have been pressing for a June deadline for inspections to begin in the belief that further delays would allow North Korea to hide some of its nuclear equipment . The two countries claim that North Korea could develop a nuclear weapon within a year . Prosecutors said yesterday they planned to arrest a son of Mr Chung Yu-jung , the founder of Hyundai , for alleged tax evasion . It is the harshest action yet against Hyundai since Mr Chung 's new political party won an influencial parliamentary position against the government in last month 's National Assembly elections .
