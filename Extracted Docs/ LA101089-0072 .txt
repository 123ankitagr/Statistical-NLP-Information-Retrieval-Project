Micropolis Corp. 's `` significantly diminished '' cash levels have led Standard & Poor 's to lower its rating of Micropolis ' convertible subordinated debentures -- a type of debt security -- to triple-C from single-B-minus . Micropolis is a Chatsworth-based maker of computer disk drives that has been struggling for the past year . The upshot of S & P 's action is that , should Micropolis borrow money in the future , it likely would have to pay a higher interest rate to compensate investors for the perceived increased risk of the company 's ability to repay its debts . In announcing the rating cut , S & P noted there `` are no assets to be sold and no operations that could easily be spun off to raise cash , '' and that its new rating assumes `` that alternate sources of liquidity will become available beginning in 1990 .
