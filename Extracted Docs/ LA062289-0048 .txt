A research technician died a week after he contracted a rare form of herpes from a bite or scratch by an infected laboratory monkey . The virus , common and harmless in Old World macaque monkeys , `` is very rare among humans but proves fatal in 70 % of the people who catch it , '' said Dr. William Hall , chief of disease surveillance for the Michigan Department of Public Health . Hall said state health officials are monitoring 21 of the technician 's co-workers at International Research Development Corp. in Mattawan , Mich. , who have been bitten or scratched by the laboratory monkeys . The 23-year-old technician , whose name was withheld at his family 's request , was infected with the `` B '' or `` monkey '' virus while working with Old World macaque monkeys .
