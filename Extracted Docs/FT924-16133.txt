the european commission yesterday adopted a plan for a mutually agreed system of road tax discs for ec lorries regarded as essential for opening up road haulage markets the plan announced by mr karel van miert transport commissioner is likely to win approval from the twelve because individual member states like germany are otherwise expected to go ahead with national road tax systems likely to discriminate against outside hauliers the proposal follows a european court of justice ruling against german plans to introduce unilaterally a road tax payable by foreign lorries a decision is expected before the end of the year on the measure which will come into effect in january 1994 and apply only to motorways and lorries over 12 tonnes the object of the tax is to enable member states to recover infrastructure costs from their road networks and also to make railway transport more attractive but no less important is the now improved prospect of the 12 agreeing to road cabotage allowing hauliers from one member state to pick up and deliver goods inside another member state national restrictions on outside road hauliers mean that up to a fifth of community lorries are driving around empty at any given time the commission is suggesting an ecu929 pounds 725 a year minimum tax per 40 tonnes of lorry as a reference but setting no upper limit the discs should be easily obtainable for variable periods of days weeks and months and imply neither discrimination against outside hauliers nor border checks commission officials said where as in france a toll system operates no change is envisaged officials say governments will be able to reimburse their hauliers for excessive costs incurred abroad apparently at french insistence the commission still hopes to double ec spending on research and development over the next five years in spite of the growing likelihood that member states will rein back the research budget writes andrew hill mr filippo maria pandolfi research commissioner yesterday unveiled plans for a fourth framework programme of research and technological development involving spending ecu147bn pounds 1148bn between 1994 and 1998 the 199094 programme is worth ecu57bn the funds would be concentrated on certain key areas including generic technologies which might benefit all sectors of industry and big science large research programmes like the human genome project the genome is the sum of genetic material in an organism which require multinational collaboration
