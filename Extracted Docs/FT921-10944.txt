Sir , Andrew Lindsay 's estimated cost of a 230-mile round trip ( Letters , January 31 ) may be an improvement on that of Richard Tomkins ( 'When fare is not fair ' , January 29 ) , but it is still not good economics . For example , road tax is a fixed cost and has no bearing on the costs of a journey , which must be variable . He also ascribes the loss in value entirely to use , whereas in the UK a car can lose value merely on account of a change in the letter on its number-plate . In addition , no allowance has been made for repairs as distinct from servicing , not to mention parking ( and/or fines ) . Finally , irrespective of the precise costs involved , there is also the issue of relative convenience , journey time and blood pressure to take into account . Some costs are thus overstated while others are understated , and some not stated at all . Peter Curwen , reader in business policy , Sheffield Business School , Pond Street , Sheffield S1 1WB
