sir andrew lindsays estimated cost of a 230mile round trip letters january 31 may be an improvement on that of richard tomkins when fare is not fair january 29 but it is still not good economics for example road tax is a fixed cost and has no bearing on the costs of a journey which must be variable he also ascribes the loss in value entirely to use whereas in the uk a car can lose value merely on account of a change in the letter on its numberplate in addition no allowance has been made for repairs as distinct from servicing not to mention parking andor fines finally irrespective of the precise costs involved there is also the issue of relative convenience journey time and blood pressure to take into account some costs are thus overstated while others are understated and some not stated at all peter curwen reader in business policy sheffield business school pond street sheffield s1 1wb
