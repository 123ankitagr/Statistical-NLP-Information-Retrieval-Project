If the drought persists through the winter , the city will be forced to buy additional water , Mayor George Maurer said Tuesday . Since June , the city has enacted a voluntary conservation program to reduce water consumption by 10 % . But if the voluntary measures are n't enough , Sierra Madre may adopt a mandatory conservation program by next March , Maurer said . The city offers free water conservation kits and a list of conservation tips for residents at City Hall , 232 W. Sierra Madre Blvd .
