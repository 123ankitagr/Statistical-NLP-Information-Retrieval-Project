the last of the dinosaurs grazed on a primeval grass which has since evolved over 65m years into thousands of different species including the cereal crops which together account for more than half the food eaten by mankind today the different cereals vary enormously in their overall genetic characteristics at one extreme is wheat with a vast amount of genetic material six times more dna than a human being divided between 21 giant chromosomes at the other is rice which has 12 tiny chromosomes and only three per cent as much dna as wheat in between lie maize sorghum and millet research over the past two years has shown however that the genes themselves are remarkably similar in wheat rice and all other cereals and they are arranged in exactly the same sequence in each species in wheat and barley and rye the genes are interspersed with long repetitive stretches of junk dna whereas in rice there is little of this apparently superfluous dna which does not control the plants growth and development this surprising discovery by mike gale graham moore and colleagues at britains john innes centre in norwich working with the japanese rice genome research programme has huge implications for cereal breeding it means that breeders who have traditionally studied each species separately can pool information and quickly come up with a common genetic map that applies to all grasses and cereals once genes for important characteristics for example those conferring resistance to heat or cold disease or drought are identified in one cereal they can be inserted into another using the rapidly developing technology of genetic engineering rice will become the main focus of genetic research in cereals because its genome is so much smaller and therefore easier to manipulate than the other species genome is a useful technical term meaning all the genetic material in a species including the functioning genes control regions that switch them on and off and all the junk dna in between rice can be used as a general tool to isolate genes from any cereal crop we will be using rice as a bridge for research on wheat says dick flavell director of the john innes centre if i had stood up a few years ago as head of a british research institute and said we needed to invest in rice research people would have thought i was bonkers but we do need to the latest developments are good news for japan which had already decided to focus its agricultural genetics research on rice the governmentfunded rice genome research programme is now half way through the task of discovering the precise chemical sequence of the estimated 30000 rice genes fortunately for the rest of the world the japanese seem to be publishing their results quickly and openly rather than restricting access or patenting them at the same time plant scientists worldwide are making rapid progress in developing the genetic engineering technology that will be required to make practical use of the newly discovered genes the 1980s was a frustrating decade because the technique used to transfer genes to other plants infecting them with bacteria which carried in the new dna did not work in cereals but it has turned out during the 1990s that a brutally direct way of inserting genes coating thousands of microscopic gold balls with dna and firing them into plant cells is highly effective and earlier this year zeneca the british bioscience and seeds company announced success with an extraordinarily simple method the researcher shakes a testtube full of water plant cells dna and tiny crystals of a common chemical called silicon carbide the crystals known as whiskers punch holes in the cells through which foreign dna can enter the first field trials of genetically engineered wheat maize and other cereals are getting under way easily traced marker genes have been added to these plants they do not confer commercially valuable characteristics but are used for scientific analysis in cambridgeshire for example ciba seeds is growing two types of wheat this summer one has a red pigment gene taken from wild peruvian maize and the other produces a bacterial enzyme that can be detected in simple tests in the laboratory meanwhile researchers are beginning experiments to transfer genes that would be industrially useful the institute of arable crops research in the uk has a project for instance to give wheat more genes for gluten proteins to enhance its breadmaking properties another early target might be the genes that control the movement of nitrate across cell membranes their enhancement could help wheat to use nutrients more efficiently if so farmers could cut the amount of nitrate fertilisers spread on their fields in the longer run there is potentially huge scope for genetic engineering of all cereals to make them more resistant to attack by pests and diseases and to withstand adverse weather but as paul lazzeri of the iacrs rothamsted experimental station points out in parallel with the research we have to resolve the question of the public acceptance of genetic engineering of food scientists believe that the world will have to accept genetically engineered cereals on current projections twice as much wheat and rice will have to be produced during the next 50 years as in the past 10000 although improved agronomy can make a contribution the only real hope for feeding the growing human population without catastrophic environmental damage lies in applying cereal genetics
