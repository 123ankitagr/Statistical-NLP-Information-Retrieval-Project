john ratliff who heads european marketing for the world's biggest computer disaster recovery company comdisco disaster recovery services of the us says he is anxious not to sound like an ambulance chaser but he accepts that the british mainland bombing campaign by the ira has given a new fillip to the business of computer disaster recovery in which cdrs's uk subsidiary failsafe roc is a market leader last month's announcement by uk insurers that they will withdraw cover for terrorism from conventional insurance policies beginning next year has spurred interest in a product which was already attracting growing interest as people are forced to review their insurance arrangements they are becoming aware that the next best thing is contingency planning says charles shaw director of consultancy at safetynet another market leader services offered by disaster recovery companies range from the provision of alternative customised office space to parallel computer facilities which automatically duplicate every detail entered in a company's day-to-day operations producing an immediate up-to-date copy of all transactions and comprehensive disaster recovery plans the uk market for such services is growing at between 25 to 30 per cent each year according to industry estimates datanews a public relations agency which specialises in the it field says around a dozen companies including failsafe roc safetynet ibm datashield and computer disaster recovery are now competing in a market worth up to pounds 150 m a year in fee income failsafe roc specialises in providing services to users of ibm mainframe computers and has 700 clients in the uk safetynet has 350 clients including 120 financial institutions and specialises in mid-range ibm as 400 computers underpinning the growth is the increasing dependence by nearly all of the financial services sector and increasing numbers of manufacturing companies on computers and electronic flows of information banks and insurance companies for example need to maintain electronic fund transfer or claims payment systems while many manufacturers and retailers are reliant on techniques such as just-in-time warehousing in order to reduce the cost of holding stocks of raw materials or products frequently relatively small accidents a labourer accidentally cutting fibre optic cable for example can lead to big losses of information and money and potentially the business itself if you're in the finance industry every minute down can mean several millions of pounds lost if denied use of computer systems the clock starts ticking and the bank loses three days business it will never get back says ratliff people have this wonderful misconception of what a disaster is they think it is a flood or a fire actually it is when you can't use a computer and the most common reason is hardware failure says colin appleby industry analyst with datanews at the same time demand for disaster recovery services is growing because companies are taking a more sophisticated view of how to manage the day-to-day risks of conducting their businesses already many bigger companies now invest in risk prevention buying fail-safe mechanisms for electronic equipment or installing sprinklers in warehouses for example as well as buying conventional insurance in the same way many risk managers now prepare contingency plans which spell out what senior managers must do when a disaster does occur awareness is so much higher than it has ever been before five years ago people would say i've got insurance now they realise that insurance is not going to look after everything says shaw if you are a bank and you take a hit that makes your facilities inoperable says ratliff all the insurance payments in the world won't necessarily save you money ironically many of the companies affected by the ira bomb in the city of london last april successfully implemented disaster recovery plans reducing losses due to computer damage even so most of the estimated pounds 750 m in claims stems from loss of income rather than from damage to property so the explosions served to demonstrate the potential scale of business interruption losses john athawes marketing development manager for commercial union risk management which offers disaster recovery services says his company is receiving serious inquiries at the rate of 10 per week over the past few months major organisations particularly banks and building societies are taking this very seriously says athawes a conference which focused on commercial union's own highly successful disaster recovery which was brought into play when its own offices were destroyed by the april bomb attracted 300 delegates peter sommer of computer consultancy virtual city associates says that even if insurers are persuaded to offer cover for business interruption or losses caused by terrorists they are likely to insist that policyholders have disaster recovery plans in place you have to place these things together no one will offer cover for business interruption or consequential loss if they don't understand the steps the policyholder will take to recover from a loss he says
