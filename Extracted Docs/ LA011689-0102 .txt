Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker moved their television show to a new time slot today -- the same time their old PTL show runs -- because their previous , earlier hour made it impossible for Tammy 's voice to hit high notes . The `` Jim and Tammy Show '' returned to the airwaves two weeks ago at 9 a.m . But today , it was filmed from their home at 11 a.m. Tammy Faye had told viewers for the last two weeks that her diaphragm did not expand the way it should early in the morning , making it difficult to inhale enough air to hit the high notes .
