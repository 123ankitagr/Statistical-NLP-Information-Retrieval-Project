Stanford University has scored a recruiting coup by receiving a verbal commitment from the nation 's highest-rated high school offensive lineman , according to reports published today . Bob Whitfield , a 6-foot , 7-inch , 275-pound tackle from Banning High School in Wilmington , notified Stanford of his decision on Tuesday , the San Francisco Chronicle and San Francisco Examiner reported . Stanford spokesman Bob Vazquez said today he could not comment on the reports until national letter-of-intent day next Wednesday . But Allen Wallace of SuperPrep magazine in Orange County , which rated Whitfield No . 1 among offensive linemen , called it `` the recruiting coup of the country . '' `` For Stanford to turn the corner , they had to get a player like this , '' Wallace said . The Cardinal finished 3-6-2 last season . Whitfield reportedly chose Stanford over Michigan , Notre Dame , Alabama , Georgia and Miami ( Fla. ) and was influenced strongly by the school 's Jan. 3 hiring of Dennis Green as head coach to replace Jack Elway .
