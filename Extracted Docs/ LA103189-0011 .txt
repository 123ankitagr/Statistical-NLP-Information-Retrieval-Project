after years of debating what kind of art belongs alongside san diego bay louis wolfsheimer wonders if the answer might be right under the port commissioners seven noses wolfsheimer the san diego unified port district board chairman isnt sure how to put a price on the two volkswagensized boulders that were recently extracted from the damaged hull of the exxon valdez but pound for pound or ton for ton he said monday the district would likely pay exxon shipping co a tidy sum for the chance to make one of the rocks into what he calls an environmental monument every time our people come up with a piece of art the commission says its too avantgarde wolfsheimer said noting that the district has more than $ 15 million set aside for public art expenditures but has rejected most proposals i think a boulder in its natural state might work even with a little oil on it wolfsheimers whimsical proposal would secure a final resting place for one of the rocks which became embedded in the valdezs steel hull march 24 when the ship ran aground off alaska but exxon shipping co officials who are facing extensive litigation over the largest oil spill in us history say they arent selling as far as i know its not for sale said les rogers an exxon shipping co spokesman who said he knew of no plans to put either the 6ton or the 10ton boulder on display i wouldnt see any particular advantage to the company in doing that exxon intends to maintain possession until litigation is over years down the road then who knows exxons resistance to making the boulders available is consistent with the port districts foiled attempts to buy public art last year the port districts arts advisory committee a sixmember blueribbon panel resigned en masse their gripe in four years the advisory committee had recommended three artworks all of which the port commissioners either rejected or revised so drastically that the artist withdrew in the meantime the port district accepted two sculptures without its art committees help hugh davis director of the la jolla museum of contemporary art and a former member of the arts committee called one of the pieces a bronze casting of charles lindbergh a gratuitous piece of kitsch by offering to mount the boulder on a pedestal wolfsheimer said he meant no affront to the art world and to environmentalists like rick nadeau of greenpeace action who said he chafes at the idea of turning the exxon valdez into a tourist attraction wolfsheimer responded it was supposed to be fun educational historical a way to remind people what can happen when youre not careful for his part wolfsheimer questioned how exxon can claim ownership of what he calls the most famous boulders in the last century which are being stored in locked steel boxes at the national steel shipbuilding co where the valdez was built and now is being repaired i cant imagine how they own it he said the exxon valdez was built in san diego it is being repaired in san diego theres a great connection between san diego and the ship if we dont get the boulder it should be placed in alaska where the valdez picked it up wolfsheimer imagines that if the port district paid say $ 50000 for a massive piece of history the money could go toward cleanup of the spill but if exxon wont part with it he said hes not going to fight this isnt my lifes work he said theres a lot of things we have to accomplish at the port and one of them is not suing exxon
