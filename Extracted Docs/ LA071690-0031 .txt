The Ventura City Council will consider tonight whether to ban drinking in three downtown parks . The request to ban alcohol use in the Downtown Mini-Park , Valdez Alley and Eastwood Park came last week from the Ventura Parks and Recreation Commission , said Bill Byrets , recreation superintendent for the city . `` We 've had a number of complaints from tourists , downtown businesses and residents who say they are tired of being assaulted by a bunch of drunks , '' Byrets said . `` It 's reached a point where people are reluctant to come downtown because of a small group of transients that basically hang around and drink all day . '' Posting no-drinking signs in the three parks would allow police to enforce laws against drinking in public , Byrets said . Although police patrol the area frequently , alcohol-related problems continue , he said . Currently , a drinking ban is enforced at only two of the city 's 23 parks , Byrets said . Alcohol is banned at Surfers Point and after sunset at Grant Park . Valdez Alley , which connects Main Street with Cedar Street , and Eastwood Park , located at Cedar and Poli streets , pose particular problems because they are isolated . The Downtown Mini-Park , off Main Street , is more accessible , but the presence of drunks scares many people away from the business district , Byrets said . Groups are able to get permits to drink in those parks during special occasions , Byrets said . CAROLYN KUSKY
