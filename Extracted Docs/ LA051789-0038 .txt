Mercury Savings & Loan : The Huntington Beach-based institution , restating its 1988 financial results for a second time , said it lost $ 13.8 million last year . That was nearly double the 1988 loss that it reported two months ago , and a nearly $ 20-million reversal from the profit it originally announced . Regulators earlier this year forced Mercury to reduce the stated value of some of its assets . Mercury Chairman Leonard Shane said the latest revision was made because of incorrect accounting assumptions about the reporting of profits on the sale of loans . In addition , assumptions used to figure Mercury 's tax liability were incorrect , Shane said . For 1987 , Mercury posted earnings of $ 5.1 million . The company also reported a loss for the first quarter of 1989 of $ 700,000 , contrasted with profit of $ 1.1 million for the year-earlier period . Revenue for the quarter increased 8 % to $ 61.6 million .
