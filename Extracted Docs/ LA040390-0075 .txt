U.S. health officials said Monday that they have decertified National Cancer Screening Laboratories -- a Fullerton medical lab that has done work for some Planned Parenthood chapters around the United States -- for allegedly misdiagnosing Pap smear samples . The Health Care Financing Administration informed National Cancer in a letter dated March 30 that Medicare and Medi-Cal programs would no longer pay for Pap smears done at the firm , which shut down operations last week . Harry Barba , HCFA 's associate regional administrator in San Francisco , said the number of alleged misdiagnoses at National Cancer was unacceptable by federal quality control standards . He refused to release specifics until the lab has an opportunity to study the government 's findings but said the percentage of misdiagnoses is `` a substantial number . '' The Pap smear is a medical test regularly used by doctors to detect cervical cancer . National Cancer owner Neil Gregory said he stands behind the quality of the Pap smears analyzed by his firm `` 100 % '' and accused federal and state officials of harassment . `` There is a lot of politics involved in this , '' Gregory said . `` It 's a witch hunt . '' Gregory said he closed National Cancer last week because the company was no longer profitable . `` Over the last 10 months , we 've been winding down the business , '' Gregory said . `` The business is very , very competitive and the profit margins are very narrow . '' National Cancer is the second Pap smear lab in California to be decertified by U.S. officials . Central Pathology Medical Service in Tarzana , the nation 's largest Pap smear lab , lost Medicare and Medi-Cal funding early last year and was shut down by the state . Under a law effective Jan. 1 , the state Department of Health Services will be required to suspend National Cancer 's medical license .
