LLOYD 'S yesterday said its liability over the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster amounted to Dollars 289m ( Pounds 191.3m ) compared with the Dollars 1.2bn total claim lodged in Texas courts by Exxon . It said there was a limit of Dollars 850m on the policy , of which it would be liable for Dollars 289m . Exxon has filed claims against insurers , saying the company 's policies included oil spills and other catastrophes . The underwriters say the agreements excluded marine pollution protection for tankers , and that Exxon as the cargo owner was not legally required to clean up the spill . The Exxon Valdez spilled some 11m gallons of crude oil off Alaska .
