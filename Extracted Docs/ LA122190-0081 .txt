for ventura county retailers a lessthanglittering christmas season is finally drawing to a close although the countys store executives say their holiday business hasnt been a bell ringer most agree that it hasnt been a disaster either some managers are holding out hope for a rush of lastminute buying this weekend to raise sales nearer last years levels christmas 1990 many county retailers say was the season when customers walked past bigticket items such as refrigerators sofas and stoves looking instead for markdowns on toys and sweaters people would come in find an item they liked and say well wait for it to go on sale said don facciano manager of sears roebucks oxnard store all in all facciano said the season that was good but not up to our expectations like most retailers he declined to disclose figures the retail environment is the most competitive ive ever seen he added although sears offered deep discounts and socalled zero financing on some of its higherpriced merchandise customers tended to ignore many of these deals buying sharply reduced clothing and jewelry instead he said on the other hand home electronics such as tvs and video recorders have sold well he said at the toys r us store in ventura store director jeff ferreira said consumers are definitely priceconscious they know how much they want to spend and mostly theyre sticking to it ferreira said toys r us has been most successful with such sale items as nintendo games selling for $ 1998 instead of the usual $ 35 to $ 50 and weve sold hundreds of super fast machines a racing car set that originally listed at $ 6999 he said the current price $ 998 even with these promotions sales are a little below last year ferreira said activity at the jc penney store in ventura started to pick up last weekend but the previous month was disappointing said store manager jim word people finally decided to buy last weekend he said maybe its the cooler weather weve been having that puts people in a holiday frame of mind sales of jackets and sweaters improved at penney as soon as temperatures dropped word said he said womens clothing is doing particularly well and menswear is starting to come back but that jewelry is a little weaker than expected he also reported what he called a surprising demand for mens shorts and other warmweather clothing i suspect people are buying them as gifts for our forces in the persian gulf compared to the 1989 christmas season well probably come out about even this year such lackluster results meaning sales failed to keep up with inflation would be in line with many retail analysts predictions in the oaks mall in thousand oaks dave geiger manager of ritz camera said business this season is running about 10 to 15 below last years pace mediumpriced cameras ranging from about $ 150 to $ 450 are doing nicely he said but more expensive items such as video cameras are not moving as well as last year sales of the camcorders which cost about $ 800 to $ 1200 are off about 30 geiger said adding but i still feel business has been better than some economists predicted i feel well come out quite well if not as strong as last year consumers widespread concern about prices appears to have benefited the countys discount stores were doing very well better than last year said jeff bick manager of the k mart store in camarillo still he said shoppers this year are spending more on basic items rather than the seasonal gifty stuff items that are moving especially well bick said include toys clothing tvs and toaster ovens nintendo games are doing fairly well but compact disc players are not real hot he said people are very valueconscious theyre waiting for sale items markdowns are very important to them steve hoxmeier manager of the target discount store in simi valley said sales are comparable with last year despite defenseindustry layoffs that have affected some residents im happy he said people are in a good mood weve had no decrease from last christmas possibly because were a discount store and customers are extremely priceconscious turtleneck sweaters exercise outfits and a computer toy called game boy that sells for $ 8999 have been moving especially well hoxmeier said unlike k marts bick he reported strong sales of compact disc players theyre having their first big year he said another retailer reporting christmas business

venturas buenaventura mall judys which sells mediumpriced dresses and ghq which features menswear said volume is down a few percentage points at both weve been reducing some prices at judys by a third and that helps she said she added that some shoppers may have avoided the mall because they didnt realize that a longstanding renovation project there has been halted until after the holidays at the oaks mall gabrielle smith manager of the lanz of california womens wear store said its been pretty slow weve been successful in moving some dresses that were reduced from $ 180 to $ 109 but were definitely below last year and vikki coronado district manager of wet seal a group of stores that sell young womens sportswear said sales at the chains units in both thousand oaks and oxnard are a little below last year but she added were doing fair in view of the economy which has hit everybody sears facciano suggested one bright spot that may help retailers this holiday season the calendar
