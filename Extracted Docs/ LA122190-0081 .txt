For Ventura County retailers , a less-than-glittering Christmas season is finally drawing to a close . Although the county 's store executives say their holiday business has n't been a bell ringer , most agree that it has n't been a disaster , either . Some managers are holding out hope for a rush of last-minute buying this weekend to raise sales nearer last year 's levels . Christmas 1990 , many county retailers say , was the season when customers walked past big-ticket items such as refrigerators , sofas and stoves , looking instead for markdowns on toys and sweaters . `` People would come in , find an item they liked and say , 'We 'll wait for it to go on sale , ' `` said Don Facciano , manager of Sears Roebuck 's Oxnard store . All in all , Facciano said , the season that `` was good , but not up to our expectations . '' Like most retailers , he declined to disclose figures . `` The retail environment is the most competitive I 've ever seen , '' he added . Although Sears offered deep discounts and so-called zero financing on some of its higher-priced merchandise , customers tended to ignore many of these deals , buying sharply reduced clothing and jewelry instead , he said . On the other hand , home electronics , such as TVs and video recorders , have sold well , he said . At the Toys R Us store in Ventura , store director Jeff Ferreira said , `` Consumers are definitely price-conscious . They know how much they want to spend and mostly they 're sticking to it . '' Ferreira said Toys R Us has been most successful with such sale items as Nintendo games selling for $ 19.98 instead of the usual $ 35 to $ 50 . `` And we 've sold hundreds of Super Fast Machines , a racing car set that originally listed at $ 69.99 , '' he said . The current price : $ 9.98 . Even with these promotions , sales are `` a little below last year , '' Ferreira said . Activity at the JC Penney store in Ventura started to pick up last weekend , `` but the previous month was disappointing , '' said store Manager Jim Word . `` People finally decided to buy last weekend , '' he said . `` Maybe it 's the cooler weather we 've been having . That puts people in a holiday frame of mind . '' Sales of jackets and sweaters improved at Penney as soon as temperatures dropped , Word said . He said women 's clothing is doing particularly well and menswear is `` starting to come back , '' but that jewelry is `` a little weaker than expected . '' He also reported what he called a surprising demand for men 's shorts and other warm-weather clothing . `` I suspect people are buying them as gifts for our forces in the Persian Gulf . '' Compared to the 1989 Christmas season , `` we 'll probably come out about even this year . '' Such lackluster results -- meaning sales failed to keep up with inflation -- would be in line with many retail analysts ' predictions . In The Oaks Mall in Thousand Oaks , Dave Geiger , manager of Ritz Camera , said business this season is running about 10 % to 15 % below last year 's pace . `` Medium-priced cameras , ranging from about $ 150 to $ 450 , are doing nicely , '' he said , `` but more expensive items , such as video cameras , are not moving as well as last year . '' Sales of the camcorders , which cost about $ 800 to $ 1,200 , are off about 30 % , Geiger said , adding : '' But I still feel business has been better than some economists predicted . I feel we 'll come out quite well , if not as strong as last year . '' Consumers ' widespread concern about prices appears to have benefited the county 's discount stores . `` We 're doing very well -- better than last year , '' said Jeff Bick , manager of the K mart store in Camarillo . Still , he said shoppers this year `` are spending more on basic items rather than the seasonal , gifty stuff . '' Items that are moving especially well , Bick said , include toys , clothing , TVs and toaster ovens . `` Nintendo games are doing fairly well , but compact disc players are not real hot , '' he said . `` People are very value-conscious . They 're waiting for sale items . Markdowns are very important to them . '' Steve Hoxmeier , manager of the Target discount store in Simi Valley , said sales are `` comparable with last year '' despite defense-industry layoffs that have affected some residents . `` I 'm happy , '' he said . `` People are in a good mood . We 've had no decrease from last Christmas , possibly because we 're a discount store and customers are extremely price-conscious . '' Turtleneck sweaters , exercise outfits and a computer toy called Game Boy that sells for $ 89.99 have been moving especially well , Hoxmeier said . Unlike K mart 's Bick , he reported strong sales of compact disc players . `` They 're having their first big year , '' he said . Another retailer reporting Christmas business about even with last year 's pace was Joe Raabe , manager of the Mervyn 's store in Oxnard . `` So far we 're very pleased , but . . . .the retail environment is very tough this year . '' Lisa King , manager of two stores in Ventura 's Buenaventura Mall -- Judy 's , which sells medium-priced dresses , and GHQ , which features menswear -- said volume is down a few percentage points at both . `` We 've been reducing some prices at Judy 's by a third , and that helps , '' she said . She added that some shoppers may have avoided the mall because they did n't realize that a longstanding renovation project there has been halted until after the holidays . At The Oaks Mall , Gabrielle Smith , manager of the Lanz of California women 's wear store , said , `` It 's been pretty slow . We 've been successful in moving some dresses that were reduced from $ 180 to $ 109 , but we 're definitely below last year . '' And Vikki Coronado , district manager of Wet Seal , a group of stores that sell young women 's sportswear , said sales at the chain 's units in both Thousand Oaks and Oxnard are `` a little below last year . '' But , she added : `` We 're doing fair in view of the economy , which has hit everybody . '' Sears ' Facciano suggested one bright spot that may help retailers this holiday season : the calendar . `` Christmas falls on a Tuesday this year , '' he said . `` That means we 'll have what amounts to a three-day weekend for last-minute shopping . We 're hoping for a dynamite final weekend . '' * LAST CHANCE : Merchants hold out hope for a three-day sales blitz . D1
