i aint gon na play sun city artists united against apartheid 1985 i aint gon na play sun city or phoenix or tempe or tucson football united against arizona 1990 america in the 1990s is a country infatuated with symbols where the burning of a flag can inflame the public fervor but the plight of the homeless cant where just say no buttons are considered the solution to the drug problem where one glib catchphrase about reading lips can decide a presidential election and where arizona can be branded the new pretoria because its voters rejected a martin luther king jr holiday thats the thing about symbols theyre simple theyre not messy they make us feel better about ourselves because they enable us to take a stand without getting sweaty or dirty or personally involved this is why the nfl decides to fight racism by threatening to pull the 1993 super bowl out of phoenix and not addressing the issue of why the league has but one black head coach and no black general managers this is why college football jumps on the same bandwagon by threatening to move the fiesta bowl from tempe and castigating teams for accepting bids to tucsons copper bowl but shrugs its shoulders at a system that exploits black athletes for millions of entertainment dollars only to shove them out four years later without degrees or worse as functional illiterates of course it is an embarrassment that arizona voted against a martin luther king holiday it is also an embarrassment that two other states montana and new hampshire fail to observe the same holiday but why make it an issue now arizona has been without a martin luther king holiday since 1987 why was there no outcry when the nfl first awarded the super bowl to phoenix why was there no protest when bill bidwill decided to move his cardinals from st louis to phoenix why were there no condemnations when notre dame and west virginia chose the fiesta bowl for their national championship showdown and if arizona is to be blacklisted as a racist state what is bigtime sports going to do about the rest of the country what about san diego where voters refused to rename market street as martin luther king jr way where the board of port commissioners refused to name the new convention center after king what about new orleans where the 1990 super bowl was staged despite the fact that david duke a former ku klux klan member was holding a public office in the state of louisiana what about miami where the 1989 super bowl was staged while race riots raged in the streets what about charlotte home to the nba hornets and the type of sentiment that can reelect sen jesse helms the old segregationist who based his recent campaign on an antiaffirmative action platform what about birmingham where some of this nations bloodiest racial skirmishes were fought and where the allamerican bowl is still played what about washington dc where the nfl team that plays in the nations capital is known as the redskins what about cleveland which has a baseball team known as the indians what about boston home to the whitest baseball team in the land here is where the best black player in the history of the franchise jim rice retires and the red sox honor him by having rice share his day with bob stanley who was nothing more than an average white relief pitcher and what about the frightening kind of al campanis thought that still permeates much of majorleague baseball in the dugouts and the press boxes of the american league you hear it whispered that the reason the toronto blue jays dont win is because they have too many dominicans replete with all the hoary stereotypes theyre too hotheaded they dont play together they fold under pressure too often these whispers are acknowledged only by a nod the problem with bigtime sports entering the political arena on one issue is that it leaves itself open to hypocrisy on so many others racism in sports as in society begins at home and neither the nfl nor the ncaa has its own house entirely in order no doubt racism figured in the defeat of the arizona king day but the outcome is clouded by a variety of outside factors including the nfl itself a week before the election it was leaked or planted that the nfl would consider pulling the super bowl if arizona rejected the king measure previously several polls had indicated that voters would pass the initiative by a 10 to 15point margin but many perceived the leakplant as blackmail dug in their heels and voted no simply over principle the nfl made itself an issue when the only one that should have mattered was the proper honoring of a great civil rights leader after the fact it is too easy to grandstand it is difficult to look bad by taking the antiarizona stand on this one the nfl and the ncaa can do much better much more how about some affirmative action inside nfl front offices and within nfl coaching staffs what about taking ncaa television money and using it to increase educational opportunities for minorities ironically the fiesta bowl stands to do more real good by staying and playing than symbolically pulling out the bowl is planning to pay each team an additional $ 100000 to be earmarked for minority scholarship programs that isnt as dramatic as moving the bowl to another state only more constructive
