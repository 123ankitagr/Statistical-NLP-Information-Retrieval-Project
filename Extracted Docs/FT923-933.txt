Sir , I realise that headlines are meant to be terse and to the point , but a little punctuation would occasionally help . On the front page of your international edition ( September 23 ) I wondered whether 'Maastricht lives on promises Kohl ' was intended as 'Maastricht lives on , promises Kohl ' or 'Maastricht lives on promises : Kohl ' . However , a few more minutes ' thought persuaded me that in this case it probably didn't matter . . . Ian Duncalf , Up de Schanz 70 , 2000 Hamburg 52 , Germany
