philadelphia 12 jonathan demme kafka 15 steven soderbergh cool runnings pgjohn turteltaub the pelican brief 12 alan j pakula is it good to be gay for britain the sight of hollywood and the house of commons jumping on the same bandwagon in the same week must be the most startling andor stirring of modern times westminster gives us a new age of consent tinseltown with philadelphia gives us a new age of moviegoing awareness and even uncle oscar has clambered on the zeitgeist with a best actor nomination for the films star tom hanks hanks has this writers vote his believability as an aidsravaged jobdismissed lawyer gives shape and measure to the films at times floodlevel sentimentalism the first mainstream us movie ever to tackle aids philadelphia is directed by jonathan demme as if he had been abducted by gay lib and forced to make amends for his silence of the lambs you recall that brouhaha film pilloried by agitgays right up to oscar time for its picture of a seemingly homosexual serial killer philadelphia takes a lawyer and crosses out seemingly hankss face already shows the telltale blots of kaposis sarcoma when a job superior asks whats that on your forehead pal hanks mutters something about squash balls but we know better he is losing weight his gay friends are offering makeup tips tahitian bronze to hide the lesions and the film is offering captions like nine days later to stress that this is ticking timebomb territory where love and illness meet in a countdown to apocalypse while half our brain hardens itself to the threat of hyperbole the other half senses something wonderful here ron nyswaners script plots the film as a legal suspense story using courtroom scenes to resolve hankss unfairdismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the payroll and torn up partnership promises this is just the populist approach what filmgoer resists a trial to capture all those gayrightsresistant audiences in americas bible belts or britains own bigotry zones hankss costar denzel washington adds another twist to the plot he is the radical black lawyer who agrees to be hankss legal galahad even though the one flaw in mr ws liberalism is a tendency to homophobia while we are turning to mush during hankss big selfrevelation scene a surreallylit fantasia in which our tearful hero expounds the maria callas aria keening from his cdplayer while he dances with his dripfeed stand dw looks on with a blend of cautious scepticism and heterosexual high anxiety by the films final fade of course he has resolved his problems and become as mushy as the rest of us to have made this character a black was a touch of genius it means that mr and mrs intolerant filmgoer if they want to make an antigay alliance with one of the films characters must do so with a member of another minority they might not be on kissing terms with only alternative to side with the bigwig bigots jason robards and co who spend the movies second half pinned to their attorneys table while the camera frisks them for guilty reaction shots philadelphia knows every trick and plays it but it will still send all but the stoniest cineastes sniffling from the theatre its heart is in the right place and whatever else may be sorcery or special pleading hanks is the real thing no sentimental martyr but a messy plausible collage of rage bewilderment selfpity resignation and gallows humour that puckered baby face that elastic voice with the builtin shrugs preside over a convincingly wasted body one from which hanks shed 30 pounds for filming in actings most heroic dietary crashcourse since de niro went the other way in raging bull philadelphia comes with a big bold bellsandwhistles subject ah an aids movie everyone can say it but what is kafka the second film from director steven sex lies and videotape soderbergh about limping into london two years after it was made this praguefilmed fantasy about franz k jeremy irons and the gothic adventures he might have had if he had been a fictional character chasing murderers mutants and mad doctors is like two hours on a freeassociation couch in the k section of the great literature library screenwriter lem dobbs must have said kafka to himself and then gone berserk at his mental wordprocessor he gives us vast clicketyclick offices a pair of sinister twins theresa russell as one of fks standardissue teasing heroines alec guinness and ian holm as assorted authority figures and a riot of cobbled streets graveyards and beetling castles what we do not have is a plot unless you count the jumble of conspiracy shenanigans that climax somehow in a castle laboratory soderbergh and dobbs may feel they must pay their dues to german expressionism but why should we pay to watch we tire quickly and a perplexedlooking irons looks as if he tired even more quickly of the injoky names murnau orlok and invocations of art goneby other choices this week are the nonpretentious cool runnings and the somnolently zigzagging the pelican brief the first is all about the jamaican bobsled team that made history when they competed at the 1988 calgary winter olympics four sunblack west indians played by actors whose names seem to have fallen off a scrabble board parlay their hometown sprinting and gokart skills into the art of hurtling down snow chutes a film that might have been inspirational proves inspired debut director john turteltaub has a comic timing that hollywood veterans might envy and the script rattles around like a crowded bobsled risking sharp corners boldest touch of all was to cast fat and funny john candy as the teams trainer an exgold medal winner and then to fill him with a sour abrasive worldweary wit worthy of walter matthau a surprise a delight neither of those words suggests itself for the pelican brief you remember the twists and thrills in the john grishambased the firm repeat here with diminished returns julia roberts is the fledgeling lawyer who flies straight into a giant conspiracy beginning with the murder of two supreme court justices and the supporting characters are famous hollywood names pushed unceremoniously into the victim or villain lobby sam shepard john heard robert culp while the plot dashes through every picturesque powercorridor it can find ending up at the white house the only character you believe in is denzel washington as miss jrs newsman friend flying out from philadelphia to sketch in another sharpnosed knight errant as for roberts herself i never felt i was watching a frightened truthseeker more an actress drowning in too much plot alan j pakula who could direct films like this in his sleep all the presidents men the parallax view seems to have done so here finally a brief hatdoffing to the success of these islands at the recent berlin film festival the golden bear for best film placed its paw on in the name of the father the golden bear for best actress hugged crissy rock in ken loachs new ladybird ladybird mr hanks got best actor for philadelphia and loach himself won the international critics prize for his truthbased drama that for all its bureaucracywalloping ott tendencies multiple mother miss rock keeps losing babies to overzealous social workers had more energy than all the other films in berlin put together
