philadelphia 12 jonathan demme kafka 15 steven soderbergh cool runnings pg john turteltaub the pelican brief 12 alan j pakula is it good to be gay for britain the sight of hollywood and the house of commons jumping on the same bandwagon in the same week must be the most startling and or stirring of modern times westminster gives us a new age of consent tinseltown with philadelphia gives us a new age of moviegoing awareness and even uncle oscar has clambered on the zeitgeist with a best actor nomination for the film's star tom hanks hanks has this writer's vote his believability as an aids-ravaged job-dismissed lawyer gives shape and measure to the film's at times flood-level sentimentalism the first mainstream us movie ever to tackle aids philadelphia is directed by jonathan demme as if he had been abducted by gay lib and forced to make amends for his silence of the lambs you recall that brouhaha film pilloried by agit-gays right up to oscar time for its picture of a seemingly homosexual serial killer philadelphia takes a lawyer and crosses out seemingly hanks's face already shows the tell-tale blots of kaposi's sarcoma when a job superior asks what's that on your forehead pal hanks mutters something about squash balls but we know better he is losing weight his gay friends are offering make-up tips tahitian bronze to hide the lesions and the film is offering captions like nine days later to stress that this is ticking time-bomb territory where love and illness meet in a countdown to apocalypse while half our brain hardens itself to the threat of hyperbole the other half senses something wonderful here ron nyswaner's script plots the film as a legal suspense story using courtroom scenes to resolve hanks's unfair-dismissal suit against the firm that has soon pushed him off the payroll and torn up partnership promises this is just the populist approach what filmgoer resists a trial to capture all those gay-rights-resistant audiences in america's bible belts or britain's own bigotry zones hanks's co-star denzel washington adds another twist to the plot he is the radical black lawyer who agrees to be hanks's legal galahad even though the one flaw in mr w's liberalism is a tendency to homophobia while we are turning to mush during hanks's big self-revelation scene a surreally-lit fantasia in which our tearful hero expounds the maria callas aria keening from his cd-player while he dances with his dripfeed stand dw looks on with a blend of cautious scepticism and heterosexual high anxiety by the film's final fade of course he has resolved his problems and become as mushy as the rest of us to have made this character a black was a touch of genius it means that mr and mrs intolerant filmgoer if they want to make an anti-gay alliance with one of the film's characters must do so with a member of another minority they might not be on kissing terms with only alternative to side with the bigwig bigots jason robards and co who spend the movie's second half pinned to their attorney's table while the camera frisks them for guilty reaction shots philadelphia knows every trick and plays it but it will still send all but the stoniest cineastes sniffling from the theatre its heart is in the right place and whatever else may be sorcery or special pleading hanks is the real thing no sentimental martyr but a messy plausible collage of rage bewilderment self-pity resignation and gallows humour that puckered baby face that elastic voice with the built-in shrugs preside over a convincingly wasted body one from which hanks shed 30 pounds for filming in acting's most heroic dietary crash-course since de niro went the other way in raging bull philadelphia comes with a big bold bells-and-whistles subject ah an aids movie everyone can say it but what is kafka the second film from director steven sex lies and videotape soderbergh about limping into london two years after it was made this prague-filmed fantasy about franz k jeremy irons and the gothic adventures he might have had if he had been a fictional character chasing murderers mutants and mad doctors is like two hours on a free-association couch in the k section of the great literature library screenwriter lem dobbs must have said kafka to himself and then gone berserk at his mental word-processor he gives us vast clickety-click offices a pair of sinister twins theresa russell as one of fk's standard-issue teasing heroines alec guinness and ian holm as assorted authority figures and a riot of cobbled streets graveyards and beetling castles what we do not have is a plot unless you count the jumble of conspiracy shenanigans that climax somehow in a castle laboratory soderbergh and dobbs may feel they must pay their dues to german expressionism but why should we pay to watch we tire quickly and a perplexed-looking irons looks as if he tired even more quickly of the in-joky names murnau orlok and invocations of art gone-by other choices this week are the non-pretentious cool runnings and the somnolently zigzagging the pelican brief the first is all about the jamaican bobsled team that made history when they competed at the 1988 calgary winter olympics four sun-black west indians played by actors whose names seem to have fallen off a scrabble board parlay their home-town sprinting and go-kart skills into the art of hurtling down snow chutes a film that might have been inspirational proves inspired debut director john turteltaub has a comic timing that hollywood veterans might envy and the script rattles around like a crowded bobsled risking sharp corners boldest touch of all was to cast fat and funny john candy as the team's trainer an ex-gold medal winner and then to fill him with a sour abrasive worldweary wit worthy of walter matthau a surprise a delight neither of those words suggests itself for the pelican brief you remember the twists and thrills in the john grisham-based the firm repeat here with diminished returns julia roberts is the fledgeling lawyer who flies straight into a giant conspiracy beginning with the murder of two supreme court justices and the supporting characters are famous hollywood names pushed unceremoniously into the victim or villain lobby sam shepard john heard robert culp while the plot dashes through every picturesque power-corridor it can find ending up at the white house the only character you believe in is denzel washington as miss jr's newsman friend flying out from philadelphia to sketch in another sharp-nosed knight errant as for roberts herself i never felt i was watching a frightened truth-seeker more an actress drowning in too much plot alan j pakula who could direct films like this in his sleep all the president's men the parallax view seems to have done so here finally a brief hat-doffing to the success of these islands at the recent berlin film festival the golden bear for best film placed its paw on in the name of the father the golden bear for best actress hugged crissy rock in ken loach's new ladybird ladybird mr hanks got best actor for philadelphia and loach himself won the international critics prize for his truth-based drama that for all its bureaucracy-walloping ott tendencies multiple mother miss rock keeps losing babies to overzealous social workers had more energy than all the other films in berlin put together
