Golfers have a new kind of drive at the Mission Viejo Country Club . The street leading to the country club and golf course has been changed -- from Goleta Drive to Country Club Drive . The public street , south of Oso Parkway between Marguerite Parkway and Interstate 5 , received the new identity by a vote of the City Council . The change was requested by the Mission Viejo Country Club , which will pay $ 107.13 to cover costs .
