THE 60 staff at London 's RiverBus company will be told their fate today . Robson Rhodes , the accountancy firm , was at the company yesterday preparing to take over as liquidators . Mr Michael Davies , business manager , confirmed that services had been terminated and that no purchaser of the business was in prospect . RiverBus , which operated over 10 miles of the Thames between Chelsea , the City , Docklands and Greenwich , ran its last service on Friday . It has been in jeopardy since Olympia & York , the Canary Wharf developer which was its main underwriter , went into receivership 15 months ago .
