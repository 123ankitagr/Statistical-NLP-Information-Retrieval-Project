research studies have shown that up to 75 per cent of all telephone calls initially fail to find the right person one solution to this problem is to install an answering machine or other voice-messaging technology the answering machine is a simple and effective means for passing on information to an individual or a small group of people if they are unavailable at the time of a call the latest models boast sophisticated refinements which for example allow owners to access the machine remotely then by tapping out a code on the telephone keypad go straight to the stored messages other features on new machines like the panasonic kx-t1456 which costs less than pounds 85 and is designed for private or small business use include a message memo facility which enables messages to be left by family or a secretary while the user is away most mobile telephone-users now have access to messaging services for example in the uk cellnet launched its 24-hour answering services for cellphone customers last autumn the system called callback will record all calls automatically and then call the mobile phone user to transmit the messages to use the service the cellnet customer simply taps in a short divert code and from then on all unanswered calls are automatically handled by callback the competing vodafone mobile phone system launched a similar service called recall last month once connected to the service all calls are answered even if the customer's mobile phone is switched off and they are then alerted by a call when they switch back on the recall service also offers a number of other features including a simple help menu for example to repeat or skip messages security code message protection a choice of greeting message for callers more generally voice and call processing technology enables a standard telephone to function as a computer terminal by allowing the user to access computer applications using voice commands the telephone keypad or a combination of the two the european market for voice and call processing systems is projected to grow from pounds 100 m last year to pounds 850 m in 1995 and is being targeted by companies like hampshire-based advanced system architectures which has launched a range of voice and call processing systems and products offered as productivity boosters to businesses and to software houses and systems integrators using the technology voice mail and voice-messaging systems which represent a kind of corporate answering machine where messages are recorded to be picked up by the recipient dialling a personal mailbox number were pioneered in the us by companies like octel at and t vmx northern telecom and centigram although used widely in the us companies in europe have only recently begun using voice messaging technology and implementation of systems in the uk is running about three years behind the us however the uk is generally ahead of the rest of europe probably because it was the first country in europe to liberalise the provision of phone services and equipment as a result the number of touch-tone telephones is quite large in the uk and that is a pre-requisite for voice messaging unless people carry touch-pads around in their pockets the whole time many large companies first begin to use voice-messaging services through a telephone company bureau this enables them to become familiar with the technology by using a small number of voice mail boxes once they appreciate the advantages many install their own equipment which can then handle more complicated processing tasks like combining voice messaging with electronic mail and faxes by providing a link between the company computer system and the in-house voice-processing system electronic mail usually sent from one computer user to another can be stored digitally in the recipient's mailbox a caller interrogating the messaging system will then be told that there are say two voice and one electronic mail messages the caller can then listen to the voice mail messages and if required the electronic mail can also be read to the caller by a digitised computer voice some systems can even go further storing facsimile messages which can then be forwarded to a fax machine near the caller while technologies such as voice mail enables callers to leave retrieve or exchange digitally recorded voice-messages audiotex enables callers to access a wide variety of pre-recorded information for example aircraft flight times most recently interactive voice response products have emerged which allow callers to input information to and retrieve information and services from a company computer database using a touch-tone telephone these different voice processing technologies are gradually merging together and becoming increasingly sophisticated with the use of voice recognition voice synthesis and image processing to handle more complex transactions one example of this was un veiled earlier this year by syntellect an arizona-based company which launched what it claims is the first multilingual interactive voice response system syntellect's new global-series of interactive voice response ivr systems was designed to enable callers from anywhere in the world to call at any time of day or night and to and leave or receive a message place an order obtain a quote or get an answer a technical query using sophisticated voice synthesis and processing techniques the system understands six different languages at first contact level once onto the system the caller can then communicate in any of 26 languages the ivr system can be connected to almost any sort of host computer system allowing the caller to access his target's database either to input information or to retrieve information and services it also allows the caller to leave retrieve or exchange digitally recorded messages or access pre-recorded information using audiotex the system is aimed at organisations like banks and other financial services companies transport companies governments and company sales and customer service departments using systems like this it is claimed that costs can be reduced because there is less need for human telephone switchboard operators and customers benefit from improved 24-hours service like their less-sophisticated counterparts they may also help increase the proportion of calls and messages that do eventually find their way to the intended recipient
