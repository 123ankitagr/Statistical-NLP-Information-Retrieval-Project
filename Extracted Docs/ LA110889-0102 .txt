Talks were said to be continuing between Sony and leaders of the Warner Bros. studio over releasing the two producers , whose credits include `` Batman , '' from an exclusive five-year contract to make movies at Warner . Sony completed its tender offer for Columbia stock last week , and 99.3 % of its stock was tendered under the $ 27-a-share offer .
