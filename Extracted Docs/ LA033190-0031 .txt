What credibility is there in major league baseball ? First , we had the nonsensical delay of games . Then they ca n't figure out how to play 162 games . They could play old-fashioned doubleheaders , but of course , that would be giving the fans two games for the price of one . Do n't want to do that too often , do we ? AL BENSON El Cajon
