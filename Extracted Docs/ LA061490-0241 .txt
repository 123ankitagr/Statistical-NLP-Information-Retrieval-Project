fierce ideological rivals met backstage at `` CBS This Morning '' today and there were neither fireworks nor fisticuffs . Former President Richard M. Nixon and radical lawyer William Kunstler appeared on the show separately , and Kunstler went searching for Nixon , whom he had never met . `` Where is he ? I 've got to find him , '' Kunstler said after he had been part of a discussion about the First Amendment . He finally found Nixon in the makeup room , where he was being prepped for his own interview . Kunstler asked the former President if he really was Richard Nixon and then they shook hands and they chatted briefly but pleasantly . The topics were aging and baseball .
