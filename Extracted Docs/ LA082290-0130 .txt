Richard Miller , the only FBI agent ever charged with espionage , betrayed his country by passing secret documents to his Soviet lover out of lust and `` to make a quick buck , '' a prosecutor said today . `` He did not begin his ( FBI ) career to become a spy . But he did become a spy , '' Assistant U.S. Atty . Adam Schiff said in opening Miller 's third trial on espionage and bribery charges . Miller allegedly delivered an FBI intelligence manual in 1984 to the Soviet emigre with whom he had an adulterous affair and believed was an agent of the Soviet spy agency , the KGB .
