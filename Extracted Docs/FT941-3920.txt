an illstarred issue of gold coins minted to honour former emperor hirohito has turned into a meltdown for the japanese government financially as well as literally the finance ministry stands to lose about y270bn pounds 172bn on the sale of 90 tonnes of gold obtained from melting down the coins which were issued in 1986 and 1987 to commemorate hirohitos 60 years on the throne leading traders say the loss is probably the largest any government has suffered through a gold sale the coins have been dogged by controversy and scandal they were issued with a face value of y100000 each but contained gold worth only half that the government initially seemed to have made a profit of about y500bn but in 1990 tokyo police claimed that counterfeit hirohito coins were being imported into japan the report caused so much uncertainty that many japanese sold their coins back to the bank of japan the melt value of each coin has fallen to about y25000 because the japanese currency has strengthened and the gold price has fallen since they were issued as the bank of japan has had to redeem all returned coins at face value it could lose y75000 a coin the 90 tonnes of coins mentioned by the finance ministry last week is equivalent to about 45m hirohito coins each containing 20 grams of gold according to gold dealers mr paul davies a british coin dealer from whom 3200 allegedly counterfeit coins were confiscated repeated at the weekend his belief that the coins in question were genuine no charges have been brought against him he is pursuing court actions against the japanese authorities seeking the return of the confiscated coins and asking for compensation he expects the case to take another two years the meltdown could affect sentiment in the gold market mr andy smith analyst at the union bank of switzerland said the amount of gold is insignificant and the market will easily absorb it but the symbolism of this is immeasurable in that we have the first gold sale from one of the western worlds principal gold hoarding nations
