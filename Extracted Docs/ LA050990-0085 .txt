Question : I 've been running for several years , and recently I tried running in water , and running in water is much more difficult . Does that mean that you can use up more calories when you run in water ? Can you provide some comparison ? Answer : Running in a pool is estimated to consume about 1,000 calories an hour , compared with about 600 to 700 calories when you run on land .
