CHAUSSON , the French automobile company which is jointly owned by Peugeot and Renault , said yesterday that it was suspending payments . The group , which manufactures parts for France 's two largest automobile groups , said that it was forced into the decision by an increasingly difficult financial situation and the failure of Renault and Peugeot to agree on a restructuring package . Renault and Peugeot both own 48.5 per cent of the company 's shares . Under French company law , Chausson will present its application to suspend payments at a commercial tribunal . An administrator should then be appointed . The company said it will continue its production activities . These include the manufacture of parts for the Renault Trafic , a small van , and for a Peugeot utility vehicle . Until last March it had also produced parts for the Peugeot 205 . Renault said yesterday it had been willing to pay half of a restructuring package , estimated at FFr170m ( Dollars 30m ) for this year , if Peugeot would pay the other half . Peugeot declined to comment yesterday .
