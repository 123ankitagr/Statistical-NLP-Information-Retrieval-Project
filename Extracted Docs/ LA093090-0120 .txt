Carson City Hall will be closed Fridays beginning next week as most Carson city workers start a four-day work week in an effort by the City Council to meet new state air quality regulations for the Los Angeles basin . The regulations require employers with more than 100 workers at a job site to reduce the number of vehicle trips into and out of the site . Almost all full-time city of Carson employees will be working 10-hour days , but shifts will be juggled to continue services at other city facilities , said Al Vollbrecht , a city spokesman . City Hall will open at 7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. Street sweeping will continue as usual . Code enforcement officers also will continue weekend duty , Vollbrecht said .
