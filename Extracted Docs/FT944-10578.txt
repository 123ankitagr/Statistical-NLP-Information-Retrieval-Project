An amazing political resurrection was achieved by Mr Marion Barry , who regained the Washington DC mayoralty four years after leaving office to serve a six-month prison sentence on drug charges . Widely seen among African-Americans as just one of a series of black public officials targeted by a white prosecutors , he drew support from many middle class blacks , who might otherwise have opposed a disgraced public official . His opponent , Ms Carol Schwartz , turned in a surprisingly strong showing for a white Republican , winning about 44 per cent of the vote in a city that is 10-1 registered Democrats .
