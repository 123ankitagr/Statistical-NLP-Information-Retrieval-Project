The federal government 's newly formed Resolution Trust Corp. said Thursday that it has been named receiver for Founders Savings & Loan in Los Angeles , one of the nation 's largest black-owned thrifts . Federal officials could not be reached for comment , but the move was likely made to set up Founders to be sold or merged with another institution . The troubled savings and loan has been operating under federal supervision since regulators seized it in September , 1986 , and replaced its management . In putting Founders into receivership , the government transferred the assets , deposits , offices and liabilities of the thrift into a new federal institution and will change the name to Founders Federal Savings & Loan . The effect of that move is to wipe out claims of stockholders and debt holders . As of June 30 , Founders had $ 125.9 million in assets and $ 162.4 million in 16,670 deposit accounts . The RTC said Founders will keep operating under normal business hours , managed by agents appointed by the agency . Books , Records in Disarray As of Dec. 31 , Founders was the nation 's fourth-largest black-owned thrift , behind Independence Federal Savings Bank in Washington , Carver Federal Savings Bank in New York and Family Savings & Loan in Los Angeles . Regulators said at the time that Founders was seized that the thrift was suffering from bad commercial and construction loans and its books and records were in disarray . The RTC was formed as part of the new federal savings and loan bailout signed into law by President Bush in August . The agency , which is run by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , has more than 263 other insolvent thrifts under its control . The RTC was named receiver by another new federal agency formed as part of the bailout , the Office of Thrift Supervision .
