president bill clinton yesterday offered more sticks than carrots to north korea to persuade it to accept full nuclear inspections as he ended his visit to south korea with us and north korean officials preparing to hold discussions on the nuclear issue in geneva on wednesday mr clinton and mr warren christopher the us secretary of state reaffirmed that pyongyang must fully comply with international nuclear inspections or face un sanctions if we just stay strong and we stay resolute and we stay firm we know that will work said mr clinton as he toured the demilitarised zone that separates north and south korea eventually we have to hope that north korea will take the sensible course when you examine the nature of the american security commitment to korea it is pointless for them to try to develop nuclear weapons because if they ever use them it would be the end of their country the president promised there would be no cuts in the number of us troops in south korea now totalling 37,000, until the nuclear issue was resolved mr christopher said in a meeting with his south korean counterpart that any improvement in us-north korean relations would depend on the progress in inter-korean ties ruling out the possibility that washington might separately recognise pyongyang in exchange for its full acceptance of nuclear inspections the us has attached other conditions to better relations with north korea including an improvement in human rights and renunciation of terrorism the us last month persuaded north korea to suspend its withdrawal from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty during high-level talks in new york mr christopher said washington would not tolerate north korea dragging its feet endlessly during the new round of talks if no appreciable progress was achieved within a resonable period of time the nuclear issue would be referred to the un security council for action
