Sir , You mention ( 'BAe close to clinching Pounds 250m Taiwanese deal ' , August 26 ) the cautious approach of Taiwanese banks to aircraft leasing due to 'their unfamiliarity with western leasing techniques ' . In the same issue you reported on the GE rescue agreement for GPA 's aircraft-leasing company . Could it be that Taiwanese caution is in fact due to their 'familiarity' with western leasing techniques ? Stephen L Phillips , chairman , Hygicare , Wrexham , Clwyd LL13 8UG
