the drugs industrys view alzheimers disease transformed past two decades obscure untreatable form dementia favourite target research alzheimers disease probably causes human distress victims friends families single disease modern industrial society it known cause 70 per cent cases dementia turning healthy brain cells irreversibly characteristic pattern decaying tangles sticky plaques protein at least 10m people worldwide suffer alzheimers disease the symptoms include progressive memory loss inability carry simple everyday tasks breakdown personality years death alice zilonka aged 73 memorably described early stage uk alzheimers disease society my brain like dark thunderstorm unfortunately prospect lightening personal darkness but glimmer scientific optimism alzheimers researchers begun understand biological basis disease particular microscopic senile plaques neurofibrilary tangles main sign deterioration sufferers brains postmortem examinations the plaques result aggregation betaamyloid protein molecules around decaying nerve terminals brain cells these molecules fragments much larger parent protein known amyloid precursor protein app healthy cells produce small quantities app though normal function unknown excess may lead toxic accumulations betaamyloid several different factors trigger alzheimers process researchers st marys hospital medical school london recently discovered rare inherited forms disease due mutations gene chromosome 21 determines structure app but inherited genetic defects probably account 10 15 per cent alzheimers cases many caused environmental factors triggering excessive app production injured nerve cells one possible factor used subject much interest rather discredited intake aluminium there evidence linking severe head injury development alzheimers viruses may also involved but risk factors unknown clues may come epidemiological studies show alzheimers extremely rare among old people tropical africa common afroamericans grown us reports recent advances alzheimers research fuelled us enthusiastic press releases young biotechnology companies working drugs dementia aroused many experts believe unrealistic public expectation soon effective treatment disease i cant see anything within 10 years really going make impact alzheimers says geoffrey dunbar director smithkline beechams central nervous system therapeutic unit yes theres lot interest app long way away actual drug even area michael traub director clinical neuroscience mercks uk laboratory looks even ahead someone might come fundamental understanding alzheimers disease within next 20 years doesnt mean therell drug 20 years says the types treatment undergoing clinical trials relieve temporarily symptoms particularly memory loss the popular approach improve function neurotransmitters chemical switches cells pass messages the main target acetylcholine neurotransmitter essential memory alzheimers brain severely deficient a class medicines called aminoacridines achieve blocking enzyme destroys acetylcholine brain two drugs velnacrine mentane hoechst germany tacrine cognex warnerlambert us awaiting approval regulatory authorities sides atlantic several earlier stage development but controversial work minority patients improving memory slightly year two cause sideeffects liver damage in addition several existing drugs help disorders nervous system tested effect alzheimers an example selegiline eldepryl sandoz switzerland slows progression parkinsons disease reducing damage done brain cells oxygenfree radicals however holy grail alzheimers research must prevent betaamyloid deposition says jim edwardson director mrc neurochemical pathology unit newcastle upon tyne many pharmaceutical biotechnology companies investing considerable money skill trying develop drugs would prevent amyloid deposition several companies concentrating enzymes involved amyloid metabolism seeking way block destructive formation betaamyloid app but long way clinical trials candidate drugs a complementary avenue research use natural chemicals known nerve growth factors regenerate brain cells damaged alzheimers then distant future might possible stop amyloid deposition process early stage repair damage taken place if effective drugs developed alzheimers disease necessary accurate tests diagnose disease early stages treatment begin serious symptoms appear at present simple diagnostic tests distinguish even advanced alzheimers forms dementia different causes multiinfarct dementia next common form elderly patients series small strokes interrupts blood supply tiny areas brain only postmortem examination brain alois alzheimer carried original description disease 1907 tell definitely whether someone suffered alzheimers but two approaches diagnostic test living patients giving promising results research brain scans soon accurate enough show changes characteristic disease for example oxford project investigate memory ageing based radcliffe infirmary using xray computed tomography ct scanning reveal alzheimersrelated shrinkage part brain important memory medial temporal lobe and nicholas fox alzheimers disease society fellow st marys hospital medical school plans detect early degenerative changes brain magnetic resonance imaging biochemical markers may used diagnose disease follow progress one candidate level app spinal fluid lower alzheimers patients possibly deposited betaamyloid protein brain sibia californian biotechnology company developing antibodybased test based observation any company developing effective drug alzheimers would create new world market potentially worth several billion dollars year but would save least much enabling old people continue living home instead becoming dependent health care system family members assume become crushing physical emotional burden caring above alzheimers cure would end agony millions people end lives minds like dark thunderstorms a realistic assessment suggests people young adults look forward old age free alzheimers the series continue next month look treatments menopause numbers of people aged year 4064
