Country music giants Randy Travis , Loretta Lynn and Clint Black helped lure about 20,000 people eager for a chance to rub elbows with stars to the 19th annual International Country Music Fan Fair . Travis attracted one of the largest crowds Tuesday afternoon , with people lined up around a building to take a picture with the singing star , get an autograph or simply shake hands . Cameras clicked furiously and the crowd oohed and aahed when a youngster in full cowboy regalia was lifted onto a counter next to Black . Zachary Bingham will be 3 this month and is a big country music fan already , says his mother , Sonja Bingham . `` His favorite song is ( Black 's ) 'Nobody 's Home ' and he puts on his boots and his hat along with the words , '' Bingham said . Charley Pride also was a hit at the celebrity show-off event at the Tennessee State Fairgrounds . Beside star contact , the weeklong fair 's $ 70 registration fee lets fans see 40 hours of concerts , visit the Opryland USA show park and tour the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum .
