thoughts inspired by martin bernheimer's feb 16 review of fidelio as produced by the san diego opera company since i moved to orange county 18 months ago i have seen two performances at the dorothy chandler pavilion la cenerentola and macbeth la cenerentola turned up as alice in wonderland with a little girl wandering around the stage for no reason discernable to me and macbeth was a kabuki drama so learning that fidelio had moved from 17th-century spain to 1989 central america comes as no surprise so what if beethoven loses out in the end he's dead as are rossini and verdi and can't really complain arthur e oaks anaheim
