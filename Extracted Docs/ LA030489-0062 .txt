Thoughts inspired by Martin Bernheimer 's Feb. 16 review of `` Fidelio '' as produced by the San Diego Opera Company : Since I moved to Orange County 18 months ago , I have seen two performances at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , `` La Cenerentola '' and `` Macbeth . '' La Cenerentola turned up as Alice in Wonderland with a little girl wandering around the stage for no reason discernable to me , and `` Macbeth '' was a kabuki drama . So learning that Fidelio had moved from 17th-Century Spain to 1989 Central America comes as no surprise . So what if Beethoven loses out in the end ? He 's dead ( as are Rossini and Verdi ) and ca n't really complain . ARTHUR E. OAKS Anaheim
