In the season opener for both teams , El Toro scored all its touchdowns in the first half . It was clear from the opening drive that El Dorado was outclassed . It took El Toro only four plays and less than two minutes to score on a 51-yard pass from Steve Stenstrom to Rob Johnson .

Wanted to welcome El Dorado 's first-year coach , Rick Jones , gently . B . Wanted to play all 53 of his players . C. Is not the type to run up the score . D. Took pity on the Golden Hawks . E. All of the above . `` When a team 's beat , they 're beat , '' Johnson said . Johnson went three deep into his quarterbacks and kept the ball on the ground most of the second half . Stenstrom completed four of five passes for 87 yards and two touchdowns , both to Johnson . He also carried twice for 31 yards . With the score 28-0 after one quarter , he was replaced by Johnson , who completed four of four passes for 33 yards and two touchdowns in one quarter . He then gave way to Brad Milby , who completed three passes for 28 yards . `` We 're very deep at quarterback , '' Johnson said . `` We 've got the best quarterback in the ( South Coast ) league and the second-best quarterback in the league .

Bluth completed one of two passes for 16 yards and carried five times for 36 yards .
