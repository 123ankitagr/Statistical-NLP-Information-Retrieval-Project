Plastic grocery bags in recent years have become standard at most markets . Sometimes the bagger will ask `` plastic or paper ? '' but , if they do n't , the likelihood is that you 'll be lugging groceries home in plastic sacks . San Diego-based Big Bear Markets is trying to change this . In recent weeks the 30-store chain has started encouraging the use of paper bags once again . Plastic is still available , but paper is pushed . Paper containers also have replaced plastic foam in Big Bear delicatessens , and the stores are sprinkled with signs trying to educate customers on such things as buying pump sprays rather than aerosol . As with many environmental issues , the merits of plastic vs. paper packaging are hotly debated . For our money , paper sacks seem the better choice . But the arguments can get complicated . Plastic bags are less bulky , so they take less energy to transport and take up less room in landfills , goes one argument . But paper degrades more easily , is more readily recyclable and comes from a renewable resource . Which products are environmentally safer will take years to sort out . But there is no question that we need to produce less packaging . And Big Bear 's program addresses that as well . It will pay customers 2 cents for each large paper sack they bring back to be reused in packing their next grocery purchase . That is a move in the right direction . Using a grocery sack two or three times genuinely means there will be less waste for the landfill and less pollution in manufacturing and transporting the packaging . Two cents may not be enough incentive to prompt very many customers to bring their own bags to the supermarket , but it 's a start . And , combined with an aggressive marketing program , it helps promote recycling . It 's a way to make people stop and think about packaging and recycling in the grocery store -- the place where we buy so much of what ends up in our trash .
