i was on my way to the surrey docks watersports centre when i came across the story of the whale oil which lit the lamps of london at the watersports centre you can sail canoe or windsurf if you are over eight years old and are able to swim 50 metres in light clothes the whale oil story less bracing but more intriguing is on a docklands heritage information panel near the water's edge at greenland dock it says two hundred years ago you would have been unhappily aware of the awful stench of rotting whale blubber each spring small ships left here for six-week dashes to the icy storm-blown arctic waters off greenland half-rotten whale blubber was brought back in casks and boiled in huge coppers on this dockside to extract the oil much of it was used to light the streets of london two hundred years later the lights are no longer lit with oil and whale hunting is frowned upon the part of the dock on which the information panel appears is now called rainbow quay after the greenpeace ship rainbow warrior which campaigned against whaling in 200 years time visitors to docklands may find the story of the twentieth century anti-whaling movement as interesting as the oil lamps of london for the record there are 11 watersports centres in london docklands a 200-metre artificial ski slope three urban farms and dozens of pubs and restaurants some of them very old there is no leisure activity in docklands however which beats wandering around docklands has acquired an awful reputation in some quarters some of it comes from local activists who objected to the breakneck development of the 1980 s more of it comes from people who have never been there but have persuaded themselves all the same that it has been a disaster many critics in this newspaper as much as any other have excoriated the architecture the toy-town' docklands light railway and much else i cannot understand why it is true that some of the office building is uninspiring but some of the shopping areas in restored wharf buildings are excellent and much of the residential development low-rise and brick is a distinct improvement on most of what was done all over london in the three preceding decades some of the outlying buildings at canary wharf with their transplanted straight-out-of the-box north american look do bear a startling resemblance to the hotels at the euro disney theme park outside paris but the queues are shorter at docklands than at euro disney and entertainment is available at a fraction of the price the docklands light railway swoops and veers like a fairground ride it is easier on the stomach however than disney's big thunder mountain and you can get on and off as you like if the threat of ira bombing had not ended plans to allow visitors to ride the lift to the top of the canary wharf tower there would be no reason to visit the paris theme park at all unlike euro disney docklands surprises are uncontrived they slip from the layers of the past that you unravel on each visit rather than from the minds of the disney imagineers so far-reaching were london's trading links that there is hardly a foreign visitor who is not going to find some docklands connection there is for example the norway cut swing bridge finland quay east and west india quay did you know that the mayflower which took the pilgrim fathers to america in 1620, departed from the riverside quarter of rotherhithe or that its captain christopher james is buried in st mary's churchyard a short walk from the river rotherhithe is a quiet clean settled-looking place the residents could make much more of their american connection if they wanted to perhaps they don't the restored 16 th century pub which was once called the spread eagle is now called the mayflower but apart from a small plaque explaining this it doesn't shout about it the parish church of st mary rotherhithe has been a site of christian worship for nearly 1,000 years the current church splendid in the spring sunshine replaced one built in the twelfth century it was completed in 1715 and was designed by john james an associate of sir christopher wren it beats sleeping beauty's castle a little more care could certainly have been taken to ensure that transport links were developed along with the offices and homes of the new docklands rather than as an after-thought some of the new transport facilities are already looking run-down island gardens station through which many tourists pass on their way to the greenwich foot tunnel was strewn with litter when i was there but all these moans to some extent miss the point to travel through docklands is to realise that it has often been a place of chaos of failed dreams of wild booms and busts of perseverance against the odds german air raids in september 1940 destroyed all the timber in surrey docks 350,000 tons in one night the flames were visible 30 miles away on 57 consecutive nights from september to november 1940, 25,000 bombs rained down on docklands making them the most heavily bombed civilian target in the country but they stayed open once a gateway of world trade docklands calm waters are now free for windsurfing on dry land others had new aspirations for the area no longer the destination of the world's trading ships some such as paul reichmann canary wharf's failed developer believed london's docklands could be the electronic gateway to europe providing the offices from which business would be done at the tap of a computer key those new developers have added another layer to the docklands story future visitors might see the results as the high-water mark of a greedy time whose nemesis was both inevitable and richly-deserved or they might regard the new buildings homes and shops as a testament to a much-maligned decade in which for all the accompanying chicanery and rough manners a somnolent nation awoke however briefly to the promise of the future both interpretations assume the failure of docklands in its newest guise but that failure is not inevitable docklands in its high-tech electronic form might rise again what after all is a four or five-year property slump in a city as old as london in the docklands visitor centre a history of the area tells us that london's prosperity died out after 410 ad but the city boomed again even if did take 300 years
