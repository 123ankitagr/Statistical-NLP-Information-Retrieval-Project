Sarah Vaughan , the legendary singer with the remarkable range and smoky contralto voice that earned her the nickname `` The Divine One , '' has died of lung cancer . She was 66 . Miss Vaughan , who had been released from Cedars-Sinai Hospital earlier Tuesday , died Tuesday night at her home in the exclusive Hidden Hills area of the western San Fernando Valley . Her 87-year-old mother , Ada , and her adopted daughter , Paris Deborah , were at her side when she died . Dubbed `` Sassy '' for her on-stage manner , Miss Vaughan was associated with recordings of such perennial jazz and pop favorites as `` Body and Soul , '' `` It 's Magic , '' `` Misty , '' `` I Cover the Waterfront , '' `` Lover Man , '' `` Here 's That Rainy Day '' and `` Send in the Clowns . '' Despite her fight with cancer , Vaughan had hoped to begin working on a new recording this week . Last Sept. 3 , after Mayor Tom Bradley proclaimed `` Sarah Vaughan Day in Los Angeles , '' she sang with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the Hollywood Bowl , delighting 11,878 with the soaring lyric voice that made her so popular for nearly five decades . `` She just kept becoming greater and greater as the years went on , '' Times jazz critic Leonard Feather , a longtime friend of Miss Vaughan 's who first announced her death , said today . `` In the last few years she was just astonishing . She was the idol and envy of virtually all singers . '' Feather appraised her professional versatility in his `` Encyclopedia of Jazz Singers '' by saying that she was `` capable of incomparable jazz performances yet qualified to be an opera singer . '' That opinion was echoed today by Times music critic Martin Bernheimer , who reviews performances of classical music including opera : '' Sarah Vaughan had a voice of extraordinary sweetness , flexibility and purity , and she used it with uncanny insinuation throughout a wide range . She could have taught many an opera diva lessons in breath control , in legato phrasing and in expressive communication . She was a great singer . Period . '' Miss Vaughan herself had scoffed at attempts to categorize her as a jazz singer . `` I just sing , '' she said . `` I sing whatever I can . '' Born March 27 , 1924 , in Newark , N.J. , to a carpenter and a laundress , she told an interviewer in her maturity that she had never even seen an opera . Her musical training was in the church choir with her mother , first as a singer and later as organist . She claimed that she never envisioned getting into show business , even when she signed up for amateur night at New York 's storied Apollo Theater in 1942 . `` I just quit in the third year of high school and started singing at amateur hours , '' she once told an interviewer . `` The night I won at the Apollo I was only doing it for the $ 10 . '' But Billy Eckstine heard her and recommended that band leader Earl Hines hire her . Her career as concert and recording star was launched . Miss Vaughan had four husbands : trumpeter George Treadwell , former pro football player Clyde Atkins , Las Vegas restaurateur Marshall Fisher and musician Waymon Reed .
