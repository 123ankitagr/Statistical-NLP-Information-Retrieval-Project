about the fees its Mercury Communications subsidiary has to pay BT for channelling calls over its rival 's network . But it is a bit rich to blame yesterday 's management shake-up on the regulatory regime that governs such fees , as some in C & W are prone to . True , the system is ungainly and flawed . But Mercury has known about it for over three years . It has spent too much time complaining about the raw deal it received and not done enough to make the most of a difficult situation . Now the chickens are coming home to roost . Not only are network fees rising ; BT is making sharp cuts in long distance call rates . Given that Mercury has set out its stall as little more than a discount competitor , it has had no option but to match BT 's price cuts . Today 's results from Cable & Wireless are expected to confirm the uncomfortable squeeze in which it finds itself . The management shake-up should enable Mercury to attack its cost base . The new chief executive should find it easier to cut back parts of the operation since he was not involved in building it up . But cost reduction alone will not be enough to give Mercury a sustainable competitive advantage . If it is to differentiate itself from its rivals , Mercury will also need to place a much greater emphasis on innovation and improving the reliability of its service .
