about the fees its mercury communications subsidiary has to pay bt for channelling calls over its rivals network but it is a bit rich to blame yesterdays management shakeup on the regulatory regime that governs such fees as some in cw are prone to true the system is ungainly and flawed but mercury has known about it for over three years it has spent too much time complaining about the raw deal it received and not done enough to make the most of a difficult situation now the chickens are coming home to roost not only are network fees rising bt is making sharp cuts in long distance call rates given that mercury has set out its stall as little more than a discount competitor it has had no option but to match bts price cuts todays results from cable wireless are expected to confirm the uncomfortable squeeze in which it finds itself the management shakeup should enable mercury to attack its cost base the new chief executive should find it easier to cut back parts of the operation since he was not involved in building it up but cost reduction alone will not be enough to give mercury a sustainable competitive advantage if it is to differentiate itself from its rivals mercury will also need to place a much greater emphasis on innovation and improving the reliability of its service
