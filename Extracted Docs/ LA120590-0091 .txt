CBS Tries to Revise Baseball Pact : CBS Sports , which may have lost up to $ 100 million in the first year of its Major League Baseball pact , has asked baseball for some of its money back . CBS Inc. said last month that it expected losses in 1990 's fourth quarter , largely because of its $ 1.06-billion , four-year deal , and now the network apparently wants Major League Baseball to help share the load . Published reports have also said that if baseball is not willing to give CBS a rebate , the network wants more games . CBS showed only 16 regular-season games in its first year of the deal , while ESPN , which paid baseball $ 400 million for four years , showed 161 .
