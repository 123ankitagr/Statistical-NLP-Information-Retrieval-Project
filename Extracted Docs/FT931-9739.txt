ATTEMPTS BY Scottish salmon producers to reduce price fluctuations by creating producer organisations to control output suffered a setback yesterday when Sir Hector Monro , Scottish fisheries minister , gave only limited support to the idea . The Scottish salmon producers , who are now recovering after three bad years in which prices were driven down by vast overproduction of salmon , mainly by Norway , want to set up a number of producer organisations that would restrain production by limiting the number of smolts ( young salmon ) which could be put in the sea through quota restrictions on individual farmers . The Scottish Salmon Growers Association said yesterday that Norway , Ireland and Faroe were also keen to set up associations . Although recommendations on each country 's production would be voluntary to avoid the accusation of being an international cartel , the smolt quotas set by individual producer organisations would be mandatory and would cover both members and non-members . For this reason the producers need the UK government to endorse the scheme for the approval of the European Commission , and bring in legislation or statutory instruments to make the organisations ' decisions mandatory . However Sir Hector said that while he supported the creation of voluntary producer organisations , the government did not want to see compulsory bodies .
