attempts by scottish salmon producers to reduce price fluctuations by creating producer organisations to control output suffered a setback yesterday when sir hector monro scottish fisheries minister gave only limited support to the idea the scottish salmon producers who are now recovering after three bad years in which prices were driven down by vast overproduction of salmon mainly by norway want to set up a number of producer organisations that would restrain production by limiting the number of smolts young salmon which could be put in the sea through quota restrictions on individual farmers the scottish salmon growers association said yesterday that norway ireland and faroe were also keen to set up associations although recommendations on each countrys production would be voluntary to avoid the accusation of being an international cartel the smolt quotas set by individual producer organisations would be mandatory and would cover both members and nonmembers for this reason the producers need the uk government to endorse the scheme for the approval of the european commission and bring in legislation or statutory instruments to make the organisations decisions mandatory however sir hector said that while he supported the creation of voluntary producer organisations the government did not want to see compulsory bodies
