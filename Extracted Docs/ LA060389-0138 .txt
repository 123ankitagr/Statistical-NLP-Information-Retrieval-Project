The FBI office in Phoenix has decided to open a preliminary inquiry into the affairs of Lincoln Savings & Loan and its parent firm , American Continental Corp. , the special agent in charge of the office said Friday . Arizona agents will coordinate their inquiry with a federal grand jury and the FBI office in Los Angeles , where a criminal investigation already has been launched , Special Agent Herb Hawkins said in Phoenix . Hawkins said a preliminary inquiry is a routine step `` to determine if further facts warrant a more detailed investigation '' of Lincoln or American Continental , which filed for bankruptcy on April 13 . Lincoln , an Irvine thrift with major operations in Arizona , was seized by federal regulators the next day . A. Melvin McDonald , a Phoenix lawyer representing American Continental , said the Phoenix FBI office has asked for a list of corporate bondholders . About 22,000 investors bought around $ 200 million in bonds through Lincoln 's 29 branches in Southern California . Those bonds now are nearly worthless , and the bondholders are near the bottom of the list of American Continental creditors who hope to recover funds from U.S. Bankruptcy Court proceedings . American Continental denies any wrongdoing and welcomes the FBI inquiry , McDonald said . The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has asked for a criminal investigation into allegations that American Continental officials illegally profited from their operation of Lincoln . A federal official has said the alleged misdeeds include improper insider loans , fraudulent land sales and manipulation of stock prices . The Securities and Exchange Commission also has been investigating the company .
