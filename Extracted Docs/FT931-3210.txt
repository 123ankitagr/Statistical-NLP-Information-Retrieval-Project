the government may privatise london's docklands light railway by paying the private sector to take it over government advisers are studying the move as one of the most likely options for getting the loss-making railway into private ownership built in the 1980 s for pounds 77 m the docklands light railway is being extended and upgraded at a cost of pounds 800 m to increase capacity and improve reliability earlier this month the department of the environment appointed the consultancy arm of ernst young the accountancy firm to draw up a list of options for privatising the line within the lifetime of this parliament the government is keen to press ahead with the plan because it wants the private sector to build a pounds 130 m extension of the docklands light railway across the thames to lewisham in south-east london a straightforward sale or stock-market flotation of the railway is ruled out by the losses it makes currently more than five times its pounds 3 m annual revenues but ernst young believes the private sector could be offered a dowry to take the railway off the government's hands this could stir up a controversy similar to the one that accompanied the government's recent disposal of the property services agency's projects division to tarmac the construction group with payments or guarantees worth about pounds 100 m another option would be to franchise the operation of the railway to the company wanting the smallest subsidy to run it but this could prove less attractive than an outright sale because the government would remain the owner the railway's performance once notoriously unreliable has improved sharply in the past few months under a new management team headed by sir peter levene former head of defence procurement at the ministry of defence last week sir peter announced that the railway was to pay brown root the us engineering group pounds 30 m over the next three years to get the railway running smoothly and cut its costs mr eric anstey ernst young's director of privatisation and utilities services said the railway could become profitable next decade if the property market recovered and the lewisham extension was built fast track to efficiency page 14
