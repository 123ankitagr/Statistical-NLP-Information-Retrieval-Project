although the british involvement with japanese gardens is very old english gardeners have never tried to follow in any great detail the philosophical ideas which inspire much gardenmaking in japan instead britons have either use garden artefacts from japan or made imitations of them quite often these have been associated japanese plants but in styles of planting and design that are wholly british the story often has been told of the japanese dignitary who was taken to see a japanese garden in england and made the wry comment we have nothing like it in japan the latest example of a japanese garden in britain was opened this spring at capel manor horticultural and environmental centre bullsmoor lane enfield middlesex it sets out to represent what japanese gardening is all about but in visual terms it falls short by attempting too much in too small a space so confusing one type of japanese gardening with another it also uses reproductions rather than genuine japanese ornaments and buildings the 12page folder prepared to explain and illustrate the garden is however excellent and contains a foreword by dr david hessayon which gives an excellent idea of the various styles of japanese gardenmaking he says the basic principles can be set out in 50 words the japanese garden he says is a place where the designer with a selection of stones sand water rocks bamboos andor plants seeks to achieve a harmony between the in low dark delicate feminine damp and the yo high bright strong masculine hard everywhere the in must be balanced by the yo he explains all this in detail and much of the rest of the folder is taken up by illustrations of individual details the purpose of this garden largely is educational and visitors seeking to learn from it evidently are intended to pick and choose what is relative to their particular needs and ideas and not to try to copy the whole i have no quarrel with this but i think that most british gardeners would be well advised to do just as they have been for at least 100 years when employing the japanese tradition that is to use it in whatever british surroundings seem to be pleasing for me there is nothing incongruous about the lovely and genuine japanese rest house in the batsford park arboretum in gloucestershire nor in the lifesized bronze animals there which lord redesdale brought back from japan to place at strategic points in the wide grass rides through the trees there are many fine japanese teahouses in british gardens none more beautiful nor placed more pleasingly than that at heale house middle woodford near salisbury this was built by louis greville early this century and erected by four japanese workmen brought over for the project it stands over two streams which cross each another at right angles one passing under the other in a short conduit there is also a red nikkostyle bridge and all around are lanterns and other japanese ornaments the whole is screened by trees and there are plenty of lush waterside plants but there is no attempt to follow any japanese philosophical idea nevertheless it is beautiful and represents a style of garden making which is very british the most extraordinary japanese garden i know is in ireland at tully house kildare this was made by a japanese specialist tassa eida between 1906 and 1910 and represents life from birth to death a progression through tunnels up hills beside streams and across water there is a teahouse in which the traveller rests before dying it is beautiful and it seems to me to be westernised almost completely the most remarkable situation i know for a japanese garden in britain is outside the formal garden at torosay castle on the isle of mull on the west coast of scotland it is exposed completely to the rough waters of loch linnhe and on a clear day you can see ben nevis here you might regard the garden itself as all in and the landscape in which it is placed as all yo but i do not suppose that whoever made it had that in mind
