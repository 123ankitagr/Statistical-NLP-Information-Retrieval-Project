PEUGEOT UK yesterday became the second major company in Britain to face a strike over pay by manual workers . Conveners and local officials at Coventry will consider this weekend when to launch the full-scale stoppage after a secret ballot by 3,600 production workers earlier this week which produced a rejection of the company 's offer . Workers at the Yarrow shipyard on Clydeside went on indefinite strike over pay last week in one of the biggest wages disputes in Britain for several years . The Peugeot workers are demanding a 'substantial ' pay rise on the eve of the launch of a new model at Peugeot . They rejected the company 's two-year 7.5 per cent pay rise offer with 3.5 per cent this year and the rest in 1994 by a margin of 3 to 1 . Mr Duncan Simpson , Coventry district secretary of the Amalgamated Engineering and Electrical Union , said last night that no further discussions were planned with the company , although Peugeot is expecting to meet the unions next week . Mr Simpson said the Peugeot workers were in a militant mood because the company had decided to cut their rest period from 42 minutes to 30 minutes a shift after June 20 this year . Peugeot insists that this reduction is necessary to improve productivity in its Coventry plant from 57 man hours per car at present to 43 man hours per car by the end of next year . 'In recent years there have been excellent industrial relations at Peugeot , ' said Mr Simpson . 'It is tragic that a strike is looming at the company . ' He said the pay issue had become entangled with the rest period question and heightened tensions . Mr Graham Dymott , spokesman for the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders in the Midlands , said : 'It is a great shame to see what is happening when the auto industry is in such a parlous state . 'We are far removed from the 1970s and 1980s when strikes were one of the main reasons why the industry nearly collapsed . '
