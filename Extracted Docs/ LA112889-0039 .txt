A gravely ill , 22-year-old woman received a liver transplant in San Francisco after a frantic search for a donor organ that included the efforts of Olympic gold medalist Carl Lewis . Officials feared that they would not find a replacement organ in time to save Wendy Marx , who suffers from hepatitis B . But with the aid of a public plea from Lewis , the new liver was obtained from an accident victim in the East . Lewis , who won six gold medals and a silver medal during the last two Olympics , is writing his autobiography with the aid of Marx 's brother , Jeffrey Marx . The woman was listed in stable condition after the transplant operation .
