Giddings , who has worked for the marshal 's office 1 1/2 years , was knocked unconscious in the fight . The incident followed Spells ' conviction by a jury trial of assault with a deadly weapon . Judge Richard Hanscom ordered Spells to appear in Superior Court on April 5 for scheduling of a trial date and arraignment on the new charges .
