China today denied threatening foreign correspondents and said they will be safe if they obey Chinese law . Earlier this week at least six foreign reporters were assaulted by security forces as they covered the first anniversary of the bloody military crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrations . Soldiers pointed guns at eight others . `` We have never threatened any foreign correspondent , '' Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua told reporters . `` I can tell you that if correspondents are not breaking the ethical code of reporters and are abiding by Chinese law , there will be no unpleasantness and their security will be assured , '' she said . She repeated earlier charges that some foreign reporters had engaged in illegal activities or conducted activities incompatible with their status . Li declined to identify the reporters she was accusing , nor would she specify what laws were violated .
