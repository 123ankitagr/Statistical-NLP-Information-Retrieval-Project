conrads cartoon showing a dead hirohito in his casket saying they won the battles but we won the war feb 24 is historically inaccurate in its implication we assume from the cartoon that conrad is fostering the popular notion that the japanese are winning the war economically when they couldnt do it militarily the facts are different in japan prior to world war ii there were two strong opposing policies among the people in the power structure ie whether japan should attempt to dominate and prosper through military means or to pursue business and economic goals as we all know the military people won that struggle at the end of the war the military faction was discredited emperor hirohito was associated with that point of view the people of japan who were for peace and doing business were right the power structure responsible for the war is gone they did not win the war in the postwar era by selling cars and tvs to say that the japanese want to win a war against america fosters jingoism and hatred i think the japanese just want to make a living like the rest of us and are doing a good job at business business isnt war howard mass hacienda heights
