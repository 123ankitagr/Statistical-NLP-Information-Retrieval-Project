USAir said Wednesday that it has slashed unrestricted one-way fares between Sacramento and four Southern California destinations including the county 's John Wayne Airport -- to $ 129 from $ 189 . The move came just days after American Airlines said it would cancel its nonstop flights from John Wayne to the state capital on July 1 . Although the fare reductions appeared in part to be a bid to woo Orange County-to-Sacramento commuters away from American even before the nonstop service is eliminated , the cuts also apply to USAir flights to Sacramento from Los Angeles , Burbank and San Diego . Virginia-based USAir said it has also cut its fare for advance-purchase , seven-day , round-trip tickets between Sacramento and the four Southland airports to $ 128 and has added a new one-day , advance-purchase , round-trip ticket on the same routes for $ 148 . A spokesman for American Airlines said the Dallas-based company is studying the USAir fares and will probably match them . A fare war broke out in late April among carriers with Southern California-Bay Area routes after price-slashing Southwest Airlines announced a $ 29 one-way fare on two routes . American , United and USAir all countered with round-trip , advance-purchase fares of less than $ 100 . Sacramento fares , however , were not discounted .
