it was really hildegard behrens concert at the royal festival hall on tuesday the london philharmonic was there too but only to accompany her in wagner and strauss and to supply a prelude the latter was mahler's full string-band version 1894 of schubert's death and the maiden quartet this curiosity reconstructed from mahler's annotations on a printed quartet score has become unaccountably popular among conductors none of them manages to make massed violins sound remotely plausible in the high flickering descants of the allegro that was the sort of thing mahler would soon be writing for first-violin sections in his own symphonies but in schubert it sounds grotesque here the brave collective effort sometimes swallowed up the main tunes on lower strings as a solo leader could never do the conductor franz welser-most ensured that all of it was at least interesting with enough dynamic hairpins to supply an expressionist hairdresser for several weeks in the great tristan und isolde prelude he achieved smoothness and musical efficiency nothing much like erotic anguish or desperate surges loud yes desperate no then miss behrens took up the liebestod initially in tremulous or perhaps just curdled tones hard to be sure which concluding a strenuous performance of the whole opera the effect might seize one's heart but isolde must soar at last in the liebestod and miss behrens did not because the voice exerted no rhythmic grip of its own soaring needs a firm springboard mild und leise to a fault the behrens soprano floated loosely with too many consonants disappearing altogether over welser-most's fluent accompaniment the special virtue or confluence of virtues that has justified miss behrens career is that her fine unshowy intelligence complements a voice which is soft-grained and yet large and penetrating enough to compete in heroic roles with steelier sopranos in the salome peroration she was grandly audible throughout the orchestral eruptions but also palpably feminine and vulnerable no ferocious brunnhilde overtones such as turn many an operatic salome into an obsessed monster that is meant as a musico-biological observation not a sexist remark behrens conveyed a lethal passion with impassioned innocence
