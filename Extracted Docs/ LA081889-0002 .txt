Former Black Panther Party leader Elmer ( Geronimo ) Pratt was denied parole for the ninth time since the 1968 murder of a Southern California woman during a $ 30 robbery . Board of Prison Terms Commissioner David Brown announced after the hour-long hearing at San Quentin Prison that Pratt , 41 , serving a life sentence , `` is not suitable for parole at this time . '' Brown , who characterized the murder as `` heinous and despicable , '' said the prisoner had consistently refused vocational training and a crucial psychological evaluation . Pratt was convicted in the murder of Carolyn Olson , 27 , a schoolteacher , who was shot to death during the robbery .
