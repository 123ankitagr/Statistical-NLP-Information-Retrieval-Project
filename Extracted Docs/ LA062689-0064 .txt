Legendary record producer and composer Phil Spector is embroiled in a $ 30-million libel suit against author Mark Ribowsky in New York 's state Supreme Court . Ribowsky wrote an unauthorized biography of Spector entitled `` He 's a Rebel : The Truth About Phil Spector -- Rock and Roll 's Legendary Madman '' in which the author alleges that Spector abused his wife and 10-year-old son , is a racist and would demand credit and royalties as a co-writer of songs that he did not write as a condition for producing records . Spector , in his libel suit , has branded the allegations `` false , scandalous and defamatory . '' A month before the biography was published in March , Spector 's attorneys wrote Ribowsky and asked that he delay the publication of the book and supply a copy to Spector so that he could review the book . Spector 's suit said that Ribowsky did not respond to the request.Claudia Puig
