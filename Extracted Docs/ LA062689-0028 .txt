Physical chemist Norman R. Davidson of Caltech last week was named the winner of the 1989 Robert A. Welch Award in Chemistry . The award , which carries a $ 225,000 prize , is considered one of the most prestigious in chemistry . Davidson used the techniques of physical chemistry to devise new ways to visualize , isolate , and manipulate segments of DNA , the genetic blueprint of life . In particular , he and his students devised a technique for attaching labels to individual chemicals in DNA so they could be viewed under a microscope . This and other techniques he developed made possible many of the recent achievements of genetic engineering . Davidson , 73 , has been at Caltech since 1946 .
