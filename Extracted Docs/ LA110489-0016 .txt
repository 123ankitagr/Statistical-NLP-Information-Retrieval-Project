Why are the Rams so predictably frustrating ? Why is it that , even when they were undefeated they did n't seem like a dominant team ? Why do they always seem to play at the level of their opponent ? Why is John Robinson considered a great motivator when his team lacks intensity ? Why have I been a loyal Rams ' fan for 20 years ? CHRIS GRISANTI , Pasadena
