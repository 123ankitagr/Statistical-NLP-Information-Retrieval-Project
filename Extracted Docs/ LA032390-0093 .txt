A 16-year-old Cypress girl whose body was found near a flood control channel in Lakewood died by strangulation , according to preliminary autopsy results released Thursday by the Los Angeles County coroner 's office . The fully clothed body of Zuleima Valdez , a freshman at Cypress High School , was found about 5:45 p.m. Monday by two teen-agers riding bicycles near the Coyote Creek flood control channel , not far from the mobile home the victim shared with her mother . `` The cause of death has been established as strangulation , and it is a homicide , '' Bob Dambacher , a spokesman for the coroner 's office , said . Dambacher said he could not comment on the time of death or if any type of implement was used in the strangulation . He said routine toxicological tests will be conducted to determine if Valdez was given any substances , such as drugs , before she was killed . Results of Thursday 's autopsy will be turned over to the Los Angeles County Sheriff 's Department crime lab . Sheriff 's Department detectives previously had said the body , which showed no obvious signs of trauma , was partially covered with pine needles , leading them to suspect someone may have tried to hide it . Valdez left home Sunday night , telling her mother she was going to the beach with friends . When she failed to return , the mother reported her missing to police .
