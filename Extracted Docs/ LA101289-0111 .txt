a broad series of experiments suggest that it may be possible to defuse the immune system in humans to treat and even prevent diseases like multiple sclerosis and diabetes researchers in oregon and san diego independently report they have used a synthetic molecule to immunize mice against an autoimmune disease in which the body's own immune system attacks its host that is widely used as a model for multiple sclerosis clinical trials of the approach could be undertaken in humans within a year moreover researchers at harvard are already using special antibodies in humans in an attempt to knock out ms patients own antibodies that are producing the disease stanford researchers are preparing to do the same the harvard researchers are also vaccinating some ms patients with immune cells in an attempt to protect them from the ravages of the disease there is a great excitement about extending these animal efforts to humans said neurologist dale mcfarland of the national institutes of health in bethesda md we need things to get excited about it's good for the patients to know that there are a lot of people still trying ms is a paralyzing neurological disease that affects as many as 250,000 people in the united states it usually strikes in young adulthood and lasts for the remainder of the victim's life often 20 to 30 years there is no effective treatment although many patients go through long periods of spontaneous remission the disease occurs when the victim's immune system goes awry and attacks the insulating protein sheath that surrounds nerve cells effectively short-circuiting nerve impulses and producing the disease's characteristic symptoms weakness tremors disturbances of speech and vision and ultimately paralysis in rodents and some other animals an ms-like disease called experimental allergic encephalitis eae can be produced by injecting the animals with ground-up nerve tissue in an overreaction to the injected tissues the animals immune systems begin to attack their own nerve tissues producing ms symptoms the attack is carried out by immune cells called t cells that normally proliferate in response to an infection and destroy the foreign invader in ms some of the person's immune cells inexplicably attack the nerve cells insulating sheaths ms researchers in the past have used drugs that wipe out all t cells in an attempt to halt the progression of ms but such drugs leave the ms patient highly susceptible to life-threatening infections the goal of most research now is to deactivate only those specific t cells that are attacking the nerve sheath while leaving the rest of the immune system intact the two major and complementary ways of doing this are called active and passive immunization in passive immunization the researchers attack the t cells that have already been formed if for example they know which specific type of t cell is attacking neural sheaths in eae the animal form of ms they can produce special antibodies called monoclonal antibodies that bind to the t cells and help destroy them several researchers have shown that monoclonal antibodies can slow and even reverse the progress of eae as well as diabetes in mice and rats neurologist howard l weiner and his colleagues at harvard medical school and brigham and women's hospital in boston have used such antibodies to treat about 20 human ms patients in their safety trials they have shown that the antibodies suppress the functioning of the t cells thought to be involved in ms but they are not yet sure if they produced any remission of the disease because ms often goes into remission spontaneously neurologist lawrence steinman of the stanford university medical center is planning to begin similar trials soon in an active approach such as that reported today in the journal nature the researchers hope to prevent the formation of the destructive t cells in the first place the foundation for this approach was laid by immunologist irun cohen of the weizmann institute of science in israel for 10 years cohen has been isolating from rodents the t cells that cause eae diabetes and arthritis treating them with radiation or chemicals to deactivate them so they do not cause harm and injecting them back into the animals the immune system produced antibodies against the injected t cells and thus against the identical t cells produced by the animals bodies these antibodies hold the t cells in check and thereby block progression of the disease weiner has already tried this approach in three human patients isolating t cells from spinal fluid deactivating them and reinjecting them as was the case with the monoclonal antibodies the injections suppressed the undesired immune function but weiner has not yet been able to determine the clinical effects other researchers are expected to begin similar trials soon the results reported in nature represent a more sophisticated way of achieving the same end neurologist arthur a vandenbark and his colleagues at the veterans affairs medical center in portland ore synthesized a small chemical called a peptide that is a key part of the t cells that are involved in eae when they vaccinated rats with the peptide the rats no longer developed eae when they were subsequently injected with ground nerve tissue this approach is preferable to the use of whole cells because it is more widely applicable in treating humans the patient's own deactivated cells must be used so that the injection does not cause an adverse immune reaction but a peptide would not trigger such a reaction and could be used to treat anyone immunologists stephen brostoff and marc howell of immune response corp in san diego said wednesday they have achieved virtually identical results using a slightly different peptide a report of their findings was presented at a recent meeting in england and will appear shortly in the journal science brostoff said his company hopes to begin trials in humans within a year while vandenbark predicted he would begin trials in one or two years background multiple sclerosis is a chronic neurological disease that causes weakness tremors and paralysis in as many as 250,000 americans it results when the patient's own immune system goes awry and there is no effective therapy for it researchers have been attempting to halt its progression by interfering with the immune system activity that causes the disease
