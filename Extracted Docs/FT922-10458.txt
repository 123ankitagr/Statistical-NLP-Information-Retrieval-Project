if japan has a national goal for the 1990 s it is to bridge the gap between its first-world economy and third-world standard of living by focusing massive investment on a woefully inadequate social infrastructure a widely-held view that average citizens have not benefited fully from the nation's rising affluence coupled with us pressure to drastically boost domestic demand prompted the government in june 1990 to pledge y430 000 bn in infrastructure spending over the next decade that total is equal to slightly more than last year's gross national product and should roughly double from the previous decade the annual growth rate of public investment to 6-7 per cent as it did in the first year of the programme which ended this march the government also decided in early april to front-load' the fiscal 1992 public works budget by spending 70 per cent in the first six months to jump-start the sputtering economy this alone will not inject new revenues over the full year but a supplemental budget now appears likely thirty per cent of construction activity is public works and 70 per cent private at most general construction and mid-sized companies so public spending alone cannot offset private declines says ms akemi toyonaga construction industry analyst for credit lyonnais securities japan government spending shaped both by need and political considerations will be funneled into three broad areas residential infrastructure centering on housing sewers parks and traffic control public facilities such as airports harbours railways roads and erosion and flood control systems and industry-related programmes focusing on waste and environmental management among the varied targets are expanding average housing floor space over the decade from 89 square metres in 1988 to 95 sq m increasing the number of homes connected to sewerage systems to 60 per cent from 40 per cent over the same period and enlarging by half the trading vessel harbour space by 1995 twenty or 30 years ago big infrastructure projects involved the so-called bottleneck programme for industry but from now on the main concentration will be on people's living standards says thejapan development bank the biggest uncertainty affecting the government's initiative is the price of land reflation could mean using far more than the 15 per cent of the y430 000 bn budgeted for real estate purchases and lessen the impact says the bank an economic planning agency committee is set to release an infrastructure policy review in may or june in which the most notable feature will be proposed user fees to help cover the enormous expense of the government's many initiatives he predicts in general the difference this spending makes is going to be felt on the micro level neighbourhood by neighbourhood and hopefully it will be followed by private investment especially in housing to improve people's immediate quality of life adds mr peter sanborn senior analyst at jardine fleming securities the large projects may attract attention from the media and contractors but in the end they are likely to be far less important to average japanese among the largest of high-profile undertakings are new airports faced with an acute capacity shortage the government is increasing total airport construction spending by nearly 70 per cent in fiscal 1991-95 from the previous five years to y3 220 bn dollars 24 bn the flagship facility is the new kansai international airport off the coast of osaka the y1 430 bn island terminal will be the cornerstone of the kansai region's efforts to draw business to osaka kobe and kyoto and will be japan's first 24-hour air terminal the venture has run into problems including more sinking than expected of the man-made island on which the airport sits and it is now set to open in mid-1994 about 15 months behind schedule the cost has also risen 40 per cent partly because of expanded terminal capacity says a spokeswoman for kansai international airport when completed the airport will be connected to the mainland by a road and rail bridge and accommodate nearly double the capacity of the area's current air terminal big airport projects also are planned at several regional capitals while the narita and haneda airports serving tokyo are also being significantly expanded waterfront development is another big initiative area although much of the capital is private along japan's most congested waterfront the trans-tokyo bay highway is scheduled in 1998 to connect kawasaki just south-west of the capital with kisarazu on the relatively pristine boso peninsula site of the kazusa research park and numerous tourist and resort developments the project now well under way involves building bridges tunnels and artificial islands at an estimated cost of y1 150 bn another structure at the mouth of tokyo bay and the akashi straits bridge on seto island will be the world's two longest suspension bridges the tokyo bay area is being transformed by numerous other large projects including several on artificial islands one of the biggest is the municipal government's tokyo teleport recently delayed two years and set to open in 1996, and the tokyo international convention park private consortiums also are developing large commercial and residential ventures in the area a new train line loop highway system and road extensions will provide access the nihon convention centre makuhari messe and a monorail are already operating and construction is in progress of scores of related facilities in yokohama the y2 000 bn minato mirai 21 project will house japan's tallest building 75 stories high on reclaimed land it will join yokohama hall and two already completed museums and numerous private projects japan's quasi-public organisations are another source of heavy infrastructure spending for example the japan railways jr group plans to extend its bullet train lines the railway technical research institute a jr affiliate with national and local government support is conducting the more ambitious of japan's two magnetic levitation maglev linear railway development projects if successful it will help revolutionise train travel and cut by two thirds the travelling time between tokyo and osaka to one hour the group is now building a y340bn 27-mile track in yamanashi prefecture 80 miles from tokyo to test full-sized rail cars at speeds of up to 310 mph many technological hurdles are yet to be overcome including big advances in energy efficiency and the prevention of suspected health risks linked with exposure to electromagnetic radiation commercialisation is not expected until at well into the next decade at least by some estimates the phenomenal cost of building a new line along the congested tokyo-osaka corridor could delay it indefinitely hsst corporation of nagoya is separately promoting three schemes including an inter-city maglev railway that would cruise at 186 mph a commuter version and a downtown people-mover the group includes nagoya railroad and aichi prefecture and it hopes full-scale testing recently begun will attract national subsidies for a nagoya commuter line japan's now private telecoms giant nippon telegraph telephone is also planning an aggressive infrastructure enhancement programme in the 1990 s combined with the jr it will add some y25 000 bn to infrastructure spending in addition the nation's 10 electric power companies will invest trillions of yen to increase generating capacity 16.2 per cent in the next five years alone
