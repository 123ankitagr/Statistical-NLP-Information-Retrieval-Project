chinas official media yesterday highlighted what was described as an important breakthrough in talks between chinese and taiwanese officials but gave less weight to the story than newspapers in taiwan peoples daily the communist party newspaper on page three of its international edition reported that common ground had been achieved on functional issues such as the repatriation of hijackers fishing disputes and the return of mainland chinese working illegally in taiwan but observers in taipei cautioned that while the outcome of the talks the sixth round since groundbreaking meetings in april 1993 had smoothed crossstrait waters for the time being underlying political tensions would be likely to escalate in the future reports in the chinese press were consistent in tone with the need for workmanlike discussions beijing had emphasised in the leadup to the talks between mr tang shubei secretarygeneral of chinas quasiofficial association for relations across the taiwan straits and his taiwanese counterpart chiao jenho of the straits exchange foundation while beijing is treating the latest developments in a sober manner there is no doubt it is taking seriously the process begun in singapore in 1993 when the two sides agreed at a highly publicised meeting to explore ways to broaden contacts as part of a confidence building process impetus has been given to the discussions by beijings growing concern shared by the taiwanese leadership about a strengthening nationalist movement in taiwan chinas leaders will not have overlooked opinion polls showing an increasing number of taiwanese favouring independence chinas avowed aim is to achieve reunification of taiwan with the mainland but whereas in the past it had insisted there was plenty of time to achieve this gains made in recent elections by opposition parties committed to independence have changed beijings approach mr tang gave voice to these concerns in comments after the two sides reached agreement on sunday describing crossstraits ties as very complicated he added whomever tries to cut these ties and create hostile feelings is serving noones interests while it would be stretching a point to describe mr tangs visit to taiwan as part of a charm offensive there is also no doubt that he was at pains to show a human face to the taiwanese to counter the independence tide mr tang may also have wished to make amends for chinas mishandling of a boat tragedy in march in which 24 taiwanese tourists were murdered while sightseeing on a lake near hangzhou south of shanghai mr hu fo a politics professor at national taiwan university said the talks certainly helped restore a certain spirit of harmony consensus and mutual trust damaged by the incident but the basic problems which existed well before the incident remain this will make it extremely difficult to reach similar agreements on a political level mr shih mingteh chairman of the opposition democratic progressive party denounced the talks which he said beijing had used merely to get ties back on track mainland chinese media have expressed the hope that further high level discussions can be held soon including a repeat of the summit in singapore between senior figures from both sides china would like to force the pace on such issues as direct shipping and air links but taiwan remains nervous fearing being drawn into a suffocating embrace beijing for its part wishes to encourage trade and investment further taiwanese investment in the mainland exceeds usdollars 10bn pounds 65bn and would receive a significant boost if barriers to direct contacts were removed
