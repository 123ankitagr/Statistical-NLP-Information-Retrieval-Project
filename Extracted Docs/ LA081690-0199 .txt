buena park police training officer gary jackson a captain in the army reserve was a little worried wednesday he has teenage daughters who love $ 60 guess jeans and one daughter is on the verge of getting married if president bush calls up reservists for active duty as he was considering wednesday jackson would soon have less money for designer jeans and might not be around for the nuptials he is one of 14425 military reservists and national guardsmen in orange county and if bush calls them to active duty in the iraqi conflict the impact on individuals like jackson and on businesses could be substantial by law bush has the power to call up reserves for at least three months and can extend that tour of duty another three months beyond that the president must get approval from congress employees called for involuntary duty in the reserves are entitled to reinstatement in their old job or an equivalent one at the same pay they held before their military stint but like jury duty the terms of a workers leave from salary to medical benefits are up to the employer and in orange county a check wednesday indicated those terms vary widely for jackson a return to active duty would spell both financial and personal hardship the police department would pay him two weeks salary but after that his active duty salary of $ 3500 a month as an army captain would kick in it is less than his civilian earnings jackson 42 who helped to set up and train a new national police force in panama last year during the us intervention has been in the army reserve for 2 12 years he was unconcerned about his job security but fretted more about his daughters wedding before 200 guests it would be a shame to miss my daughters wedding jackson said wednesday i just hope the call comes after the first of the month ill be losing some but for someone in an enlisted rank it will be much harder obviously because the pay is lower lowranking reservists can make as little as $ 50 a day on active duty in santa ana attorney kevin mcdermott and his law partner robison harley are closely watching bushs pending decision to call up reserves mcdermott is a captain in the marine corps reserve and harley a lieutenant colonel a call to active duty would essentially kill their law practice youve got a number of clients and you either have to persuade a judge to delay the case or pick up the phone and call a lot of clients and refund a lot of money mcdermott said wed just have to shut down the whole practice i think both of us would probably take a hell of a beating and his staff of four also would be without jobs but he added he and thousands of others who sign on for their four to sixyear reserve duty knew the potential for that call which could take them to any post at home or abroad the bush administration has been considering mobilizing some of the nations 16 million reserves and national guardsmen to fill positions vacated by thousands of troops bound for the persian gulf defense secretary dick cheney and army gen colin powell chairman of the joint chiefs of staff briefed bush at the pentagon on wednesday on the middle east crisis and what military experts consider the largest us military deployment since the vietnam war bush cheney and powell also discussed the possibility of activating 200000 reservists the maximum allowed by law unless the country is at war if that happens it will be the largest deployment of reserves since the vietnam war they were looking at the callup of the guard and reserves as an option and there was nothing being done with it at this time pentagon spokesman doug hart said national guard units are state militia overseen by governors hence a presidential order activating reserves would not affect them pentagon spokeswoman jan bodanyi said yet hart said that does not rule out the national guard entirely they are as ready as reserves he said all of them train on an active basis so the way a callup would happen is military leaders would figure out the needs and demands and take those with specialties in either the guard or the reserves to fill those needs in orange county the national guard with 13000 people far outnumbers the reserves of other services military officials in washington said orange county is home to 400 naval reservists 1025 marine reservists and a substantial number of army reservists based at los alamitos in california as a whole there are 130000 reservists pentagon officials said the current situation is we have reservists and national guardsmen who are supporting our efforts in the middle east as volunteers bodanyi said as with jury duty she said employers are allowed to make mostly their own arrangements for compensation and job security for workers who are volunteer reserves from orange countys largest employer hughes aircraft co to the familyrun diner around the corner the terms for those in the reserves vary widely ray silvius a spokesman for fullertonbased hughes said the company grants military leaves to reservists and guarantees that their jobs will be protected until they return he said he did not know how many of the firms 12000 employees are reservists but he indicated that a callup would not have a major impact on hughes at disneyland 8000 fulltime employees are guaranteed a military leave of up to 30 days spokesman bob roth said the amusement park also supplements armed services salaries so that employees take home something equivalent to their usual pay however roth said jobs are not guaranteed beyond a 30day leave the los angeles times with 10000 employees 1200 of them in orange county grants unpaid military leave to both full and parttime workers for as long as service is required however employees must apply for their jobs within 90 days after being released from service if they want to retain employment rights employees are not required to apply their vacation time to military leave by far the majority of employers are very supportive of their employees reserve service said pentagon public affairs specialist brian r kilgallen if there are problems the department of labor has the statutory responsibility to assist the service member and the department of defense has an organization to help mediate any problems
