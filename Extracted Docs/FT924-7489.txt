Police evacuated the Canary Wharf area of east London last night before disabling a large explosive device found in a Ford Transit van parked under a Docklands light railway station about 20 yards from the offices of The Daily Telegraph . Two men in the van were challenged by security guards , but threatened them with a gun and drove off in a car which was later found abandoned . The Telegraph lost a large part of its print run .
