donald trump is in his headquarters office on the 26 th floor of trump tower a glittering high-rise on new york's fifth avenue seated on the far side of one of america's larger executive desks he has agreed to talk about the the rise and fall and rise again of donald j trump but time is money and his attention span is notoriously short quickly then the story so far two years ago it looked as though mr trump or the donald as people call him might no longer have his desk his office his tower or any of the rest of the property and casino empire he built up during the 1980 s brought to the edge of bankruptcy by a combination of debt and collapsing asset values he seemed destined to go the same way as the reichmann brothers robert campeau and other over-extended victims of the decade of excess and yet he has survived helped by the cashflows from his casinos he has reorganised or paid off a large part of his debts his private yacht may have gone so has the trump shuttle airline now part of usair and a 49 per cent stake in the plaza hotel in new york but the rest of the empire the trump tower trump parc trump palace and trump plaza high-rises in new york and the trump plaza trump's castle and trump taj mahal casinos in atlantic city is remarkably intact now at 47, the donald is making his comeback last month he married marla maples the 30-year-old actress who eight weeks earlier had given birth to their daughter tiffany admittedly the bride's dollars 2 m tiara was borrowed from a new york jeweller but the wedding put the trump name back in the headlines across the world next mr trump plans to return to the headlines with his business deals in a few weeks time he hopes to pay off the rest of his personal debt by floating his atlantic city casinos on the stock market he says he is looking at five or six possible locations for new casinos or riverboat casinos outside atlantic city and in new york he aims to press ahead with his long-dormant dollars 3 bn project to develop the 75-acre penn central railway yards in manhattan mr trump acknowledges that he was in deep trouble at the turn of the decade but it happened to everybody virtually the real estate markets were collapsing throughout the world his personal low he says came at the beginning of 1991, when his financial difficulties coincided with the bitter divorce proceedings that ended his marriage with ivana zelnicek he also acknowledges that he sacrificed some assets to get himself out of trouble but only he says unimportant ones a yacht is an easy thing i sold the yacht because i never got to use it because i was too busy i sold some of the toys but the big toy the great toy is mar-a-lago his palatial estate in palm beach florida i never sold that times were hard i had a couple of bad years says mr trump and the mauling the media gave him led him to sympathise with others who suffer the same fate one of the people that i think has gotten a really bad rap somebody i know just little bit because he was at my home mar-a-lago is prince charles from your country i think he's a wonderful guy he's taken a lot of heat i think he could get a little better press but on the issue that really matters the state of the trump organisation his recurring theme is that the business is stronger than ever the taj mahal one of the three atlantic city casinos has just set an all-time record it made a profit of dollars 135 m last year no casino in history has ever made that much money while it is true that the casinos are doing well it is less easy to determine what the trump organisation is worth in 1992, business week the us business magazine calculated that mr trump's liabilities exceeded his assets by dollars 1.4 bn mr trump disputed the figure at the time and in any case it is long out of date but not even the donald will attempt to put a value on his business it's a very substantial number he says but i really can't tell you exactly because it's very hard to value what the taj mahal's worth or what the trump plaza's worth or what the land's worth in one sense it doesn't much matter investing in the trump organisation was always an act of faith and is likely to stay that way that is how the donald says it should be if a person owning bonds in the taj mahal didn't sell their bonds those bonds would be golden that investment would be gold if they sold them i can't help them because they weren't loyal but the people who were confident in me all came out ahead the hard times taught him a lot about loyalty he says some people he hadn't much liked turned out to be good friends and others he trusted let him down there are a couple of people i trusted who i'm glad that i learned weren't particularly loyal and now they're coming back to me kissing my ass and wanting to get back on the gravy train and they haven't got a shot but what drives the donald to do what he does a lust for power or wealth or beautiful women is it sheer egomania that makes him want to acquire more and bigger buildings and put his name on them or some displaced desire for immortality i hate to sound like an overly negative person but people ask me why i go forward and i say it's because i have nothing else to do because it's true what else am i going to do watch television read a book i read books anyway but i mean what else am i going to do we're here we're put on this earth for an average of 72.3 years and after we've gone who the hell knows what happens and in the meantime i just like the game the donald is getting fidgety clearly his attention span has reached its limit at some unseen sign people have started wandering in through the open door to his office ready to start the next meeting come in henry says the donald sit down henry just sit down i'm just finishing up an interview with the financial times it's going to be a very negative story based on the questions but you know what who gives a shit i don't even care one of the things i've learned is that i just don't care
