How ironic that on the front page we read how six Catholic priests are willing to lay down their lives in the cause of democracy in Central America , and on the same front page that an American Catholic bishop uses his holy office to punish an American for using her right of free speech in our democracy ( `` Pro-Choice Lawmaker Is Barred From Church Rite , '' Nov. 17 ) . As a child I remember how proud my Northern Ireland Catholic father was that a Catholic was elected President of this country , overcoming the bigoted fears of a `` papist '' presidency . And how well he taught me what happened in Northern Ireland when the interests of democracy were subservient to those of religious zealots . Thank God he is not alive today to see the American Catholic hierarchy repeating the terrible mistakes of the past by coercing our politicians into becoming `` agents of Rome . '' KEVIN P.
