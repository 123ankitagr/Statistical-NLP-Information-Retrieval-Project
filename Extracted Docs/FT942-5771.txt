Finland 's Kone yesterday extended its concentration on its core elevator operations by announcing the sale of Kone Wood , a supplier of wood handling equipment , to Andritz AG of Austria . The sale , on undisclosed terms , is Kone 's third big disposal in the last nine months . Last September it sold Mac-Gregor-Navire , the world 's leading supplier of shipboard cargo handling equipment , to Sweden 's Incentive for about SKr500m ( Dollars 63.3m ) and in March it sold its cranes unit for more than FM600m ( Dollars 110m ) . Kone 's majority owner , the Herlin family , recently rejected an offer from Germany 's Thyssen group for its entire shareholding . It controls about 40 per cent of Kone 's capital and 70 per cent of the votes . Kone , one of the world 's three leading elevator manufacturers , says its remaining non-core activities , Kone Instruments , GS-Hydro and a steel foundry are also for sale .
