PART of British Coal 's defunct Coventry Colliery at Keresley , West Midlands , could become an import and export centre for Peugeot and Citroen cars . The Wooton group , through its development manager Ashford Developments , wants to turn the surface site of the colliery into a multi-use industrial and commercial area , which could create up to 2,000 jobs . The proposals include use of the colliery 's existing railhead as a transport and distribution centre for Peugeot , the French car group , which also includes Citroen . Peugeot has a manufacturing plant at nearby Ryton . Ashford Developments has prepared the proposals for the car distribution centre on behalf of Gesco , a wholly owned transport and distribution subsidiary of the Peugeot group . Gesco is understood also to be examining other possibilities for a regional depot close to the Ryton plant . The Keresley site is potentially attractive to Peugeot because it offers the opportunity to move cars directly by rail to the group 's distribution terminal at Calais after the Channel tunnel opens next year . It would also facilitate distribution of Peugeot and Citroen cars in the Midlands . Currently the cars are distributed through an import-export centre at Sheerness , Kent . The Coventry pit is also the subject of a bid from Coal Investments , the company led by Mr Malcolm Edwards , former commercial director of British Coal , who wants to re-open the mine . The company has also bid to re-open the Trentham colliery in Staffordshire under licence .
