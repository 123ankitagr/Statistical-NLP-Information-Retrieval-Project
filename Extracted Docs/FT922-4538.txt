if one comment about canary wharf particularly wounded olympia york it was likening the docklands to croydon the irony is that the comparison is if anything unfair to croydon croydon is the sixth largest office centre in the uk although it has the same amount of office space as the docklands 10 m sq ft the vacancy rate in croydon is just 8 per cent compared with about 50 per cent in the docklands the dockland's transport system is still embryonic while croydon has 20 railway stations and two motorways on its doorstep in stark contrast with the docklands the growth of croydon in the 1960 s was a triumph for its developers and croydon corporation which fostered it but not everything is going croydon's way office rents have fallen by up to 30 per cent in the past 18 months and office vacancies are likely to increase as leases expire and company relocations slow down perhaps the most damaging aspect of croydon is the appearance of its serried ranks of tired 1960 s office blocks but if croydon's 1960 s architecture is now heartily despised what chance do the bland facades of the docklands have of standing the test of time
