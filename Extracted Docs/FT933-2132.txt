MR John Cahill , British Aerospace chairman , will pay a 'courtesy visit ' to Taiwan this week , the company said yesterday . The trip comes as Taiwanese opposition politicians are questioning a planned joint venture between BAe and Taiwan Aerospace ( TAC ) to build regional jet aircraft in the UK and Taiwan . The joint venture , called Avro , is part of Mr Cahill 's strategy to improve the company 's profitability . It would also allow Taiwan to enter the civil airliner business . Avro has had to clear a series of hurdles raised by Taiwanese banks lending money to the joint venture company . Some politicians have also expressed their doubts . BAe said that Mr Cahill 's visit was unrelated to any opposition to the joint venture .
