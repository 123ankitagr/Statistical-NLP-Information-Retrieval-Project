Reynolds to Stop Some Recycling : Reynolds Aluminum Recycling Co. will discontinue recycling glass and plastic beverage containers at three centers because it says provisions of California law are forcing the aluminum industry to subsidize glass and plastic recycling . Because redemption prices for glass and plastic containers fail to cover their recycling costs , the company may end up spending $ 1 million this year `` subsidizing the recovery of glass and plastic for recycling , '' according to Charles W. Rayfield , vice president and general manager of Reynolds ' Orange-based recycling subsidiary .
