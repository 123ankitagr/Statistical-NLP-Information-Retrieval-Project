When two former Consolidated Gold Fields executives , Mr Michael Beckett and Mr Anthony Ciali , were called in by big shareholders at the then-troubled Monarch Resources , a small UK-quoted company , two years ago , it was always on the cards that they would recruit some of their former colleagues to help revitalise Monarch , which has gold assets in Venezuela . While at Gold Fields , Mr Beckett and Mr Ciali helped to build Gold Fields Mining Corporation into one of North America 's lowest-cost and most profitable gold producers . Now they are welcoming Mr Jim Gourdie , until recently GFMC 's vice president-production , to Monarch where he has been appointed vice president , operations . Mr Gourdie will be based in Caracas and will take responsibility for Monarch 's Dollars 23m La Comorra gold project in Venezuela and its mill at Revemin . Mr Ciali said that Mr Gourdie 's 'broad background in the successful development , operation and management of state-of-the-art gold mines will be a tremendous asset to Monarch ' . GFMC was acquired by the Hanson Anglo-American conglomerate when it paid Dollars 3.5bn for Consolidated Gold Fields in 1989 . Hanson recently agreed to swap GFMC , which has two gold mines , in California and Nevada , for the coal and aggregate businesses of Sante Fe Pacific .
