Seventy years ago today , a first-year outfielder for the New York Yankees hit his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a doubleheader at the Polo Grounds . So what ? So , George Herman ( Babe ) Ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season . In the next several weeks , he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home runs , too . He was on his way to a home run record that , in 1920 , was almost beyond belief -- he would hit 54 , then 59 in 1921 . Reference points : When Ruth hit 54 in 1920 , the second-highest total in baseball that year was 19 , by George Sisler . Only one other team in the American League that year hit more than 44 home runs . When he hit his 30th homer that afternoon , it was the 138th of Ruth 's career , making him , at 25 , the all-time home run leader . Many baseball historians claim today that Ruth 's 1920 and '21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by any hitter in baseball history . And many even believe either season was superior to his more famous 1927 season . Ruth played in only 142 games in 1920 , yet drove in 137 runs . His home run percentage that season was 11.8 % , compared to 1927 , when it was 11.1 % as he hit 60 in 151 games . But most impressive of all , Ruth 's slugging percentages in 1920 and '21 were .847 and .846 . Neither figure has ever been approached . In fact , a slugging percentage higher than .704 has been achieved only 20 times , eight by Ruth . Ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever . His .772 mark for 1927 is No . 3 . No . 4 is Lou Gehrig 's .765 in 1927 . Ruth and Gehrig are on the top-20 list 11 times . The most recent player to make the top 20 was Ted Williams , who hit .731 in 1957 to rank 12th . Ruth joined the Yankees after the 1919 season , when Boston sold him to New York . In his last Red Sox season , playing in 130 games , Ruth was 9-5 as a pitcher , and hit 29 home runs -- then a record -- and drove in 114 runs as an outfielder . Before 1920 , no 20th-Century player had ever hit 30 , 40 or 50 homers in a season . Only three had ever hit 20 , and one was Ruth . Three late-19th Century players hit between 20 and 27 home runs , but some of those , it is believed , were inside-the-park homers , many coming in fenceless ballparks . So in 1920 , no one had ever seen this kind of home run production . As recently as 1918 , Ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs . And people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches . The Yankees , who after two more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark -- Yankee Stadium , a.k.a . `` The House that Ruth Built '' -- became the first team to draw 1 million fans in a season , in 1920 . They drew 1,289,422 , breaking the previous attendance mark by 380,000 .
