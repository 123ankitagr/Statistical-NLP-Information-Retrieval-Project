seventy years ago today a first-year outfielder for the new york yankees hit his 30 th and 31 st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a doubleheader at the polo grounds so what so george herman babe ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season in the next several weeks he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home runs too he was on his way to a home run record that in 1920, was almost beyond belief he would hit 54, then 59 in 1921 reference points when ruth hit 54 in 1920, the second-highest total in baseball that year was 19, by george sisler only one other team in the american league that year hit more than 44 home runs when he hit his 30 th homer that afternoon it was the 138 th of ruth's career making him at 25, the all-time home run leader many baseball historians claim today that ruth's 1920 and 21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by any hitter in baseball history and many even believe either season was superior to his more famous 1927 season ruth played in only 142 games in 1920, yet drove in 137 runs his home run percentage that season was 11.8 compared to 1927, when it was 11.1 as he hit 60 in 151 games but most impressive of all ruth's slugging percentages in 1920 and 21 were 847 and 846 neither figure has ever been approached in fact a slugging percentage higher than 704 has been achieved only 20 times eight by ruth ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever his 772 mark for 1927 is no 3 no 4 is lou gehrig's 765 in 1927 ruth and gehrig are on the top-20 list 11 times the most recent player to make the top 20 was ted williams who hit 731 in 1957 to rank 12 th ruth joined the yankees after the 1919 season when boston sold him to new york in his last red sox season playing in 130 games ruth was 9-5 as a pitcher and hit 29 home runs then a record and drove in 114 runs as an outfielder before 1920, no 20th-century player had ever hit 30, 40 or 50 homers in a season only three had ever hit 20, and one was ruth three late-19th century players hit between 20 and 27 home runs but some of those it is believed were inside-the-park homers many coming in fenceless ballparks so in 1920, no one had ever seen this kind of home run production as recently as 1918, ruth co-led the major leagues with 11 home runs and people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches the yankees who after two more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark yankee stadium a k a the house that ruth built became the first team to draw 1 million fans in a season in 1920 they drew 1,289,422, breaking the previous attendance mark by 380,000 comparison of the early years year g ab h 2 b 3 b hr r rbi bb avg 1920 142 458 172 36 9 54 158 137 148 376 1921 152 540 204 44 16 59 177 171 144 378 1927 151 540 192 29 8 60 158 164 138 356
