seventy years ago today a firstyear outfielder for the new york yankees hit his 30th and 31st home runs of the 1920 season in the second game of a doubleheader at the polo grounds so what so george herman babe ruth became the first to hit 30 home runs in a season in the next several weeks he would also become the first to hit 40 and 50 home runs too he was on his way to a home run record that in 1920 was almost beyond belief he would hit 54 then 59 in 1921 reference points when ruth hit 54 in 1920 the secondhighest total in baseball that year was 19 by george sisler only one other team in the american league that year hit more than 44 home runs when he hit his 30th homer that afternoon it was the 138th of ruths career making him at 25 the alltime home run leader many baseball historians claim today that ruths 1920 and 21 seasons were the greatest consecutive seasons by any hitter in baseball history and many even believe either season was superior to his more famous 1927 season ruth played in only 142 games in 1920 yet drove in 137 runs his home run percentage that season was 118 compared to 1927 when it was 111 as he hit 60 in 151 games but most impressive of all ruths slugging percentages in 1920 and 21 were 847 and 846 neither figure has ever been approached in fact a slugging percentage higher than 704 has been achieved only 20 times eight by ruth ruth has the three highest slugging percentages ever his 772 mark for 1927 is no 3 no 4 is lou gehrigs 765 in 1927 ruth and gehrig are on the top20 list 11 times the most recent player to make the top 20 was ted williams who hit 731 in 1957 to rank 12th ruth joined the yankees after the 1919 season when boston sold him to new york in his last red sox season playing in 130 games ruth was 95 as a pitcher and hit 29 home runs then a record and drove in 114 runs as an outfielder before 1920 no 20thcentury player had ever hit 30 40 or 50 homers in a season only three had ever hit 20 and one was ruth three late19th century players hit between 20 and 27 home runs but some of those it is believed were insidethepark homers many coming in fenceless ballparks so in 1920 no one had ever seen this kind of home run production as recently as 1918 ruth coled the major leagues with 11 home runs and people paid plenty to see home runs in bunches the yankees who after two more seasons would be able to afford to build a new ballpark yankee stadium aka the house that ruth built became the first team to draw 1 million fans in a season in 1920 they drew 1289422 breaking the previous attendance mark by 380000 comparison of the early years year g ab h 2b 3b hr r rbi bb avg 1920 142 458 172 36 9 54 158 137 148 376 1921 152 540 204 44 16 59 177 171 144 378 1927 151 540 192 29 8 60 158 164 138 356
