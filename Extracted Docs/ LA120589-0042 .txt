A day after she became the first transplant patient to receive a heart , liver and kidney , physicians attending Cindy Martin at Presbyterian-University Hospital in Pittsburgh , Pa. , said she may be able to go home in three to four weeks . Martin , 26 , was in critical condition under intensive care after the 21 1/2-hour operation . Dr. John Armitage , who performed the heart transplant surgery , said : `` Right now , her organ function looks encouraging . She 's awake and writing us notes . '' The doctors said they planned to begin weaning her from a respirator , and that post-surgical infection would pose the greatest risk to her recovery . Although multiple-organ transplants have been done before , this was the first involving the heart , liver and a kidney , Armitage said .
