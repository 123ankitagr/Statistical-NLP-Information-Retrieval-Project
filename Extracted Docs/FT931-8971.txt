the chinese government has complained to japan over the arrival in tokyo yesterday of chien fu the first taiwanese foreign minister to visit in two decades mr chien has arrived on a tourist visa for a fourday private visit but beijing has taken his presence as an unwelcome sign of a growing taiwanese diplomatic profile china is concerned that several countries have recently appointed senior diplomats to head unofficial missions in taipei the taiwanese capital at the same time as the islands independence movement is gathering momentum while mr chien is not scheduled formally to meet japanese government officials he is likely to meet senior officials of the ruling liberal democratic party at a parliamentarians function this evening a japanese government official said chinas foreign ministry lodged a protest with the embassy in beijing noting that the issuing of any visa to mr chien is a de facto recognition of his role as foreign minister the nationalist chinese government in taiwan still claims to be the legitimate chinese government which makes mr chien the chinese foreign minister however beijing regards taiwan as a rebel province and opposes any foreign recognition of the islands government we knew that mr chiens visit was a sensitive matter for china but we have explained to them that this is a private matter and that he is here as a tourist we are not surprised that they have complained a foreign ministry official said last night the visit by mr chien is the first by a taiwanese foreign minister since 1972 when japan recognised the government in beijing and severed links with taipei instead of an embassy taiwan maintains an economic and cultural representative office in tokyo
