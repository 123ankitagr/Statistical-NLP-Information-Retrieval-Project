The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted Tuesday to provide the California Highway Patrol with radar equipment to clock traffic along two busy streets in the Santa Clarita Valley and Las Virgenes area . The CHP will use the radar along San Francisquito Canyon Road from the boundary of the city of Santa Clarita to Elizabeth Lake Road . In the Las Virgenes area , the radar will be used along Las Virgenes Road from Thousand Oaks Boulevard to Piuma Road and on Malibu Canyon Road from Piuma Road to the Pacific Coast Highway .
