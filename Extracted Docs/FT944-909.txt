Burma 's military dictatorship seems likely to kep Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , the Nobel Peace Prize winner and leader of the Burmese democracy movement , under house arrest for several more years , it was revealed yesterday . There has been speculation that Ms Aung San Suu Kyi , whose family home has been her prison for nearly 6 1/2 years , would be released on January 20 when her current detention order was thought to expire . However the Burmese foreign minister , U Ohn Gyaw , in a written reply to Mr Yozo Yokata , the special rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Burma , explained that a 'central body ' composed of the interior , foreign and defence ministers can detain anyone for up to five years . This creates a new legal justification within Burma for the detention , and reinforces a long-standing view in the diplomatic community that the military will only release the popular daughter of the country 's independence hero Aung San when it feels they can cope with her potent political appeal . Hopes for her release had been lifted after she met the powerful intelligence chief , Lt Gen Khin Nyunt , and other leaders of the State Law and Order Restoration Council twice , in September and October .
