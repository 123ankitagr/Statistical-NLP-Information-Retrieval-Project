on the day in june that sherry scott of mission viejo got her breast cancer diagnosis she telephoned kate her friend in texas her very first response was that there was a person she wanted me to see scott said the person was jan fisher a former intensivecare unit nurse who operates a private healing practice in laguna niguel in which she uses crystal healing channeling and meditation although large segments of the public sneer at such things as the alleged healing power of crystals scott has become convinced that fisher has done wonders for her mind and body nobody can tell me its woowoo because its not scott said as a result scott 52 and a selfdescribed old iowa conservative has joined the ranks of the socalled new age a movement rooted in eastern theology but crossfertilized by philosophy psychology and the arts have you ever had intuition where you know something to be true scott said this was the feeling i had i had talked to my friend about jan but i never had a personal need to go talk to her so i took a week to think about it the more i thought about it the more i thought her cancer is happening for a reason i said im an intelligent person im going to go and talk to her and see whats going on in the nottoodistant past new age was most often associated with the occult conjuring up notions of swamis gypsies and crystal balls now with actress shirley maclaine publishing books about past lives and inspiring a network tv miniseries with nancy reagan revealing her interest in astrology with national public radio broadcasting a christmas story about a wizard searching for a magic crystal and with the music industry offering grammys for new age music the movements credibility appears to be rising because the movement has no formal organization or household names as its leaders charting its public popularity is difficult but while los angeles dominates the new age scene in southern california orange county people can also find an ample menu of new age items to sample for example they can go to any of a dozen or more bookstores from yorba linda to costa mesa to a church in irvine to a channeling class in newport beach or to a pastlife workshop in huntington beach orange county resources a trimonthly huntington beach publication that has tripled its number of pages in 5 years lists dozens of new age events or seminars the 160page southern california new age telephone book lists nearly 240 categories of products or services the national new age yellow pages is published in fullerton and identifies itself as the complete directory of consciousnessraising services products and organizations but not all the new age vibrations in the county are good linda mcnamar is the assistant minister at the church of religious science in huntington beach which claims a 3000member congregation i was comfortable calling myself a new age person years ago and im not comfortable calling myself a new age person now because of the misunderstanding that might occur in some peoples thinking about what i believe and how i live my life she said for example the church does not believe in putting power in outside forces such as crystals or channels in which people act as conduits for others to unseen spiritual contacts like mcnamar others have edged away from linking themselves completely to new age thought the helix center in el toro is often mentioned by new agers as one of the focal points of new age activity in the county in the last year however new executive director leonard cohn has shied away from overtly trumpeting the bookstore as a new age center although it identifies some of its materials as new age instead he identified the center as a creative education center and bookstore because he said under the previous management the center was never a financial success they always ran a deficit in addition he said the lectures seminars and other programs offered to the public suffered from waning attendance none of the more established new age merchants described orange county as a hotbed of activity but many believe that the publics willingness to consider new age practices is growing marcia ingenito is editor and publisher of the national new age yellow pages a 250page combination of telephone directory and new age resource book orange county tends to be very conservative and new age was underground for a very very long time she said what makes it quite a wonderful place to be if youre interested in new age is that people are coming out of the woodwork because theyre no longer afraid of being criticized they recognize their own strength and they believe in what theyre doing ingenito said that most of the new age merchants now advertising have been around for 10 years or more but that stereotypes of the movement that it is satanic or cultish kept retailers from seeking mainstream recognition in its most encompassing terms the new age movement is a continuation of the consciousnessraising that surfaced in the 1960s it is as old as eastern religions and as new as the poppsyche trends of the 1960s and 70s devotees tend to believe that there are vast untapped resources of energy and awareness within the human mind that if pursued can lead to personal betterment it butts heads with western religion because most new agers believe that traditional judeochristian theology is but one source of a persons search for truth but not all new age exponents subscribe to all the movements practices with many of the most committed believers warning about false prophets in the new age camp it is a largely laissez faire movement probably because it is so diverse and personalized in its approach it doesnt have the fervor of organized religions because there is no credo indeed it incorporates ideas as mundane as meditation and vegetarianism to things as otherworldly as belief in pastlife experiences and reincarnation channeling getting in touch with mystic spirit guides and personal energy fields many aspects seem little more than harmless oddities and have entered the mainstream consciousness as evidenced by the selling of crystals at major department stores or greeting card shops but with so many seemingly harmless oddities to it the new age movement has stirred some fervent opposition robert burrows is editor of the spiritual counterfeits project newsletter published by a berkeleybased organization that opposes the new age movement because of its conflicts with traditional judeochristian religion he said new age used to be assigned to the fringe part of society but the interesting development now with new age is that it no longer is on the fringe its really mainstream despite the seemingly harmless aspects that might accompany new age thought it is basically a spiritual movement burrows said it speaks to the profound alienation that people experience in this culture but it does nothing to relieve it it actually exaggerates it and gives it religious justification as such new age may not seem as threatening to mainstream america as have other spiritualbased movements indeed new age music unlike the headbanging that traditionalists have come to associate with the latest sound is in fact a dreamy instrumental style that some find soothing and others find narcoleptic new agers burrows said believe that humanity shares divineness with a deified creation humanity has all the wisdom and power of the deity the basic appeal is power thats a particularly reassuring message in a society where people feel profoundly impotent writing in equipping the saints an evangelical christian magazine published in anaheim author douglas groothuis describes the new age movement as a smorgasbord of spiritual substitutes for christianity all heralding our unlimited potential to transform ourselves and the planet so that a new age of peace light and love will break forth groothuis encouraged practicing christians to pray for new agers and against the new age movement new agers tend to be more passive toward christians thats because they view christs teachings as but one source of information but not one to debase but most concurred with the view that new age offers a refuge for those unsatisfied with traditional religions caren croxen has a marriage and family counseling practice in fountain valley and is a new age exponent she will apply her new age beliefs if people ask her about it i think weve gone well beyond a particular sector like hippies being interested in it she said i notice in my everyday counseling i work with some very straight people theyll talk about the power of the mind to keep us well or happy theyll talk about having lived before and reincarnation and that they expect to live again these are topics people never brought up before in regular sessions betty easley activities coordinator of the psynetics foundation in anaheim which offers a wide range of new age activities and programs said new age thinking is less stigmatic today because more and more people have experienced such things as psychic phenomena the foundation opened in 1962 as a lecture group new age thinking is more accepted now because its come out of the back rooms easley said only those who are very narrowminded would call it the work of the devil other new agers are more dubious about how widespread the movement has become brian enright who publishes orange county resources from his huntington beach apartment said he thinks the people who were attracted to the consciousnessraising movements of the 1960s are the workhorses of the new age last year when shirley maclaine came out a lot of people jumped on the bandwagon he said crystals and channeling it was really fascinating there are still people on that level fascinated by the more dramatic aspects rather than seeing any vehicle for personal and planetary transformation i started to wince a little about the term new age because it came to mean so many fringy things so there is a media new age and there are people deeply and genuinely committed to planetary transformation despite the pizazz of things such as channeling enright said his publications most successful issue was devoted to vegetarianism he began his magazine in 1984 and it has peaked at 40000 copies distributed free at various outlets new age thinking is more mainstream but not to a large degree enright said you can get away with wearing crystals but if you tell someone at work youre going to a channeling they look at you strangely if you tell someone youre going to an indian sweat lodge they might say hey isnt that great but when you leave theyre going to say thats weird that does not make the movements intrusion into the publics consciousness any less troubling to its opponents kevin springer editor of the evangelical christian magazine equipping the saints said he was eating lunch one day when a woman sat down next to him and began talking about the harmonic convergence in august 1987 which many considered a seminal moment in the new age i realized then it was fairly pervasive springer said the problem is that to the people who are in this it isnt a joke to them its very serious its life and death i have to admit that i used to just laugh it off slough it off but when we put this issue of the magazine together the fall 1988 issue devoted to the new age movement we realized this is a comprehensive world view they have and it needs to be taken seriously we live in a society that is so influenced by materialism and rationalism and individualism that people are looking for something new theyve rejected traditional christianity but now they have the feeling that there has to be more than just one thing theyre not just satisfied with whats left this irrational kind of involvement whether its channeling or reincarnation gives a release to people and theyre really jumping into it springer said while some christians are hysterical about new age he thinks that is overreaction i dont perceive it as being a threat to christianity i perceive it as being wrongheaded and a dangerous way of thinking about life and ones self even among supporters of the broader new age philosophies rifts have developed cohn a retired home builder who took over the helix center said he has some philosophical differences with new age they center on his belief that the answers to peoples anxieties are found within rather than from such outside sources as a channel here in orange county with our conservative population new age is of interest to a small percentage of the population cohn said new age he said represents another avenue for people to find comfort in their lives and for people who have been turned off by the traditional religions and to a little extent by the totally scientific pragmatic viewpoint and are looking to embrace or explore alternatives in terms of spirituality and healing new age appeals to them he said because it promises a connection to a higher self however he said many people became disillusioned with the movement because it promised things it could not deliver even the strongest new age devotees caution novices to be wary of those offering new age programs there can be some people who are sincere and others who are fools according to easley of the psynetics foundation they think theyre tapping into other dimensions some are and some arent skeptical talk does little to deter diehard new agers who believe that the move toward an enlightened state is a slow evolutionary process their confidence is such that rochelle muro has opened a new age bookstore in yorba linda one of the countys most conservative areas we needed one here muro said someone had to do it i know a large new age clientele is not here in north orange county it will grow in 2 or 3 years it will take a year for the shock of moving in to wear off but asked about the commercial perils of her venture she said there is more to her effort than that my purpose is to teach to educate as for scott of mission viejo she has had no recurrence of cancer in the few months since her mastectomy and is continuing to look at her condition from a new age point of view
