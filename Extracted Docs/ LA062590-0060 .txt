The bodies of an FBI agent and a Massachusetts state trooper were found Sunday in the wreckage of a small plane atop a mountain ridge in western Maine , a search and rescue official said . The missing Piper Cherokee vanished in rough weather late last Monday , but FBI agent Paul Cavanagh and Trooper Joseph Moynihan were not declared missing until Friday , said a Maine Warden Service spokesman .
