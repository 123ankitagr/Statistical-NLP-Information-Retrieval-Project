china said yesterday that it would withdraw from the korean war armistice commission in an apparent show of support for north korea in april north korea withdrew from the body that supervises the korean war truce in an attempt to persuade the us to sign a formal peace treaty ending the 195053 conflict which could eventually lead to the us removing its troops from south korea pyongyang is likely to press for the peace treaty if diplomatic relations are established with washington as part of a wider deal to end the international dispute over north koreas nuclear programme the withdrawal of north koreas closest ally is largely symbolic as the armistice commission has not met since 1991 when north korea began boycotting the meetings in protest over the appointment of a south korean officer as head of the united nations side china made its announcement following talks with mr song hokyong the north korean viceforeign minister and the first envoy from pyongyang to visit beijing since the death of president kim ilsung in july beijings action is causing concern in seoul already worried about being left out of north koreanus talks on the nuclear issue and feeling increasingly isolated from accelerated diplomatic negotiations concerning the future of the korean peninsula the chinese announcement would appear to endorse north koreas proposal for a peace treaty with the us to replace the armistice while also excluding south korea pyongyang does not recognise south korea as a party to a future peace treaty since seoul refused to sign the 1953 armistice agreement which was concluded between north korea china and usled un forces pyongyang cited these grounds for its boycott of the truce meetings meetings to supervise the armistice are now conducted on a lower level between un and north korean military officials
