China said yesterday that it would withdraw from the Korean war armistice commission , in an apparent show of support for North Korea . In April North Korea withdrew from the body that supervises the Korean war truce in an attempt to persuade the US to sign a formal peace treaty ending the 1950-53 conflict , which could eventually lead to the US removing its troops from South Korea . Pyongyang is likely to press for the peace treaty if diplomatic relations are established with Washington as part of a wider deal to end the international dispute over North Korea 's nuclear programme . The withdrawal of North Korea 's closest ally is largely symbolic as the armistice commission has not met since 1991 , when North Korea began boycotting the meetings in protest over the appointment of a South Korean officer as head of the United Nations side . China made its announcement following talks with Mr Song Ho-kyong , the North Korean vice-foreign minister and the first envoy from Pyongyang to visit Beijing since the death of President Kim Il-sung in July . Beijing 's action is causing concern in Seoul , already worried about being left out of North Korean-US talks on the nuclear issue and feeling increasingly isolated from accelerated diplomatic negotiations concerning the future of the Korean peninsula . The Chinese announcement would appear to endorse North Korea 's proposal for a peace treaty with the US to replace the armistice , while also excluding South Korea . Pyongyang does not recognise South Korea as a party to a future peace treaty since Seoul refused to sign the 1953 armistice agreement , which was concluded between North Korea , China and US-led UN forces . Pyongyang cited these grounds for its boycott of the truce meetings . Meetings to supervise the armistice are now conducted on a lower level between UN and North Korean military officials .
