North Korea yesterday refused to release a captured US army pilot until it has completed an investigation into the crash of his helicopter over its territory on Saturday . Pyongyang is expected to repatriate the pilot if it is satisfied that the incident was caused by a navigational error , as claimed by the US . This was made clear by a North Korean diplomat in a statement to the South Korean news agency Yonhap . Washington had indicated that if North Korea refused to release the pilot and the body of his co-pilot , who was killed in the helicopter crash , such intransigence could jeopardise the recent nuclear agreement reached with the US . North Korea has so far refrained from exploiting the incident for propaganda purposes . But Pyongyang has now held the pilot longer than it kept US service personnel when it shot down a US helicopter in 1977 . The bodies of the three servicemen who were killed in that incident , along with the one survivor , were returned within three days . Meanwhile , the US military has imposed fresh restrictions on helicopter flights along the demilitarised zone which separates the two Koreas , to prevent similar incidents occurring .
