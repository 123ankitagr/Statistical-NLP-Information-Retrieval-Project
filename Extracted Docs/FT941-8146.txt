FII , the shoe manufacturer which supplies Marks and Spencer , yesterday announced a drop in interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.48m to Pounds 551,000 . The fall was due to a squeeze on margins and a series of one-off costs in the science and footwear divisions . The interim dividend is maintained at 6p , as forecast in November 's profits warning . Earnings fell from 15.3p to 2.2p per share . Turnover was 2 per cent higher at Pounds 42m . Mr Monty Sumray , chairman , said that was largely due to FII 's increased share of the UK footwear market . Sales in that division rose by 8 per cent to Pounds 38m in a stagnant market , he said . Pre-tax profits in the division were affected by a Pounds 44,000 exceptional cost of recalling a defective shoe design and rationalisation charges . Profits fell by Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 1.5m . The shoe business continued to suffer from tight margins , Mr Sumray said , and there were indications that leather prices were likely to increase . On the brighter side , the recent decision by the European Union to impose quotas on Chinese shoe imports 'may help our cause , ' said Mr Sumray . The science division incurred costs of Pounds 650,000 following the cancellation of a development contract and a product recall during the first half . This resulted in a Pounds 1.2m pre-tax loss , against a profit of Pounds 200,000 last time .
