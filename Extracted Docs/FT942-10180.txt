The United Nations nuclear watchdog agency will visit communist North Korea in the next few days to resume monitoring its secretive nuclear facilities , South Korea 's foreign ministry said yesterday , Reuter reports from Seoul . A ministry spokesman said Mr Hans Blix , director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , had announced the inspection trip in a letter to North Korean Foreign Minister Kim Yong-nam , a copy of which was sent to Seoul . He said the IAEA had also invited North Korea to send a delegation to its Vienna headquarters to discuss a timetable for inspections . The announcement raises hopes that the stalinist North may be willing to compromise on its earlier refusal to allow IAEA inspectors to sample spent fuel rods . These will shortly be removed from a nuclear reactor at Yongbyon north of Pyongyang . The IAEA said last week it would not send an inspection team to North Korea until Pyongyang allowed experts to carry out full tests on the spent nuclear fuel , to see if any has been diverted for a covert nuclear weapons programme .
