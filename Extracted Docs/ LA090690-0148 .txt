The 1990 South Bay high school football season opens tonight when Rolling Hills High plays Mary Star at 7:30 at Daniels Field in San Pedro . Rolling Hills senior quarterback Bill DeMucci , who started the 1989 season opener , will try to keep the job longer this time around . DeMucci was injured in practice after the Titans ' fourth game and replaced by Greg Schwartz , who finished the 6-3-1 season . The Titans , coached by Gary Kimbrell , feature highly touted running back with Robert Coulter , who was ranked 15th in state rushing last season with 1,545 yards . He averaged 7.6 yards per carry . Only two returning players in the state had more yards than Coulter , who presents a big challenge for the Mary Star defense . The Stars are led by four two-way veterans who earned All-Santa Fe League honors as juniors : tight end-defensive lineman Brian Bologna , wide receiver-defensive back J. R. Javier , lineman Mark Ponce De Leon and running back-defensive back Matt Redlew . The strength of Coach Mike Marinkovich 's team is its secondary . Javier , Redlew and David Bozanich combined for 21 interceptions last season , helping Mary Star to a 7-4 record . Twelve of Mary Star 's 24 players are seniors . Several of the players have competed together since elementary school DAVID RAATZ
