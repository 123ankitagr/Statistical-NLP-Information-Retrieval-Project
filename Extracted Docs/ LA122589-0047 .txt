years after it first grabbed headlines and became a popular talkshow subject chronic fatigue syndrome continues to raise more questions than it answers is it a new mediamade illness or is it 100 years old is it common or rare in the search for its underpinnings is medical technology on a witch hunt or is science closing in on a complex crippler medical researchers at the university of connecticut claim to have largely answered those questions and helped scores of cfs sufferers recover their finding chronic fatigue syndrome formerly known as chronic epsteinbarr virus syndrome is rare if it exists at all most of the patientreported symptoms attributed to the syndrome exhaustion fever swollen glands disturbed sleep and fogged thinking all occurring or recurring for months or years on end are the result of treatable psychiatric disorders particularly depression far from settling the matter their reports and those by others with similar findings have further fueled a heated debate to say this is psychological is bull snaps dr james jones a senior staff member at the national jewish center for immunology and respiratory medicine in denver he says he has seen nearly 2000 people suffering from cfs jones has coauthored the cfs working case definition arrived at in march 1988 after elevated antibodies in response to the epsteinbarr virus proved to be a false lead in the hunt for a cause and an agreedupon diagnosis some researchers argue that cfs sufferers first become physically sick from an asyetunidentified virus that causes chronic flulike symptoms depression is a common symptom of cfs they say others such as the university of connecticut researchers say people with cfs symptoms start with a history of recurrent mental illness including depression panic attacks and other disorders their physical symptoms then emerge from patients unspoken psychoemotional conflicts both sides in the cfs debate agree that most people who go to doctors complaining of persistent tiredness are probably suffering from a treatable mental illness such as depression both sides also agree that cfs or the illness that people are now calling cfs is probably not a new disease reports of a similar plaguing fatigue then labeled neurasthenia first emerged in the united states in the mid1800s notes dr peter manu lead author of the studies by the university of connecticut researchers similar symptoms have since been attributed to iceland disease chronic brucellosis and in england benign myalgic encephalomyelitis he says but here the two sides of the debate part company manu says that neurasthenia still a common diagnosis in other countries gave way to psychiatric diagnoses in the 20thcentury united states he thinks it was wrongly revived as cfs in america in the 1980s in january 1985 two articles in the annals of internal medicine reported that patients suffering from chronic fatigue showed a persistent infection from the epsteinbarr virus as measured by certain antibody levels in their blood in some people the epsteinbarr virus causes mononucleosis with its weeks or months of fevers swollen glands and exhaustion subsequently however doctors found that some healthy people were walking around with the same antibody levels as those people chronically fatigued morever many people suffering from what seemed like chronic mononucleosis did not show high antibody levels but by then it was too late manu says patients were rushing to doctors newspaper clippings in hand seeking a physical diagnosis for an illness that was probably psychological in manus view doctors were too pressed for time to do the extensive interviews necessary to make a psychiatric diagnosis or perhaps they were uncomfortable broaching the idea of mental illness with patients since testing for certain epsteinbarr antibodies had recently become commercially available doctors were able to give patients the technological fix they sought although those antibody counts proved imprecise and largely irrelevant in this age of aids both medical and popular thought focused on a viral cause for chronic fatigue here you had millions of people that for about two years 1986 to 1987 believed they had chronic epsteinbarr virus and all of a sudden that was taken away from them manu says the evidence is that cfs need not be produced by a virus but is associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders says manu who says he has seen 200 patients with the syndromes symptoms since he and two other doctors set up the university of connecticuts chronic fatigue clinic in late 1986 not everyone agrees that people catch cfs from magazine articles i think the kneejerk reaction is to call anything that we dont understand or that we cant prove is organic by the definition of the day or the technology of the day psychiatric and i dont think thats right dr paul cheney says as a senior staff physician at the nolle clinic in charlotte nc cheney says he has seen 1000 patients with chronic fatigue in the past three years he is following 500 people from that group analyzing them over time for immune system and neurological abnormalities they have enough objective abnormalities that they could not manufacture through psychic means cheney says of the majority of those patients and he adds between the years 1980 and 1984 the only thing we could find in aids patients was disturbed immune function and a menagerie of other infections that didnt make any sense both cheney and dr anthony komaroff chief of general medicine at brigham and womens hospital in boston say they will soon publish studies showing immune system dysfunction in cfs patients measurable immune system abnormalities which cheney says have been reported in other countries medical journals could provide a more clearcut and readily accepted diagnosis but cheney concedes there isnt a single test within this immunologic profile that we do that is always abnormal in cfs patients
