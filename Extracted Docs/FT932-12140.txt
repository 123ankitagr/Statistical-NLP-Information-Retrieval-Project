DENTSU , the world 's largest advertising agency , is creating the post of executive chairman and reshuffling top management , the company said . Mr Yutaka Narita , executive director , is being promoted to president while Mr Gohei Kogure , president , will assume the newly created post of executive chairman . The move is aimed at creating a management structure that better reflects the company 's size and responsibilities as a leading corporation , a Dentsu representative said . The announcement came as Dentsu was named by Advertising Age , a trade magazine , as the world 's largest advertising agency by gross income for the 20th consecutive year . This was despite Japan experiencing the first negative growth in advertising expenditure since 1965 . Last year Japan saw a 4.6 per cent fall in advertising expenditure to Y5,461bn ( Dollars 49bn ) , which took it back to the level of expenditure in 1990 . The country saw the first recorded decrease in television advertising revenue while newspaper advertising fell by 9.5 per cent . Dentsu last year reported a slight fall in sales to Y1,362bn and a 1 per cent decline in gross profit to Y197bn .
