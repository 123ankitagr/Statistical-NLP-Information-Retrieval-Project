The Rev . Jesse Jackson said Saturday that a pattern of discrediting black elected officials is developing in the United States , similar to one that drove blacks from office following Reconstruction . `` I would n't say it 's a conspiracy , but one can at least see a pattern here . Not one of these people has been convicted , but they keep investigating , '' the civil rights leader said at a prayer breakfast sponsored by embattled Rep. Harold E. Ford ( D-Tenn. ) . The two-time Democratic presidential candidate centered his remarks around Ford , who is running for a ninth term but still faces political corruption charges that were first filed in 1987 . Ford 's first trial ended in a mistrial April 27 after a jury could not reach a verdict . Prosecutors said they plan to retry the case . `` Why does this Harold Ford trial take on such national importance ? Because there is a sense of history , not hysteria . We remember what happened in the last century , '' Jackson said . `` Ten years after slavery ended , the numbers of black officials were growing rapidly , '' he said . `` But then the group of people who says we are only a little higher than animals and a little lower than people started their campaign to disrupt , discredit and destroy our leadership . It did not take very much to re-instill fear in whites . '' Jackson cited probes of Rep. William H. Gray III ( D-Pa. ) , Rep. Ronald V. Dellums ( D-Berkeley ) and Rep. Gus Savage ( D-Ill. ) , which he said were fruitless . `` There have been all these discrediting leaks and investigations , and not one conviction . But there has been just enough suggestion , and the power of suggestion has power , '' he said . Unlike the others , Jackson said Ford has been indicted and tried . `` In a jury of his peers , 9 of 12 exonerated him . But losing 9-3 is not enough for the government . They say : 'He is our trophy . We can not stop because he is our trophy , ' `` Jackson said in urging the government not to retry Ford .
