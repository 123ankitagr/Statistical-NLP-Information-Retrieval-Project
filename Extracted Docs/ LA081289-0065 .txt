Kim Hughes , the Fallbrook woman who waited more than five months on a donor organ list for a new liver , was listed in critical but stable condition at UCLA Medical Center Friday after transplant surgery . The complicated , 11 1/2-hour liver transplant concluded about 5 a.m. and seemed to go well , hospital spokesman Mike Byrne said . Ronald W. Busuttil , director of the UCLA liver transplant program , performed the operation that involved removing Hughes ' liver , pancreas and part of her stomach before putting in the new liver . Hughes , 21 , was diagnosed with cancer in 1986 . A rare , slow-growing tumor in her pancreas invaded the liver , and in February she was placed on a donor waiting list for a liver . Surgeons did not replace Hughes ' pancreas , Byrne said . Unless it is replaced later , Hughes will be dependent on medication for the rest of her life . Doctors are closely monitoring Hughes for signs of rejection and infection , Byrne said . Hughes could be out of the hospital in six weeks .
