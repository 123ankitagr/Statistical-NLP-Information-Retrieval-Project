ABC 's `` Funniest Home Videos '' was the top show of last week , but CBS won the Sunday night on which it aired and NBC took the week as usual , it was reported today . `` It 's rather strange , '' said Sari DeCesare , NBC manager of audience research . `` What 's happened is that ABC has an isolated show . '' `` Home Videos '' was up there alone in the numbers . The show that preceded it , `` Life Goes On , '' tied for 65th place with an 8.8 rating and a 15 share . `` Home Videos '' was No . 1 with a whopping 24.1 rating and a 37 share -- up an incredible 22 share points . Then along came `` Elvis , '' tied for 47th with an 11.1 rating and a 17 share . Where did all the viewers go ? To `` The Simpsons '' on Fox , which airs in the subsequent half-hour and won its time period for the first time ever . It was in 20th place with a 15.1 rating and a 23 share . All this has put `` Murder , She Wrote '' in 29th place , knocking it out of its accustomed spot as time period winner -- but that has not knocked CBS out of first place on Sunday . One reason is `` 60 Minutes , '' which is in its second week with Andy Rooney back . It came in sixth with a 19.6 rating and a 34 share , about the show 's average before the Rooney fracas . That 's not as good as the previous week , when Rooney 's return boosted the show to fourth place with a 22 rating and a 37 share . NBC won the Sunday movie contest with `` Perry Mason : The Case of the Desperate Deception , '' which came in 13th . On CBS `` The People 's Choice Awards '' tied for 22nd , earning a 14.9 rating and a 24 share , way down from last year when it had a 19.6 rating and a 31 share . ABC 's repeat of `` The Women of Brewster Place , '' Part 1 , tied for 62nd place . NBC won the ratings race for the week for the 21st consecutive time , and 89th out of the last 90 weeks . The network took the week ending March 11 with a 13.5 rating and a 22 share , according to the A. C. Nielsen Co. ABC was back in second place with an 12.2 rating and a 20 share , while CBS was third with an 11.0 rating and an 18 share . The 25-week-old season-to-date ratings show NBC with a 14.8 rating and a 24 share , ABC with a 13.0 rating and a 21 share , and CBS with a 12.3 rating and a 20 share .
