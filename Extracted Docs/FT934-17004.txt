THE GOVERNMENT will set out ways of improving protection for wildlife in a consultation paper on the European directive on wildlife habitats , to be published on Monday . Under the directive , the UK must establish a network of protected wildlife sites across the country . The directive aims to compile an international network , called Natura 2000 , of important sites . The government must incorporate the directive into legislation by June next year , and must draw up the list of selected sites by June 1995 . Officials are basing the list on the existing list of more than 5,700 Sites of Special Scientific Interest . However , only the sites richest in wildlife are likely to be chosen . The list may also include some estuaries and shorelines , which do not qualify for SSSI protection . This extends only to the high-water level of waterways and coastlines . Mr Simon Forrester , of the Worldwide Fund for Nature , said yesterday : 'It is now clear there will be no new legislation - they will just be tinkering with the existing Countryside and Wildlife Acts , and they will be relying on voluntary compliance .
