TEXAS Instruments announced a fast new microprocessor to be used in a new range of Sun Microsystems workstations which are expected to be introduced later this month . The Supersparc chip will give Sun workstations a much needed performance boost . The workstation market leader has been facing increased competition from Hewlett-Packard and International Business Machines workstations that outpace Sun 's current products . The Texas Instruments chip , the first of a series of microprocessors that are being jointly developed with Sun Microsystems , will also be used in new mid-range computers planned by ICL of the UK . Texas Instruments will also offer the chip to other computer manufacturers . With its announcement yesterday , Texas Instruments has beaten rival Cypress Semiconductor to the punch . Next week Cypress and Sun Microsystems are expected to announce an even faster version of the Sparc microprocessor , although volume manufacturing of the Cypress chip is believed to be several months away .
