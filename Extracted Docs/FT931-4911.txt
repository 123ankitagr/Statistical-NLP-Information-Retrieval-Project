has recession taken the pressure off central londons creaking public transport system try asking commuters on the central line london undergrounds main eastwest link across the capital even at todays reduced passenger levels peakhour loadings are 45 per cent above the levels for which the line was designed yet the treasury is now questioning the need for the planned pounds 2bn crossrail scheme a new eastwest rail line due to open around the turn of the century crossrail would bring big benefits to central london by providing a link between british rails liverpool street and paddington stations it would enable suburban trains to run straight through central london stopping at stations in the west end and the city on the way many commuters could then reach their destinations without changing to the underground so saving time and reducing pressure on the central line questioning such a project looks perverse at a time when london underground is poised to embark on a pounds 18bn extension of the jubilee line to the docklands development area like crossrail the jubilee line extension was approved before recession set in at the time costbenefit analyses of the two projects yielded similar results since then the outlook for employment growth in docklands and hence demand for transport has deteriorated much more than it has in central london yet it is the financially stronger case for crossrail that has now come under treasury scrutiny there is an argument for pressing ahead with the jubilee line extension for the regenerative effect it would have on docklands but certainly not if it is at the expense of providing central london with an acceptable transport system while money is being ploughed into transport for docklands pounds 18bn for the jubilee line pounds 165bn for roads and pounds 800m for an expansion of the docklands light railway central london has seen the pounds 750mayear capital spending budget for its transport system cut by a third and crossrail is now the only significant transport project on the horizon docklands is not the only part of london that needs good transport central london needs it too if the government can not see this it can only be because it regards one of the capitals withered extremities as more important than its overall economic health
