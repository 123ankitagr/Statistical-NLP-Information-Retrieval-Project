it is up near the top lefthand corner tucked between the borders of montana idaho and the canadian province of alberta modern travel being what it is however you can fly from new york to whitefish in just a few hours via salt lake city to kalispell airport a few miles away is whitefish a small place population 4500 with no big hotels a few shops and a handful of bars the nightlife is limited but pursued with enthusiasm particularly at the world famous kickass palace bar home to local heavy metal bands and midnight mouse racing although you might not notice it at first whitefish is also a ski town which is why i was there about 20 minutes drive from downtown whitefish is the ski resort of big mountain like whitefish big mountain is a determinedly unglamorous place a cluster of small functional buildings sits at the base of uncrowded pistes below an unobtrusive collection of houses and lodges is hidden within the treeline there is not a marriott or a ritzcarlton in sight and the car park is packed with pickups and beatenup saloons again like the town and the resort centre the mountain itself does not look much at first but first appearances can deceive big mountain boasts a 2400ft vertical drop 56 trails and six main chairlifts an averagesized resort by north american standards yet off the marked trails it has hundreds of acres of skiing among fir trees many bent into bizarre shapes by the weight of the frost creating the regions trademark snow ghosts along gullies through glades down chutes and into the basins of small bowls the front face of the mountain offers a variety of comfortable green and blue runs and the occasional challenging black each day i started with an intermediate trail called inspiration a fast descent down the mountain that takes in views of whitefish lake and the agricultural lands of the flathead valley later in the week those views were obscured by clouds which lap at the feet of the mountains like waves in a thick cotton sea clouds are common on big mountain but then so is snow although there was no powder the week i was there the north face of the mountain where the slopes escape the freezethaw cycle offered a fresh supply of light powdery snow that keeps its condition throughout each day here steeply pitched mogul runs like the intimidating bighorn challenge both technique and courage what big mountain may lack in size it more than makes up for in extras such as snowcat skiing for dollars 35 pounds 2340 a snow tractor will take you into the back country in search of powder and night skiing the latter is especially thrilling on my first day i skied late into the afternoon then continued under the floodlights in the cooling night air i finished just as the mountain was closing by skipping off the main run to end the evening alone on shadowy slopes lit only by a threequarter moon each day or night always ends at big mountains favourite slopeside haunt the hell roaring saloon the hell roaring is an apresski bar from the days before they called them apresski bars crowded with skiers locals and mountain workers it is woodpanelled comfortable and noisy the hell roaring is also home to the most unusual special offer in mountain retailing buy a hell roaring saloon cap for dollars 15 and you are entitled to one free draught beer every day for the rest of your life cap on head pint in hand i quickly worked out that at two bucks a beer i needed to stay at least seven days to make a profit on the deal if ever there was an incentive to stay in montana skiing and drinking beer this was it
