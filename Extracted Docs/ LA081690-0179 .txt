Volkswagen of America Inc. plans to open its first American auto design center in Simi Valley , a VW spokesman said Wednesday . Pat Fitzgerald , a spokesman at the company 's headquarters in Troy , Mich. , said the company already has signed a lease for property in the Simi Valley Business Center on the city 's west side . But he declined further comment , saying details were being withheld until a formal announcement Monday . The company , a unit of Volkswagen AG of West Germany , would join General Motors Corp. and major Japanese auto makers such as Toyota and Honda in establishing design centers in California . Another West German car maker , Mercedes-Benz , has also announced plans to open a design facility in the state . `` Most industries believe that California is a trend-setting market '' and therefore `` a good place to sit back and watch just what 's happening in the marketplace , '' said Chris Cedergren , an analyst with the auto marketing research firm of J. D. Power & Associates in Agoura Hills . VW 's U.S. sales this year are flat . The company sold 80,200 vehicles through July this year , compared to 80,344 a year ago , according to J. D. Power . VW 's Audi division sold 12,645 vehicles through July , up slightly from 11,970 a year earlier .
