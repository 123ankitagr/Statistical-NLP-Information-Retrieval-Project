Jurors in the trial of a Latino police officer charged with killing two black men in a Miami shooting that set off three days of racial rioting saw a videotape of blacks pelting crime scene detectives with rocks and bottles . `` It was bedlam , '' testified crime scene technician Rafael Garcia , who was hurt the night of Jan. 16 by flying debris . Garcia , a prosecution witness in the trial of Officer William Lozano , 31 , told defense lawyer Mark Seiden that much of the physical evidence in the case was abandoned because of the violence . Garcia , testifying during the second day of testimony , did not say whether evidence that was never retrieved by police would have been beneficial to either side .
