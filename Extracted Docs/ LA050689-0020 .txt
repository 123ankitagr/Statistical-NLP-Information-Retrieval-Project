I cringed when I read director Oliver Stone 's heartless retort to victims of communist repression : `` When are you going to find the love in your heart to forgive and move on ? '' ( `` Vietnamese-U.S. Film Symposium Stirs Passions , '' by Daniel Cerone , April 29 ) . I 'm glad Stone was n't making films in the 1940s . Would he have met with Goebbels at a `` Nazi-U.S. film symposium '' and told victims of the Nazi genocide , `` You 're not the only people in the world that have experienced suffering '' ? While film makers sent by communist regimes propagandize freely here , their own people live hellish lives . Apparently , their situations are not worthy of trendy Hollywood film making .
