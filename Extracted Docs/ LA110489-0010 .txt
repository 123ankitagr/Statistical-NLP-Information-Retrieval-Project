i read that ronald reagan wants to return decency and morality to u s movies and that he thinks japanese movies are better than ours isn't it interesting that he of all people would talk about decency and morality isn't he the one who robbed the poor to cut taxes for the rich who created a nation of homeless by cutting housing money by 90 who reduced food programs and left us with 20 million hungry who said homeless people like to sleep on grates in freezing weather who forced the minimum wage to remain 3.35 all during his reign who created a national debt and deficits so huge that we americans must pay 600 million in interest alone every day much of which goes to japan who made it possible for cronies to milk hud for millions and who year after year poured billions into military expenditures while proclaiming that human needs problems can't be solved by throwing money at them who kept 30 of our best engineers tied up producing military equipment so we couldn't compete in world markets and who made sure that japan always had the better deal on trade you mean he's the one talking about decency and morality you're kidding after getting 2 million from japan for his appearance there and for all he did for them in washington he should star in a new movie called mr greed goes to tokyo think of the message on morality and decency our children would receive instead of milking the ex-presidency to the extent no other president has done why doesn't he just look at the want ads and get a respectable job that's what he always advised everyone else who was unemployed jack f miller tustin
