missing lines in sylvie drakes monday review of once in arden at south coast repertory some lines were omitted writing of the predicament faced by the protagonist helena modjeska as to whether to appear in vaudeville drake wrote does she or doesnt she in the end for all the talk we never quite find out so once in ardens only big decision is never adequately explored the play lacks tensile strength everything in it is too soft and predictable hellesen writes around his subject rather than to it endlessly circling his prey but never coming in for the kill
