a former lloyd's underwriter who worked for the gooda walker agency came under pressure to mislead names about the extent of losses suffered by his syndicate in the late 1980 s he told the high court in london yesterday mr anthony willard an underwriter on the gooda walker syndicate 299, which lost heavily after the piper alpha oil rig disaster said he was told to rewrite a letter to exaggerate the wealth of the syndicate in the wake of the explosion the evidence emerged during a highly emotional and strained cross-examination of mr willard in the high court action brought by 3,095 lossmaking gooda walker names the individuals whose assets have traditionally supported the lloyd's insurance market mr willard told the court that in 1989 mr anthony gooda the agency's former chairman rejected his first letter as too pessimistic he wanted me to write a more optimistic letter it does not have to be the truth the accusation was one of a series made by mr willard against mr gooda and mr derek walker the agency's former leading underwriter he accused mr walker of a lot of interference in the business of syndicate 299, which specialised in marine insurance he said mr walker encouraged him to take on inappropriate time and distance policies these are reinsurance policies allowing syndicates to manage reserves against long-tail' claims which come many years after the start of policies he attempted to get me to write risks that i did not consider to be a valid marine risk mr willard said on one occasion mr walker and another broker mr andrew goodyear wanted him to write reinsurance for the non-marine syndicate 164 which was thought to be in danger of going through the top i think it was derek walker who said that is no problem we have a tame company they would write it they could disguise it as marine and you could write it mr willard said he had replied that the auditors would have to be informed but mr walker had then responded surely tony you do not tell your auditors everything do you mr willard refused to write the business and told mr gooda at the end of the meeting i do not think this firm can stand my honesty any more he told the court he had come under considerable stick from fellow directors who suggested that instead of telling the truth i should be keeping quiet putting my head down and writing more business mr willard said he was brought up a long time ago to act in the utmost good faith that went out the window at lloyd's some time ago he told the court
