In an effort to cut worsening street traffic and air quality in the Los Angeles area , County Supervisor Mike Antonovich on Tuesday proposed a series of measures aimed at getting large trucks off the road at rush hour . Antonovich proposed banning truck deliveries to all 1,900 county government sites and ordering the county 's own fleet of 400 trucks off the road during peak hours . Antonovich 's motion also asked for a study of the worst traffic intersections in the unincorporated areas of the county where the Board of Supervisors has jurisdiction and proposed a possible ban on all rush-hour truck traffic at those sites . The proposal follows similar plans by the City of Los Angeles .
