I walk along the Los Angeles River every day from Glendale Boulevard to Los Feliz Boulevard ; either early morning or at sunset . Over the last few years the river has become beautiful . There are all kinds of water fowl and birds living in this section of the river . It is so peaceful , and hard to believe it 's so near the Golden State Freeway . Please spend that $ 100,000 to clean up the river where thoughtless people have thrown all kinds of trash , stuck in the middle of the river . I am not alone . A lot of people enjoy their walks along this `` living '' river . MRS. VIVIAN ROCKEFELLER Los Angeles
