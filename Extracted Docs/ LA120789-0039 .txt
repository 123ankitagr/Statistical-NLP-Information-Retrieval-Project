i walk along the los angeles river every day from glendale boulevard to los feliz boulevard either early morning or at sunset over the last few years the river has become beautiful there are all kinds of water fowl and birds living in this section of the river it is so peaceful and hard to believe its so near the golden state freeway please spend that $ 100000 to clean up the river where thoughtless people have thrown all kinds of trash stuck in the middle of the river i am not alone a lot of people enjoy their walks along this living river mrs vivian rockefeller los angeles
