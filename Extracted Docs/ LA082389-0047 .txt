A federal judge denied the National Wildlife Federation 's request that the Commerce Department be ordered to enforce regulations requiring shrimpers to equip their nets with turtle excluder devices , or TEDs , to protect endangered sea turtles from drowning . Wildlife Federation attorney Robert Irvin said he would appeal the decision by U.S. District Judge Stanley Harris to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia . Five conservation groups , meanwhile , filed suit in federal court against Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher , alleging his suspension of regulations that require shrimpers to use TEDs was unlawful .
