A fugitive who was arrested after appearing on the game show `` Super Password '' filed a lawsuit in Los Angeles Wednesday in an effort to collect his $ 58,400 in winnings , plus $ 1 million in damages . In his Superior Court lawsuit , Kerry D. Ketchem says the show and its producer , Mark Goodson Productions , claim he breached the contestant 's agreement he signed before appearing on the show under the name of Patrick Quinn and have refused to pay him . Ketchem was arrested at Mark Goodson Productions on Jan. 14 , 1988 , when he arrived to pick up his winnings . An Anchorage banker had spotted Ketchem on the show and recognized him as someone suspected of spending $ 25,000 with fraudulently obtained credit cards .
