my abiding memory of marilyn horne will be of a curtain-call at covent garden a couple of years ago amid enthusiastic applause there was one man who kept booing insistently from upstairs the redoubtable miss horne marched to the front of the stage stopped the applause and defied him to come on down then having silenced him raised her fist in the air and marched off in triumph that was at a performance of rossini's la donna del lago sadly we shall not be seeing any more of marilyn horne in her famed rossini roles the royal opera's revival of l'italiana in algeri which opened on saturday is her last rossini opera on stage not just in london but anywhere for more than 30 years she has been a formidable heroine and hero in trousers in so many of this composer's operas expert at knowing how to shape his slow music exciting in the coloratura ready to fire her booming chest register like a cannon when she was roused most of those facilities are still available to her though she has to husband her resources carefully these days top notes have to be approached very gingerly and phrases that move up through the voice are apt to waver out-of-tune to the qualities outlined earlier i would add here that she has the gift of keeping the longest vocal lines going somewhere and that her exactitude of rhythm is exemplary decades of polishing each rossini semiquaver have kept them sparkling as new as the italian girl in algiers she gives a star performance with all that that implies mobility is visibly painful for her but horne's isabella keeps joy on her face resourcefulness in her spirit while mugging almost all the comic moments to excess the mustafa whom she captivates is ruggero raimondi hair slicked back long black whiskers glinting eyes plenty to remind us that a once formidable don giovanni is hiding under the turkish cloak and baggy trousers his way with the music is casual as is his wont in contrast no care was too great for bruce ford in lindoro's opening aria of love which he floated as gently as a kiss on the breeze he has become a most appealing rossini tenor alessandro corbelli repeated his amusing taddeo and carlo rizzi kept the whole ensemble firmly in hand from the pit if only the production understood wit as well as it does comedy this is the ponnelle staging which opens with a gaggle of grotesque eunuchs what is the collective noun embroidering tasselled curtains i did not recall that they return at the end sporting false red noses and silly walks but fear i shall never be able to forget it now the humour seems to have grown cruder with the years as when isabella floors mustafa with a right hook at the end of the first act or perhaps that is just in character for a rossini mezzo who has always been a knock-out incidentally i am told that the unsatisfied customer at la donna del lago did go down to marilyn horne's dressing-room afterwards to tell her to her face why he had been booing a brave man or a foolish one
