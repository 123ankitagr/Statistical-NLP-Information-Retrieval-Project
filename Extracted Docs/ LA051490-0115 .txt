Bell Helicopter Textron Inc. , whose V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft military project faces an uncertain future because of defense cuts , said today it will lay off 115 employees to `` help improve cost efficiencies . '' The work reduction action will affect both hourly and salaried workers and wo n't be concentrated in a particular program or production , a company spokesman said . The military and commercial helicopter maker employs about 7,000 people . Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has proposed to eliminate the V-22 project , one of the largest defense projects for Bell Helicopter . It is being jointly developed by Bell Helicopter Textron and Boeing Helicopters of Ridley Township , Pa . Proposed cuts in the defense budget have affected other area companies that rely heavily on such contracts .
