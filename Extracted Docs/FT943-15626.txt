Sir Michael Perry , chairman of Unilever , last night warned manufacturers of branded products against the dangers of complacency and failure to innovate , while calling for partnership , rather than confrontation , with the retailing chains . Sir Michael said successful manufacturers could 'sit back and rest on their past investment - sometimes for years ' . But he added : ' I know , we 've done it . But at some point a day of reckoning will come ' . Brands can establish a formidable reputation , said Sir Michael , but he warned that 'very few are truly inimitable over time ' . The warning , delivered at a lecture to the Advertising Association , of which Sir Michael is president , comes as 30 of the leading brand manufacturers , including Unilever , have joined together to press for legislation to curb supermarkets ' 'look-alike ' brands . It was no longer adequate for brand manufacturers to rely on their reputation for consistency of quality , he said . 'Stores like Sainsbury , Tesco and Safeway have established their own reputations as guarantors of freshness and quality - and far more than that . They have established powerful brand identities of their own . ' 'Brands only prosper - and only deserve to prosper - when they represent value to the consumer . ' The only way a brand could continue to provide value was through continuous research and development and 'getting the result to market faster ' . Sir Michael appealed to retailers for a new partnership : 'We go along to them with a simple question : 'How can we work together to maximise sales and margins across a whole product category ? '' Brand owners must at all times focus on the 'value for money ' equation , concluded Sir Michael : 'Is the balance between price and quality the right one ? '
