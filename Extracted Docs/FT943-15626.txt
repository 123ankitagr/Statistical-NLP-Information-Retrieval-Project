sir michael perry chairman of unilever last night warned manufacturers of branded products against the dangers of complacency and failure to innovate while calling for partnership rather than confrontation with the retailing chains sir michael said successful manufacturers could sit back and rest on their past investment sometimes for years but he added i know weve done it but at some point a day of reckoning will come brands can establish a formidable reputation said sir michael but he warned that very few are truly inimitable over time the warning delivered at a lecture to the advertising association of which sir michael is president comes as 30 of the leading brand manufacturers including unilever have joined together to press for legislation to curb supermarkets lookalike brands it was no longer adequate for brand manufacturers to rely on their reputation for consistency of quality he said stores like sainsbury tesco and safeway have established their own reputations as guarantors of freshness and quality and far more than that they have established powerful brand identities of their own brands only prosper and only deserve to prosper when they represent value to the consumer the only way a brand could continue to provide value was through continuous research and development and getting the result to market faster sir michael appealed to retailers for a new partnership we go along to them with a simple question how can we work together to maximise sales and margins across a whole product category brand owners must at all times focus on the value for money equation concluded sir michael is the balance between price and quality the right one
