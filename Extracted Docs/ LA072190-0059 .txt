with a heavily edited version of a key white house tape and museum displays that avoid many aspects of the scandal including the criminal convictions of several senior aides the new richard m nixon library constitutes the former presidents most recent effort in a 16year campaign to reshape the publics view of watergate library officials repeatedly had told reporters in recent days and weeks that the tapes presented at the museum would be left unedited asked friday about that library director hugh hewitt declined to comment thats a museum design question he said adding that the museum design had been supervised by nixons top aide and spokesman john taylor taylor could not be reached for comment the watergate display which nixon avoided when he gave president bush and former presidents ronald reagan and gerald r ford a tour of the museum thursday opened to the public friday it consists of three white house tapes two of which will not be available to visitors until september and a long wall of text and photographs describing the events of the watergate scandal the one tape available to the public now is the socalled smoking gun tape of july 23 1972 in which nixon approved a plan to have the cia warn the fbi to stop its investigation of watergate the library version of the tape presents only some portions of the conversation stitched together with a narration that offers innocent explanations for what nixon is heard saying the tape concludes with nixon reading a diary entry made two weeks later describing later events the text displays concede that nixon himself has said he made inexcusable misjudgments during watergate but accuse many of nixons critics ranging from the late sen sam ervin dnc who chaired the senates investigation of watergate to archibald cox the harvard law professor who served as special prosecutor until nixon fired him of partisan bias washington post reporter bob woodward and his former colleague carl bernstein are singled out for special criticism one display accuses the two who won a pulitzer prize for their reporting on watergate of offering bribes illegally gaining access to telephone numbers and talking to members of the grand jury in their efforts the display puts that accusation in quotes attributed only to an unnamed scholar the quotation is from a recent book on watergate by stanley i kutler of the university of wisconsin kutler in an interview friday said that in the book he did not make the charge himself but merely had noted that others had said it woodward in an interview friday denied ever having offered bribes as portrayed in thousands of pages of transcripts from court trials and congressional hearings hundreds of hours of taped white house conversations and depositions from scores of witnesses the scandal that became known as watergate was in fact two overlapping conspiracies the first begun early in the nixon term was a plan to use wiretaps burglaries and surveillance by the fbi the cia and independent groups organized by white house aides to harass spy on and punish the presidents enemies members of one of those independent groups known informally as the plumbers were arrested on june 17 1972 as they tried to break into the offices of democratic national chairman lawrence obrien in washingtons watergate office building before the scandal ended john d ehrlichman nixons top domestic policy adviser g gordon liddy general counsel to nixons reelection campaign and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts connected to that conspiracy the museum contains no mention of that first conspiracy or the convictions that flowed from it the second conspiracy which began almost immediately after the watergate arrests was designed to cover up the first conspiracy ehrlichman h r haldeman who was nixons chief of staff atty gen john n mitchell and eight others were found guilty of criminal acts in connection with that conspiracy nixons own participation in the coverup effort led the watergate grand jury to name him an unindicted coconspirator on feb 29 1974 and formed the basis for most of the impeachment charges that the house judiciary committee approved 27 to 11 on july 27 1974 as portrayed by the museums display the scandal that drove nixon from office is far different the way the former president has always seen it an epic and bloody political battle in which democrats sought to reverse the mandate of the 1972 election by forcing him from office visitors to the museum first hear of watergate during a 27minute film that portrays highlights of nixons career the mention is brief the president knew nothing about it a narrator says referring to the watergate breakin but the narrator continues in the months that followed some of his aides became involved in a coverup the film then leaves the subject entirely returning only to say without further explanation that threatened with impeachment nixon resigned the watergate room itself presents a carefully selected set of facts about the scandal nixon the opening display says did not pay much attention to the breakin when he first heard of it the next day that display does not mention the fact that nixon and haldeman met and discussed the breakin for 20 minutes two days later the tape of that july 20 discussion was mysteriously erased the 18 12minute gap that became one of watergates most notorious incidents according to the museum display which mentions the gap but does not explain which conversation it involved experts said the gap could easily have been caused by a mechanical malfunction but the presidents opponents wasted no time in finding sinister and devious motives in fact a team of experts appointed by us district judge john sirica reported on june 4 that the tape had been erased by hand and that malfunctioning of the recorder was conclusively eliminated as a possible cause of the erasures
