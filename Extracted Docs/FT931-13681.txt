sir brian gills depiction of londons diminishing built heritage in the dockland area was misleading in the extreme letters january 14 contrary to what he suggests when the department of the environment was invited in 1981 by the newly created docklands development corporation to survey every building in its jurisdiction no buildings of architectural or historical merit were identified on st georges wharf deptford however 115 previously overlooked buildings in the docklands area were listed adding substantially to the existing list compiled in 1973 since 1981 further research has shed light on many other buildings and artefacts which have proved to be of historic or architectural value the corporation has wasted no time in having these spotlisted on st georges wharf for instance the lddc has repaired and restored an old brick wall and parish boundary stone dating from 1819 these were spotlisted in july of last year it was not too long ago that the old dock buildings were being pulled down and the docks filled in without any regard to their potential significance in the 11 years of the corporations existence however that trend has been reversed the preservation and conservation work carried out by the lddc has ensured that londons heritage in docklands far from being destroyed is being enriched howard sheppard director city design and planning lddc thames quay 191 marsh wall london e14
