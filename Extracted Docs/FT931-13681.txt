Sir , Brian Gill 's depiction of London 's diminishing built heritage in the dockland area was misleading in the extreme ( Letters , January 14 ) . Contrary to what he suggests , when the Department of the Environment was invited in 1981 by the newly created Docklands Development Corporation to survey every building in its jurisdiction , no buildings of architectural or historical merit were identified on St George 's Wharf , Deptford . However , 115 previously overlooked buildings in the Docklands area were listed , adding substantially to the existing list compiled in 1973 . Since 1981 , further research has shed light on many other buildings and artefacts which have proved to be of historic or architectural value . The corporation has wasted no time in having these spot-listed . On St George's Wharf , for instance , the LDDC has repaired and restored an old brick wall and parish boundary stone dating from 1819 . These were spot-listed in July of last year . It was not too long ago that the old dock buildings were being pulled down and the docks filled in , without any regard to their potential significance . In the 11 years of the corporation 's existence , however , that trend has been reversed . The preservation and conservation work carried out by the LDDC has ensured that London 's heritage in docklands , far from being destroyed , is being enriched .
