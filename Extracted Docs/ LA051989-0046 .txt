As a fourth-generation Angeleno , I found Allswang 's commentary on our mayor to be another deplorable example of a non-native 's ignorantly myopic view of our all-too-complex city . Mayor Bradley has earned the respect and admiration of all Angelenos , no matter their ethnic , economic , or political backgrounds . Over the years of his tenure many have ( most often wrongly ) questioned his decisions ; the Olympics , Metro Rail , etc . However , no one in his right mind can question Bradley 's honesty . Moreover , I find it ludicrous that anyone who purports to know our city would want to see the confusion of New York or Chicago municipal politics rung down upon our lives . Los Angeles is not like any other city in the world . Its uniqueness is as difficult to define as it is to manage . Mayor Bradley more than any other mayor in this century has shown vision , courage , composure , and compassion as he has helped us all to live through our own urban evolution . No city is perfect ; Los Angeles is proof enough of that . However , if Allswang would like a ( New York City Mayor ) Ed Koch or a Daley , I suggest he return to the city or state where he might better find that type of partisan prima donna .
