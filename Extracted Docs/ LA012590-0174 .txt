exxon corp on wednesday increased its estimate of the total 1989 costs of cleaning up the massive alaskan oil spill to 2 billion and said it would take another 500-million charge in the fourth quarter to cover costs from what is now the most expensive environmental disaster in history in reporting its estimated 1989 earnings exxon said it would take a 500-million charge in the fourth quarter for costs to clean up the spill of 11 million gallons of oil that spilled from the grounded tanker exxon valdez and fouled the shoreline of pristine prince william sound last march the charges reduced exxon's 1989 net income to 3.8 billion compared to 5.26 billion in 1988 revenue totaled 96.1 billion in 1989, compared to 88.6 billion the year before on wednesday exxon spokesman william smith upped the company's estimate of the spill's total costs so far costs to exxon and others to about 2 billion the figure does not include any liability from more than 150 lawsuits exxon faces from the spill nor does it include additional cleanup costs should exxon resume work in the spring the fourth-quarter charge comes in addition to 880 million that the company already set aside in the first and second quarters bringing exxon's total cleanup costs for the year to 1.38 billion other costs will be covered by more than 400 million in insurance smith said analysts were not surprised at the additional charge though it was a lot bigger than i expected said joel d fischer an analyst with drexel burnham lambert inc in new york wall street showed little reaction to the news with exxon's stock falling only 12.5 cents to close at 47 a share the financial effect of the exxon valdez accident was clearly the major reason for lower net income in 1989, said exxon chairman lawrence g rawl in a statement the charges from the valdez cleanup were partly offset by a one-time gain from a change in accounting methods in the first quarter as a result of changes in federal tax law that raised exxon's income by 535 million for the year without the cleanup charge and accounting gain exxon said its net income for the year would have been 4.7 billion down 10.6 from 1988, despite higher oil and gas prices the decline resulted mainly from slimmer refining and marketing profit margins and lower earnings from chemical operations in the fourth quarter earnings before the valdez charge were 1.28 billion compared to 1.38 billion in the 1988 quarter analysts said exxon's size would insulate it from serious long-term financial damage from the charges i think they did end the year on a strong note largely because of the strength in crude and natural gas pricing said eugene nowak an analyst with dean witter reynolds inc in new york still exxon's stock whose performance has lagged behind that of other major oil firms could suffer from continuing negative publicity surrounding the valdez spill and the subsequent spill of 567,000 gallons of heating oil into the arthur kill waterway between new york and new jersey on jan 2 the bad press will undoubtedly be aggravated when the criminal trial begins next week of the exxon valdez's captain joseph hazelwood smith declined to say what costs the new 500-million charge would cover the previous charges covered everything from wages to boat rentals to boots as well as payments so far of 177 million in claims by fishermen cannery workers and other individuals affected by the spill said exxon spokesman james robertson in anchorage in addition the state of alaska has asked exxon to reimburse it for about 34.5 million in costs so far exxon has paid the state 7.4 million in cash and has agreed to pay bills amounting to 23 million more said the state's oil spill coordinating office exxon must also reimburse the u s coast guard and other federal agencies meanwhile exxon confirmed wednesday that it would shut down its denver exploration and production office which employs about 105 people the office's operations will be transferred to midland tex no decision has been made on the future of the workers in denver said exxon spokesman les rogers in houston
