one of the challenges of international trade is the limited daily time window between businesses on opposite sides of the globe even in one time zone a very large number of telephone calls are unsuccessful either the line is engaged or the person being called is at a meeting and not at his or her desk and even when the person is in the right location they may not after all have the information required with the result that yet another telephone call is required this problem with telephonetag as it is widely known is exacerbated when dealing with people who are in different time zones which means there is only a limited timewindow for this reason voice mail is increasingly being used both nationally and internationally to enhance business communications and thus efficiency but voice mail comes in all flavours ranging upwards from the basic vanilla in many ways voice processing is an extension of the principle of the telephoneanswering machine except that as it is under computer control and connected to the telephone system a voice processing systems can do a lot more systems may be connected to a companys pabx for the benefit of both internal and external users or to the public network ordinary or cellular where the network operator is providing what is in effect a bureau service the biggest of the voice processing business so far has been in these public bureau services such as bts voicebank which gives individuals a telephone number on which people can leave messages for them and voicecom which is aimed at the corporate messaging market in the us and canada there were 23m subscribers to public voice processing services in 1991 according to a recent report by bis strategic decisions some 3bn messages were left on the systems and operators earned a revenue of around dollars 825m in europe growth has been slower according to bis there being about 2780000 subscribers to public systems receiving rather fewer calls per mailbox the revenue was dollars 148m and rather more per subscriber perhaps reflecting a lesscompetitive market advanced voice mail systems allow the recipient to easily reply to a message or to append a note to it and either copy it or forward it to one or more other people in fact just as with conventional office memos voice mail can be sent to an individual or there can be circulation lists recipients act upon reply and forward the memo with or without appended notes for action as required a good example of a company which recognises the need for effective communications is pc software company wordperfect which is wellknown for the quality of its customer support the company uses a brite vm2000 voice messaging system which claims to ensure that telephone calls whether internal or external are always answered the caller also gets information to enable him to make an intelligent response leave a message call again at another time and so on similarly british petroleum has recently installed a vmx system at its london headquarters with the aim of improving the productivity of staff who spend a high proportion of their time on the phone whilst providing a more efficient service to both customers and suppliers bps special projects manager says the new system puts control of the telephone into our own hands it helps save time and effort spent on mundane and timeconsuming tasks such as messagetaking and answering colleagues constantly ringing phones however to make best advantage of voice mail the facilities should be available across the whole organisation here a problem may arise where a network frequently as a result of takeovers and mergers contains a variety of different pabxs and incompatible voice mail products nigel harte mercurys business manager for voice processing comments in the very near future the implementation of amis audio message interchange specification the voice mail equivalent of osi will enable feature transparency between different manufacturers systems this will be an important step because at present messages can generally only be forwarded across a network made up of similar systems nigel harte explains that amis was originally mooted in the us by the manufacturer of voice processing systems vmx coca cola and the pabx manufacturer rolm since then the voice messaging userinterface forum vmuif has been set up to act as the standards body the forum is attracting a growing number of other suppliers such as octel communications and operators have joined the versatility of voice mail can be seen from the virtual telephone vt developed by octel in conjunction with brazilian telecommunications operator telebras the vt is intended for parts of the country where there is a long waiting list for telephones using the system which is implemented on an octel voice mail system callers can leave detailed messages in a mailbox each vtuser carries a pager so that when a message reaches his mailbox he is bleeped and can then go to the nearest phone in which can be retrieved by the virtual telephone owner from any phone including pay phones thus most of the benefits of an actual individual telephone can be rapidly provided by the administration at a fraction of the cost and in a manner which will not become obsolete even when the number of telephones grows
