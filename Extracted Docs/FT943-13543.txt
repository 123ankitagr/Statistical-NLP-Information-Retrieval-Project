microsoft's settlement of anti-trust charges with the us justice department and european competition authorities will have no material impact on financial performance according to mr bill gates chairman and founder of the software company the settlement which requires microsoft to modify its operating system licensing practices eliminates something that could have become a major distraction mr gates said yesterday he reiterated his belief that microsoft had never done anything inappropriate or illegal the company's success in selling operating systems programs for pcs was based on demand not on licensing terms industry analysts said microsoft got off easy on justice department charges that it built a barricade of exclusionary and unreasonably restrictive licensing agreements to deny others an opportunity to develop and market competing products investors appeared to concur with this view as microsoft's share price rose dollars 1 7 8 yesterday to reach dollars 50 1 2 by the close mr gates said microsoft's future remained dependent upon its ability to continue to come up with great products the settlement provided the company with an opportunity to do that without the burden of a costly legal battle competition authorities had examined several issues raised by competitors microsoft said most were not pursued and the settlement covered only licensing practices and non-disclosure the settlement does not address concern in the software industry that microsoft gains unfair advantages as a developer of both operating systems which control the basic functions of a computer and applications programs such as wordprocessors games and spreadsheets microsoft is the largest seller of applications for use with its own windows operating system this dual role is its principal advantage according to software industry executives because microsoft's applications developers have earlier and better access to details of next-generation systems than their competitors however mr bill neukom microsoft's general counsel said this issue did not come up in the discussions we can conclude that the government decided that it had no basis on which to act on these complaints for the next six and a half years the duration of the settlement microsoft's business activities will be monitored by the us justice department and european competition authorities editorial comment page 15 lex page 16
