while european information technology companies continue to experience difficulties their japanese counterparts are patiently expanding their presence on the continent and in the uk although fujitsu's acquisition last year of icl garnered the most headlines scores of japanese companies are developing production facilities creating sales networks and searching for potential joint venture partners in the region we very much respect the marketing and software capabilities of european firms especially their network architecture says mr hideichi nose vice-president for european operations at nec most observers believe that except for sales channels and some software most european companies have little to offer their japanese rivals besides political cover european information technology companies rank very low on the list of who the japanese fear says mr david benda an analyst at barclays de zoete wedd asia in tokyo the japanese want to have a presence in europe but what can they get by acquiring a company not much except for distribution he adds japanese companies prefer to stay away from high-profile acquisitions even friendly ones such as icl instead most are concentrating on establishing their own production and sales networks preferably in the form of joint ventures we have to be certain that investments in fields like semiconductors are welcome says mr taizo nishimuro general manager for overseas operations at toshiba it might be easier to go it 100 per cent alone or to buy out an existing firm but it doesn't guarantee us that those actions will be welcomed by the community most observers believe toshiba will not be alone in co-operating with its european competitors olivetti may be forced to strengthen ties with various japanese companies including hitachi which provides it with hardware on an oem basis siemens sells fujitsu mainframes and supercomputers licenses drams from toshiba and given its distribution and service networks is a natural match for a japanese partner meanwhile bull's increasing problems may force it to fully embrace nec which now provides the french company with mainframes bull has to figure out what it's going to cut what it's going to keep and what it's going to source out says mr steve myers analyst at jardine fleming securities in tokyo it's entirely conceivable but not certain that bull will become dependent on nec hardware and choose to add value through software he says such arrangements japanese hardware and customised local software are expected to increase as more production becomes application specific fujitsu has formed joint ventures with quotient of the uk and the british subsidiary of mcdonnell douglas to develop software for the banking and cad cam industries respectively toshiba is developing cmos chips with sgs thomson microelectronics of holland while other japanese producers are sourcing out much of their local software and design work moreover even with higher capital costs and mounting overcapacity in the memory chip market japanese companies have not abandoned direct investment nec plans to begin construction of a new computer production facility in germany and has just completed upgrading its plant in scotland to produce four megabit drams fujitsu will soon finish a new production facility in durham in northern england to produce similar chips investment has slowed admits mr mike jeremy an analyst at baring securities japan but not as much as had been expected many analysts argue that one of the attractions of western europe is its position as a springboard for eastern european market over 60 per cent of japanese products sold in eastern europe are shipped from japanese subsidiaries in the ec naturally because of its proximity and its similar culture we do feel entering eastern europe is easier through the west especially germany says mr nishimuro as personal incomes grow in the former comecon states the market will shift from large-scale infrastructure projects a relative european strength to consumer-driven purchases sure to favour the japanese say most analysts moreover some japanese companies are attracted by the east's low wages and relatively well-educated workforce such allures may lead many japanese companies to shift much of their assembly operations to the east and to concentrate on more value-added production in the west to the extent you put semiconductor production into western europe board stuffing can then be done where it's cheapest says mr myers political uncertainties remain the greatest fear among senior executives in tokyo fujitsu in particular is wary of projecting a high-profile image icl is a different company says mr yuri momomoto of fujitsu they have their own plans which we don't know about regardless except for political sensitivities and perhaps being privy to the setting of standards most japanese companies seem unconcerned with being shut out of european research consortia largely because japanese companies have much more to contribute than the europeans themselves it doesn't make sense to keep out the japanese says mr jeremy the europeans will lose the opportunity to monitor them it's a two-way street it's no more machiavellian than that in addition many argue that dictates from brussels may ultimately backfire a 1990 decision by the european commission setting minimum prices for japanese chips allegedly being dumped in europe may help japanese producers beset by falling prices in the same way a similar 1985 us decree now expired rescued a japanese chip industry drowning in its own overcapacity moreover adds mr benda as europe continues to insist that more products be manufactured locally more japanese companies will come posing a further threat to european companies others argue however that even if japanese companies were to show that they are politically correct by participating in projects such as the research consortia it is doubtful that they would be willing to share any of their most advanced technology something they have never done in the past there must be another mechanism by which the japanese are forced to share some of their technology says a tokyo-based industry observer if the europeans don't band together and try to do something then they may as well throw in the towel
