LIBERAL Democrat spokesman on the Citizen 's Charter , Mr Matthew Taylor , yesterday wrote to the chancellor demanding an explanation for the 'astonishing rise in unpaid tax ' after his party claimed official figures showed Pounds 1.7bn was written off by the Treasury last year . Between 1991 and 1992 alone unpaid tax more than doubled - 'an increase of Pounds 640m ' , Mr Taylor said .
