China on Saturday rejected a resolution by a U.N. panel criticizing last June 's suppression of this country 's democracy movement , calling the resolution `` illegal and null and void . '' `` The resolution brazenly interfered in China 's internal affairs , attempting to exert pressure on China , '' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement reported by the official New China news agency . The resolution , the first by a U.N. body criticizing China since the crackdown on pro-democracy protesters , was approved Thursday in Geneva by the U.N. Subcommittee on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities . Backed by Western nations and approved 15 to 9 by the panel , the resolution expressed `` concern about the events '' in China and `` about their consequences in the field of human rights . '' It also appealed for clemency for people detained in the crackdown . A Foreign Ministry statement said that `` only a very small number '' of offenders had been punished for criminal offenses . Official reports say at least 4,000 people have been arrested since the crackdown , but Western and Chinese sources place the number as high as 30,000 nationwide . Included are dozens of journalists , intellectuals and others detained without being charged .
