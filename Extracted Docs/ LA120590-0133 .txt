Bob Johnson , one of the most successful football coaches in the Southern Section the past 13 years , announced his resignation Tuesday at El Toro High School . Johnson 's teams compiled a 119-45 record and won six league and three Southern Section titles . El Toro also qualified for the playoffs 13 straight years , the longest current streak in Orange County . Johnson said his desire to support and watch his sons , Bret and Rob , throughout their college careers was the reason for his decision to resign . Bret is a junior quarterback at Michigan State , having transferred from UCLA after losing his starting job this season ; Rob , a senior at El Toro , is a highly recruited quarterback who has not yet made a college commitment . `` I 'm not burned out , and there 's nothing I enjoy more than coaching kids , '' said Johnson , 45 . `` But I 've followed both of my sons ' athletic careers since they were youngsters and I want to watch them play college football . `` I do n't want to be coaching at Muirlands and La Paz ( Mission Viejo High ) while Bret is playing in South Bend , Ind . I 've always been there for my kids , so it 's time to put my profession on hold . `` I want to coach again . I 'm not done coaching . I 'm going to take a back seat for a while , '' said Johnson , who said he 'll likely consider coaching again once his sons finish college . `` I 'm a guy who does n't look down the road that much , but maybe in a year or so I 'll think I need to get back . `` There 's a lot of me that wants to go into college football . We 've done quite a bit in the high school area -- but I would n't say I would n't go back to that either . '' Johnson was hired at El Toro in 1978 after being an assistant coach at Los Amigos . He immediately built the program into one of the strongest in the county . El Toro was the tri-champion of the Sea View League in Johnson 's third season and the school won the league title three straight years from 1980-82 . El Toro won its first postseason championship , defeating Fullerton , 35-19 , for the Central Conference title in 1982 . El Toro 's Southern Conference championship team finished 14-0 in 1986 and is considered one of the best in county history . The team featured Johnson 's son , Bret , who was named the county 's back of the year as a junior . `` This team deserves to be ranked with anyone you want to talk about , '' Bob Johnson said after the title game . El Toro repeated as Southern Conference champion in 1987 , finishing 12-2 . El Toro 's only losses in 1987 came while Bret was recovering from knee surgery . Despite the injury , Bret repeated as the county 's back of the year . After an off-year in 1988 , El Toro returned to a postseason championship game in 1989 with son Rob playing wide receiver . The Chargers lost to Paramount , 26-20 , in the Division III title game . Rob moved to quarterback this season and led El Toro to a second-place finish in the South Coast League . But once again , Paramount beat El Toro in the playoffs , 19-8 , in the semifinals of the Division II playoffs . `` I would n't trade the last 13 years for anything , '' Johnson said . `` I 've enjoyed the challenge of being the No . 1 team in the county and the relationship I had with the staff and players at El Toro . `` The staff here was responsible for our success . We always maintained some of the best high school coaches in the county , and the program 's success will continue long after I 'm gone . `` These are important times in my sons ' lives , and ( Johnson 's wife ) Debbie and I made a decision to support our sons . We 'll be traveling , tailgating and enjoying the games as fans for a change . '' Johnson will continue to teach physical education at El Toro . Don Martin , El Toro principal , said he did n't anticipate opening the coaching position until after the holiday break . `` We have plenty of time until spring ball begins , '' Martin said .
