People from ethnic minorities are much more likely to be unemployed than their white counterparts , although far higher numbers of young ethnic minority Britons are studying full-time , says a report today by the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Commission for Racial Equality . The unemployment rate for ethnic minority women is 16 per cent , compared with 6 per cent for white women . Ethnic minority men have a 20 per cent unemployment rate compared with 11 per cent for white men . The report found that even when members of ethnic minority groups attained higher qualifications - above A-level or equivalent - unemployment levels remain far higher than among white men and women .
