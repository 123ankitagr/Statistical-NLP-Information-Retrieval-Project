The City Council voted Tuesday to make an exception to its zoning laws to allow a new restaurant on Main Street . Jay Fiondella , who has operated Chez Jay on Ocean Avenue for 30 years , will now be able to move the restaurant to a building he recently purchased on Main Street . `` I 'm elated . It 's been a long , rocky road , '' Fiondella said after the council approved the exemption by a 5-2 vote . Council members Ken Genser and Judy Abdo said they were sympathetic to Fiondella , but voted against the exemption because they oppose any waivers of a city ordinance that allows only four restaurants on each block of Main Street in the downtown area .
