the popular science fiction author stanislaw lem wrote a short comic story about an intergalactic pirate who is obsessed with adding to his store of information pirate pugg kidnaps space travellers and forces them to tell him everything they know he is finally defeated by a contraption that spews out all kinds of detailed but unimportant information such as how many sizes of bedroom slippers are available on the continent of cob pirate pugg is unable to tear himself away from the growing mountain of information in case he comes across the answer to the ultimate mystery of being sometimes when i'm roaming the internet i feel like pirate pugg there is an incredible amount of information available through the internet but finding something useful is a frustrating experience the internet allows you to access information on tens of millions of computers worldwide and brings the prospect of a global repository of knowledge mostly free users or surfers as they like to be called can access huge amounts of information there are hundreds of millions of plain-text articles accessible on a huge variety of topics newsletters and magazines of various kinds are proliferating on the internet since it is the cheapest way to publish there are no printing costs and almost no mailing costs the beauty of digital technology is that the digital text can be duplicated virtually for nothing while putting information out on to the internet is easy the problem is finding the right piece of information when you need it and here is where we need new technologies to help us sift huge amounts of information strictly speaking we should not call it information until we have processed it ourselves until it informs us about something we were looking for everything on the internet should be considered as data of one kind or another it becomes information when we have turned that data into a useful form but finding a specific piece of data can be a mammoth chore formulating a vaguely phrased search can return an enormous amount of leads such searches are normally based on the presence of specific key words in millions of documents sending out a more detailed search request narrows the choices but here is where the problem lies often a narrow search will non find a relevant and possibly more useful document because it does not contain the keywords or contains them in a low number what is needed are specific tools that can carry out searches with a certain amount of artificial intelligence an approach that takes into account the less focused aspects of conducting searches such tools are the key to unlocking the potential of the internet while many internet enthusiasts champion the egalitarian culture of the internet where many people throw information into a collective repository without concern for payment there is as yet little evidence to show how useful it is to have access to this huge pool of information for example when gutenberg invented the printing press it helped generate an information explosion since books could be produced more quickly and more cheaply than ever before this resulted in the flowering of the renaissance and the rediscovery of ancient greek roman and arabic texts that led to establishing modern science and accelerated the move away from feudal societies will the internet and future information superhighways result in a similar impact on society or are we already in information overload and unable to effectively process the information we have access to my suspicion is that the latter is true many of us seek and hoard information like lem's pirate pugg but we are often unable to fully make use of it in a meaningful way
