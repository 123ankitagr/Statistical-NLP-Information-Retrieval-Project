A Cornell University graduate student blamed for a rogue computer program that infected as many as 6,000 computers with an electronic virus was indicted today on a felony computer-crime charge . Robert Tappan Morris was indicted by a federal grand jury in Syracuse , N.Y. , on one count of accessing without authorization at least six computers in which the federal government has an interest . Morris , who has been criticized by a Cornell University commission that investigated last November 's computer virus incident , is the first person to be charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 , the Justice Department said . Morris , who is on leave from Cornell , could face a possible five-year sentence and a $ 250,000 fine if convicted . He could also be required to pay restitution to universities and military bases where computers were paralyzed by the virus . Morris has told friends that he created the virus but did not intend for it to invade computers around the country . The virus infected as many as 6,000 university and military computers on the nationwide ARPANET network , which is used by universities and military contractors to transmit unclassified data . The network was virtually shut down for several days , although no information stored in the computers was lost .
