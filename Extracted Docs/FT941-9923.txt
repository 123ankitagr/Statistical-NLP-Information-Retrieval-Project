Merck , the world 's largest drugs group , will today reveal it is developing a new compound to treat enlarged prostate , a condition that affects 50 per cent of men over 60 and 70 per cent over 70 . More than 10m Americans are affected by the disease . Dr Roy Vagelos , chairman and chief executive , and Dr Edward Scolnick , president of Merck research laboratories , will present analysts with early clinical data about the new compound showing that it is effective . The new drug , if successfully developed , will prove an important element in Merck's growing prostate franchise . Merck has already developed a compound called Proscar to treat the condition , also known as benign prostatic hyperplasia . However , the drug has struggled to generate expected sales . Specialists have been concerned about the drug 's effectiveness , although they admit the safety profile is excellent . The condition , which involves the enlarged prostate obstructing the flow of urine from the bladder through the penis , causing the need for frequent and urgent urination , is normally treated by surgery .
