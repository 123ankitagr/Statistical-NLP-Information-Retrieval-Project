RJR Nabisco , the large US foods and tobacco group , yesterday formed a new international foods division and hired Mr Richard Thoman , a former top executive at American Express , as its president . The 48-year-old Mr Thoman , who was previously a co-chief executive of the travel related services ( TRS ) division of American Express and the man in charge of international banking operations , will become president of Nabisco International . He will be one of four RJR division heads reporting to Mr Louis Gerstner , the RJR Nabisco chairman who resigned as president of American Express three years ago . Mr Thoman was replaced as co-chief executive of the American Express TRS division last October , as was Mr Ed Cooperman , who also left American Express and now works as a senior executive for Mr Sandy Weill , another former American Express president who is chairman of Primerica , the financial services group . The American Express TRS division , the core of the travel and financial services group , suffered a more-than-halved 1991 net income of Dollars 396m . The main cause was large losses at the Optioma credit card business in the US , a business that was not Mr Thoman 's direct responsibility . Mr Thoman and Mr Cooperman were replaced as chief executive of TRS by Mr Harvey Golub , who was named the new president of American Express a year ago . Mr Thoman left American Express in February of this year and remained a consultant until June . The Nabisco international foods division that Mr Thoman will run is estimated by analysts to have had 1991 revenues of about Dollars 800m , against total foods revenues of Dollars 6.5bn . The international foods business has a workforce of 13,200 , out of a total of 36,000 employees in the Nabisco foods business . Mr Gerstner said the recruiting of Mr Thoman was aimed at 'underscoring this company 's commitment in the international food arena . '
