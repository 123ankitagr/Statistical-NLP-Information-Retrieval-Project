europe's national aid budgets could eventually be pooled as part of a common foreign trade policy according to officials in brussels this long-term objective has emerged as efforts gather pace to lay common ground rules across the european community for tied aid and export credit terms to developing countries the ec has in the past year set up two working parties intended to prepare reports on eventual harmonisation of export finance practices among member states it has also worked closely with the paris-based organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd on limiting how tied aid can be mixed with commercial credits to win contracts in the developing world since february 15, such aid can only be mixed in projects that are not commercially viable and in the poorest of developing countries country by country exporters complain that cheap export credit insurance and the practice of mixing aid with commercial loans are used by competitors to snatch contracts the possibility of pooling aid funds is the longest-term aim of one of the two working parties that headed by an official seconded from coface france's leading export credit agency this group is concentrating on non-marketable risk export finance that cannot be commercially supported because the project has a life of more than three years or because it is in a poor or volatile country where the danger of default is high the first aim of the group is to harmonise technical ground conditions for providing export credit cover this will include getting export credit agencies to agree on the percentage of the value of a contract they will insure what kinds of risk they will insure and for how many years cover will be provided the second aim will be to harmonise export credit insurance premium rates stage three will aim to establish a common cover policy under which governments agree on what risk category different export markets fall into adjusting premium rates accordingly at present many governments tinker with rates as part of their foreign or defence policies pointing cheap credits at allies regardless of commercial risk if the maastricht treaty on european union is completed then it should make it easier to reach a common foreign trade policy an ec official said with this and a common cover policy for developing countries in place it would be a comparatively small step to pooling national aid funds centrally in the ec exporters from across the ec could then tap the common aid pool regardless of which country is sponsoring a project it would be too idealistic to over-estimate the speed of progress that is possible an official said we have to move forward cautiously
