Shares in Harrington Kilbride , the specialist publisher , fell a further 10p to 58p yesterday as news of its Pounds 3m additional provision for bad debts was digested . The provision , mainly for debts from eastern Europe where the company has expanded considerably in the last two years , turned the 1993 pre-tax profit of Pounds 2.42m into a loss and has put the proposed final dividend of 3.2p in doubt . The move was prompted by the collection of 1993 debts being slower than expected . A detailed review of its trade debtors is being undertaken . Accounts will not now be presented to the annual meeting being held this Friday . An extraordinary meeting is to be convened as soon as possible . The shares fell 66p on Friday .
