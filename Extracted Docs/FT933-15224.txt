YASUDA Fire and Marine Insurance , the Japanese non-life company , has agreed to take a 10 per cent stake in INA Life Insurance , a Japanese arm of the Cigna group of the US , in preparation for planned reforms of the Japanese life market . The Japanese government is planning to dismantle the barriers between non-life companies and life assurers after 1995 , and Yasuda said the stake in the Japanese arm of a US company would allow it to gain experience in the life market in advance of the changes . Under Japanese law , Yasuda can take no more than the 10 per cent stake , for which it paid an undisclosed sum . Japanese reports suggested that the company invested Y5bn ( Dollars 46.4m ) , but Yasuda would not confirm that figure . INA , established in Japan in 1981 , had assets of Y136.3bn at the end of March and collected Y71.4bn in premiums last financial year . Under the agreement , Yasuda will send trainees to INA to gain experience in the life business , while INA products will be sold through Yasuda 's office network . The Yasuda strategy is similar to that of larger Japanese banks , which have prepared for their gradual entry into the securities market by holding strategic stakes in medium-sized Japanese brokerages and routinely rotating staff through these companies .
