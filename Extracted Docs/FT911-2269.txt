Sir , Richard Lapper 's report ( 'Lloyd 's names face Pounds 100m cash call ' , April 24 ) makes me wonder how many fellow members of Lloyd 's 'Marine' syndicates 406 and 448 were previously made aware by their advisers of the syndicates ' involvement in such lethal non-marine business . And how many knew that 'closed ' back years meant the opposite in the arcane and shadowy world of insurance underwriting ? I trust that Names will require to be satisfied that syndicate managers were acting within their authority before making contributions to the disastrous losses to which Mr Lapper refers .
