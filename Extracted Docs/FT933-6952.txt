TALKS between British Aerospace and Taiwanese officials to rescue a proposed joint venture have spilled over into a third day , write Daniel Green and Dennis Engbarth in Taipei . Fourteen hours of meetings yesterday remained mired in the details of how the aircraft manufacturing venture , called Avro , will be financed . The deal is central to BAe 's strategy to improve its profitability . The RJ series of regional jet aircraft that would be built partly in Taiwan currently loses money for the company . Taiwanese banks want to limit their exposure to the fortunes of Avro . They are seeking assurances that the assets BAe is putting into Avro - land , plant and machinery in the UK - qualify as collateral for their loans rather than loans from UK banks . The Taiwanese cabinet minister involved in the talks , Mr Chiang Ping-Kun , economic affairs minister , confessed he 'did not understand ' UK banking law on collateral . Taiwanese law prevents a bank from making unsecured loans to a company in which it has more than a 3 per cent stake . This limit is exceeded by the state-owned Chiao Tung Bank , which heads the consortium of lender banks . Chiao Tung Bank officials will continue their talks with BAe today . Another team from Taiwan Aerospace Corporation , the joint venture partner , will address guarantees that aerospace technologies will be transferred to Taiwan and the conditions under which a new range of aircraft , the RJX , would be developed .
