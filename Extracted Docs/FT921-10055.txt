it is not new for americans to criticise japan even to the extent of smashing a japanese car with a sledgehammer in protest at japanese trade practices as happened in detroit this week nor is it new for the odd japanese politician to insult american workers as mr kiichi miyazawa the japanese prime minister inadvertently did this week when he questioned americans work ethic what is novel is the reaction these insults have provoked in japan people are at last beginning to say what they have long felt that in some respects at least the japanese way of life is superior to americas mr takayoshi miyagawa a public opinion poll expert says america today is no longer the america which we admired for so long the smashing of the honda car was widely publicised in japanese newspapers one commentator said this childish american stunt makes us feel even more contempt for americans and although mr miyazawa apologised for the misunderstanding caused by his remarks many japanese feel that he accurately reflected their feelings in saying that too many americans went to work on wall street and too few in industry japanese employees do work longer hours than their us counterparts an average of 2201 hours in 1990 compared with about 1900 in the us according to german economic institute figures but japanese productivity remains lower than in the us in 1988 japan was 80 per cent as productive as the us although the gap is narrowing there was also some annoyance that the comments had been reported overseas one former foreign ministry official said that since the prime minister had been talking in the diet he might have assumed that he was speaking only to japanese a sign perhaps of the distance the japanese still have to travel before they are truly at home in an international environment indeed japan remains uncertain of the position it wants in world politics the governments policy is to secure greater influence through increased participation in the un including a permanent seat on the security council but most japanese people are wary witness the popular opposition to a bill that would allow japanese servicemen to join un peacekeeping missions taxpayers are increasingly critical of japans contributions to overseas aid one official says that when he spoke in a provincial city he was asked why spend it abroad spend it here in political affairs therefore the us is likely to continue to take the lead over japan much depends on how the recent spate of japanese criticism of the us develops it could die away as did public protests about the security pact and the vietnam war moreover antius feelings mix uneasily with a love of things american mcdonalds and cocacola baseball arnold schwarzenegger and madonna all are worshipped in japan hawaii is the most popular holiday destination equally if some japanese are quick to condemn americans for being lazy illeducated and spendthrift others are sad to see a great ally humbled among them is mr miyazawa who during mr bushs visit called on the japanese to help the us in return for the support america extended after the war he has said that the us saved japan from starvation during mr bushs visit however the japanese felt deeply insulted by the chief executives of the big three us motor companies who accompanied him and who demanded that japanese carmakers agree to buy their products if anything can promote antiamericanism in japan it is bullying over economic issues by the us as mr miyazawa says when the us acts like a dictator over japanese businesses then we feel contempt towards the us
