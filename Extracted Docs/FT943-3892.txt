three years ago austrade australia's main trade promotion organisation had 18 offices in asia today it has 30 the increase speaks volumes for the effort australian politicians and industrial representatives are putting into expanding links with the region last week alone a delegation of 50 landed in beijing to promote wool products in tokyo mr paul keating australian prime minister lauded the benefits of an asian free trade area to his japanese counterpart while back home a drive to boost exports of services was launched australia's attempts to build economic links with asia are usually traced to the early 1970 s and were in part a response to the decision by britain australia's traditional trading partner to throw its lot in with europe but these efforts have accelerated in recent years and in broad terms are producing results as politicians enthusiastically note more than 60 per cent of australia's exports of goods now go to asia compared with 26 per cent in 1960 by contrast exports to western europe including the uk accounted for only 13 per cent of last year's total against 46 per cent three decades ago the annual rate at which this asian business is expanding is also impressive although export growth has slackened from the double-digit percentage increases of the late 1980 s australia's total trade with asia advanced by almost 12 per cent last year to nearly adollars 67 bn pounds 32 bn exports were up by about 9 per cent meaning that an additional adollars 3.3 bn worth of goods were sold imports rose by 14 per cent but the need to do even better is paramount for years australia has had a structural problem with its current account running deficits and then partially funding these with foreign capital inflows in the 1970 s the trend was for the current account deficit to represent an increasing proportion of gross domestic product from 1982 onwards the position stabilised at 4 to 5 per cent of gdp but did not improve by the end of 1993, net foreign debt stood at about 43 per cent of gdp the current concern is that a strong upturn in the domestic economy will spell problems for australia's trade balance in the upswing of a business cycle australia's imports tend to rise faster than exports partly because of the need for foreign-made plant and equipment so worsening the current account deficit the combination of rising imports and a falling dollar contributes to higher inflation in response interest rates have to be raised in short boom and bust a substantially improved export performance would help remedy the situation as mr bernie fraser governor of the reserve bank of australia has put it the best way for australia to grow faster and escape the external constraints of large current account deficits and rising foreign debt is through increased exports asia with its high-growth economies and relative proximity is the obvious target if the argument for pursuing asian trade is compelling realising this objective is complicated for several reasons first australia has traditionally acted as asia's farm and quarry raw materials and unprocessed agricultural produce primary products accounted for 55 per cent of total australian exports to asia last year the biggest categories were coal gold iron ore aluminium beef wool crude oil and natural gas continuing to rely on these exports means being hostage to volatile price cycles while growth in demand is relatively slow moreover the vicissitudes of nature can intervene at present there are concerns about the trade implications of a severe drought in key east-coast agricultural areas so the focus of the government's export drive falls on elaborately transformed manufactures or etms a trade department category which covers products with unique features which permit their identification as differentiated products on world markets that is skim milk powder does not count while branded macadamia nut chocolates do etm exports have been growing more quickly than exports overall and now account for about 14 per cent of total sales to asia but trade officials admit it can be difficult to make inroads i think we and everyone else find the japanese market quite hard work says mr ralph evans head of austrade second the mix of export destinations looks slightly less healthy when examined in detail japan dominates the picture accounting for 25 per cent of australia's total exports and about 40 per cent of those going to asia here the main exports are beef coal and iron ore orders and prices for the latter two have been adversely affected by the japanese recession and its effect on the steel and power industries sales to the china hong kong region however are more encouraging they rose by more than one-fifth in 1993, and the balance of etms to primary products is significantly better mr evans says this is one of the most important areas for exporters in the next few years along with indonesia australia's nearest neighbour a third problem for the export drive into asia is the level of trade barriers in the region and australia's limited clout in combating them given its small domestic market and different cultural history the six countries of the association of south east asian nations which now have a regional free trade agreement aimed at lowering barriers to intra-asian trade are themselves forging links with bigger economies to their north such as china it is not clear what advantage if any they would see in admitting australia to their ranks at a transport conference in darwin last week a malaysian trade consultant made the point bluntly many people in asia will need to be convinced that it in is their interests that australia becomes part of asia australia has responded partly by lobbying within the asia-pacific economic co-operation forum a loose grouping of some australasian asian and north and south american countries much play was made in australia of an internally generated apec report for leaders of member states which called for complete trade liberalisation in the region by the year 2020 but for some companies seeking to export to the region this and the latest gatt agreement are all-too distant promises there's a lot of talk and i know the australian government is putting on a lot of pressure but these countries are not moving on trade barriers says mr peter horeaens director of asian operations at kellogg australia the us-based cereal manufacturer tariffs on cereal-based products for example range up to 60 per cent in thailand and more than 100 per cent in pakistan he says fourth australia's ability to aid would-be exporters is more limited than that of some competitors chasing the same business in asia a function of the country's size compared to group of seven nations we don't have such deep pockets when it comes to export credit guarantee financing and the like says mr evans of austrade finally and perhaps most controversially there is a price to be paid for putting trade and asian relations so high on the agenda australia is by no means the only country negotiating the culture clash between western values and those of asian countries but if this is a tough problem for a large country with well-defined beliefs like the us it is every bit as problematic for a country with a small economy which is still trying to establish its own national identity trade talks with indonesian representatives invariably incite demonstrations over the east timor situation for example ministerial visits to china rekindle human rights concerns and so on asian trade is a path which australia has little option but to tread and it is doing so with impressive determination but steering a route round the potholes will remain a substantial task australia trade asia
