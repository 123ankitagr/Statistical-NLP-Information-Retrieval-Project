question i read with interest and some remorse your recent column on buying a new home for less than you sold your original house i was certainly unaware of the potential tax consequences of doing this but i got to wondering if there was a possible way out of the problem since i now face a huge tax bill suppose i sell my lessexpensive second house within the two years i am allowed to find a replacement house of equal or greater value than the first and then buy a third house that is more expensive than what i sold the first one for will this nullify my tax problem l g answer not entirely but your tax problem could be eased heres the situation the internal revenue service says you are liable for taxes on any profit that you realize from the sale of your principal residence that you do not invest in a new home homeowners over age 55 are allowed to shelter $ 125000 but thats the only exception to the law the irs gives you 24 months in which to buy a replacement house according to our experts the government allows you to designate the house to be considered this replacement residence heres how the plan you have suggested could work lets say you sold your original house for $ 500000 and bought a replacement for $ 350000 you would potentially face paying taxes on $ 150000 worth of gain that was not reinvested but if within that 24month period you sold this second residence and bought a third for $ 600000 and designated that house as your replacement one the original tax bill would be erased however you would face taxes on any gain you realized from the sale of the second residence so if that second house sold for $ 380000 you would be taxed on a $ 30000 gain that was not reinvested because you are not allowed to reinvest gains from two houses into a third also be prepared to file an amended tax return for the year of the first sale choosing between exhusbands benefits q i was married for the first time for 21 years my second marriage lasted 10 years which exhusbands social security benefits may i apply for i understand that i am technically eligible to apply for either ones benefits since both marriages lasted at least 10 years before the divorce but i know that my first exhusbands social security account is larger how do i find out how much money i would be entitled to draw under his account when i reach retirement age and how do i get his social security number s b a you are allowed to draw social security benefits under the accounts of whichever exspouse you wish no doubt you will choose the account of the ex whose earnings were higher and who is entitled to the higher benefits however if you were still married to husband no 2 you would not be able to claim the benefits of husband no 1 even if his account were more attractive there is one exception if you remarried after age 60 and your former spouse has died you are entitled to claim benefits on your deceased spouse even if you are currently married you can obtain the social security number of your exspouse by contacting your local social security office and giving them all the identifying information you have your exhusbands birth date last known address employers mothers maiden name and birthplace are some of the important facts you should collect also be prepared to prove that you are an exspouse who is entitled to draw benefits at the very least you will need to produce a marriage and divorce certificate a social security worker will open a file for you and help you get the information and benefits to which you are entitled by the way the payment rate for exspouses is 50 of the primary wage earners benefits minus a certain percentage if you elect to draw social security benefits before turning age 65 how to give away money taxfree q i know that an individual may give up to $ 10000 taxfree to another individual each year but i dont exactly understand the timing does the internal revenue service require these gifts to be made a year apart or could they conceivably be made in december of one year and again in january of the next year this is a very pressing problem for me and i can not get either my attorney or accountant to give me an answer e l f a oh dear theres no reason to get upset about this nor is there any reason your attorney or accountant couldnt have given you an answer its all rather simple as far as the irs is concerned what counts is the calendar year in which you make your gift you may give $ 10000 to someone in december and turn around and do it again in january the gifts could be made a month apart or a day apart its the year that counts we hope you feel less pressed withdrawing funds from a 5year account q in 1987 when i was 64 years old i rolled over a $ 28000 pension payout into an individual retirement account the account was a fiveyear certificate of deposit paying 86 interest i remember signing a form calling for a penalty for early withdrawal now i am wondering if i can take all or part of my account out and transfer it into another ira without being penalized s k a in all likelihood the agreement you signed leaves you liable for an early withdrawal penalty from your savings institution should you decide to move your funds the reason is simply that you agreed to make a fiveyear investment you can not withdraw your funds before this investment matures the nature and type of penalty will be set by the institution not the government which only imposes a penalty if you withdraw and use your ira funds before turning age 59 12 if your ira were in a shorterterm investment or an account that permitted you access to it you would not face this penalty the government allows all ira holders to move their accounts without penalty if the transaction is completed within 60 days by the way the penalty you face from the savings and loan institution would be imposed regardless of whether your funds were being held in an ira or some other type of savings account the institution is merely enforcing the maturity date of the investment you made carla lazzareschi can not answer mail individually but will respond in this column to financial questions of general
