THE growth rate in Germany 's money supply fell in November for the first time this year , but was still running far ahead of target . Provisional Bundesbank figures yesterday showed expansion in the broad M3 measure dropped to an annualised 9.3 per cent last month . Though an improvement on October 's 10.3 per cent , it was well above the 8.8 per cent recorded in August ( the last 'normal ' month ) and almost 4 percentage points above the bank 's top target range for 1992 of 5.5 per cent . Figures for September ( up 9.3 per cent ) and October were distorted by the effects of central bank intervention in the recent currency crisis . Yesterday 's figures showed high interest rates have yet to dampen demand for money . Private-sector loans continued to expand , and the volume of cash in circulation rose because of seasonal factors , the bank said . The fall had been widely forecast , and further decreases in coming months are expected as recession takes hold . Sharp cuts in industrial capital investment plans for 1993 are likely to affect the M3 measure as 1993 advances . Some economists believe monetary expansion could fall within the Bundesbank 's 1993 target range of 4.5-6.5 per cent early next year . Money supply control is a main aim in its search for monetary stability and cutting inflation : prerequisites for interest rate cuts .
