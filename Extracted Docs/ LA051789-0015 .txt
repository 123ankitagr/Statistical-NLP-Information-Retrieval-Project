I can not believe what I have just read . The article by Thomas was very upsetting . Is there no law requiring proper disposal of all tissue removed from humans ? I had miscarriages followed by D & Cs , and I was assured all material was disposed of properly and respectfully . The material was supplied to the young girl by her uncle who was a pathologist . Is that proper and respectful disposal ? DORTHA KAUFMAN Glendale
