the us justice department's decision to pursue an anti-trust investigation of microsoft makes it increasingly likely that the world's largest computer software company will face charges of illegal anti-competitive business practices justice officials disclosed on friday they had initiated an inquiry after a preliminary review of evidence gathered by the federal trade commission in its three-year anti-trust probe of the company simultaneously the ftc said it had voted to close its investigation of microsoft after deadlocking in february and again in july on whether to take action against the company mr donald clark ftc secretary warned the company that the commission's decision should not to be construed as a determination that a violation may not have occurred the justice department's involvement represents a much more serious threat to microsoft than it faced from the ftc said wendy goldman rohm author of a book soon to be published on microsoft's anti-trust battle the ftc had narrowed its case against microsoft to issues unlikely to have a significant financial pact on the company but the justice department is expected to broaden the case raising the possibility of tougher sanctions and even perhaps an order to break up the company microsoft has denied any wrongdoing and insists it will be vindicated but the case raises serious concerns for the clinton administration which has identified high-tech industries as the engine for economic growth microsoft is a prime example of the enterprise the administration aims to encourage a world market leader that has demonstrated us competitiveness the company recently reported its 18 th consecutive year of growth in revenues and profits over the past five years microsoft's sales have grown by an average 46 per cent a year to reach dollars 3.75 bn pounds 2.48 bn in fiscal 1993, ending june 30 microsoft dominates the market for personal computer operating systems programs that control the basic functions of a pc microsoft's ms-dos is used on more than 90 per cent of pcs microsoft's windows program which provides point and click control for pcs is also a runaway success with over 30 m copies in use competitors claim microsoft's success has come at their expense alleging the company abuses its dominant role in the pc operating system software market to exclude or disadvantage competitors but a recent study suggests microsoft has been the driving force behind software industry growth the study by telecommunications research group concludes almost 500 companies have been formed in the us to create pc software to work with microsoft's windows with more than 17,300 jobs created microsoft windows has created an industry of new companies that together have annual revenues of about dollars 280 m and more than dollars 1.3 bn in incremental revenues for established software firms the study concludes yet the vast majority of these companies are very small the typical software firm employs just six people and generates about dollars 560,000 in annual revenues according to trg all are beholden to microsoft reknowned as an aggressive competitor microsoft's role in the industry is frequently compared to the power that ibm wielded in the computer market of the 1970 s and early 1980 s just as in its heyday ibm set industry standards dominated markets and instilled fear uncertainty and doubt into competitors so today microsoft can call the shots in the pc industry ironically such comparisons have taken on a new dimension just as ibm battled through 13 years of justice department anti-trust investigation from 1969 to 1982, so big green as microsoft is nicknamed in the computer industry now faces similar scrutiny although the justice department ultimately dropped its anti-trust case against ibm the investigation had a serious impact which many analysts believe contributed to its inability to keep pace with changes in the market and to its current problems the government collected 760 m documents from ibm during its 13-year anti-trust investigation ibm's top executives were afraid to put anything down on paper for fear the government would subpoena the document lawyers who were developing a stranglehold on the business decided what could be said at meetings says mr paul carroll in big blues the unmaking of ibm to be published next month microsoft faces a period of intense scrutiny that seems certain to consume the attention of its senior management the anti-trust investigation could prove to be a serious distraction for a company renowned for its tight focus nothing would please microsoft's competitors more i've developed a view that being successful is not a fun thing sometimes mr bill gates chairman and chief executive said recently there is just a phenomenon where people don't like a company as successful as ours
