1990 and early 1991 have seen monetary contraction in most of the worlds main economies monetarists would argue that this also explains why it has been a period of recession in the us and uk and of slowdown in most of the other big countries particularly significant has been the decline in the yearonyear rates of growth of us m2 the countrys most closely watched index of broad money the yearonyear rates of growth of broad money also fell sharply in the uk although they have remained very high by any other countrys standards under the ruthless guidance of mr yasushi mieno governor of the bank of japan the yearonyear rate of growth of japans m2 plus certificates of deposit cds has halved accompanied by the stock market crash whose effect appears in the rise in the yield on equities france too has seen a slowdown in the growth of broad money since early 1990 and a more rapid slowing still in the growth of narrow money for its part italy has avoided a decline in the growth rate of broad money although the yearonyear growth rates of narrow money have fallen the main exception to the general trends is germany not only because of the direct effects of economic and monetary union last july when dmark monetary stocks jumped by about 15 per cent driven along by unification even the growth rates of the monetary stocks in west germany did not fall in 1990 as in other big countries although they did not accelerate significantly either whether the monetary expansion that followed unification will prove inflationary is uncertain depending as it does on economic behaviour in east germany but unification has already had an important effect on german monetary conditions and on convergence within the european community via the interest rate as the chart shows longterm rates of interest have converged among the four large economies in the ec this matters because the german government has stated that interest rate convergence is one of the conditions for movement to economic and monetary union in the ec arguing that it would also indicate convergence of longterm inflationary expectations yet the marked convergence that can be seen in the chart is a result of the virtue of the other three only to a modest degree at least over the past five years it is also a reflection of doubts about germany where the longterm nominal rate of interest has risen by 2 percentage points above its level in 1988 whether this increase reflects higher inflationary expectations or higher real interest rates within an imperfectly integrated global capital market it has done far more for interest rate convergence than lower rates in the other countries all this emerges from the third table in our new series of indicators for the six largest industrial countries which follows the national accounts april 8 1991 and balance of payments april 15 1991 the table presents the most broadly watched monetary aggregates and interest rate series in each of these six countries the narrow measures of money supply m0 and m1 include highly liquid generally noninterest bearing assets while the broader measures m2 m3 and m4 include assets that are likely to be used as a means of saving as well in the us the federal reserve has argued that the longrun growth of m2 should approximately equal the trend growth in output if price stability is to be achieved m2 has remained within its target range of 37 per cent in both 1989 and 1990 while the provisional target for 1991 has been reduced to 2 12 6 12 per cent meanwhile the bank of japan has announced a projection of 8 per cent growth for m2 plus cds in the year to the first quarter of 1991 a forecast that seems eminently reasonable abstracting from the oneoff impact of german monetary union the bundesbanks 1991 target for the growth of allgerman m3 is 46 per cent according to the bundesbanks own calculations not reported in the table growth of allgerman m3 between the fourth quarter of 1990 and february 1991 on an annualised basis was 35 per cent this is below the official target range although it is expected to rise once more meanwhile growth of allgerman m1 between november 1990 and february 1991 was 61 per cent for 1991 the table shows monthonmonth growth rates for allgerman money starting with january 1991 over december 1990 for ec member countries other than germany the principal monetary indicator is the exchange rate against the dmark within the exchange rate mechanism of the european monetary system in the case of the uk for example the financial statement and budget report released at the time of the march budget states that interest rate decisions must now be set consistently with keeping sterling within its announced bands but some countries have supplementary monetary targets like the bundesbank the banque de france has chosen m3 as its target indicator its range being 57 per cent marginally less expansive than the growth of 85 per cent between 1989 and 1990 in the uk by contrast the extraordinarily rapid growth of broad money led the authorities to abandon it in the mid1980s the target is m0 instead which is almost entirely cash in circulation the current aim growth of 04 per cent in the financial year starting april 1991 is fully consistent with recent performance
