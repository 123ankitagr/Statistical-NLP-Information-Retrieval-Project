president george bush yesterday floated the idea of using a basket of major commodities as an indicator of currency values and an aid to restoring stability in the foreign exchange markets we believe it can be useful in strengthening the co-ordination process to more intensely utilise an economic indicator that compares the relationship among our currencies and a basket of commodities including gold mr bush said the idea was aired at a reception held yesterday evening at the white house for ministers attending the annual meetings of the international monetary fund mr bush emphasised that the commodity basket was just a suggestion for improving international economic co-ordination and could serve as an independent reference point for our multilateral surveillance process but the idea especially with the inclusion of gold among the commodities carries an echo of the old gold standard which pegged exchange rates up until the 1930 s economists at the federal reserve board the us central bank have pointed out some of the difficulties involved in using commodity prices as a reference for economic policy while commodity prices contain valuable information for the policy-maker whether they belong at the centre of policy implementation remains to be proven commented mr donald kohn director of the fed's monetary affairs division at a conference three years ago mr kohn pointed out that one has to establish a target level for commodity prices and this can be a tricky exercise for rising or falling commodity prices can indicate different policy responses depending on the level of those prices ultimately one suspects commodity prices will take their place in that eclectic mix of indicators that have keyed policy recently mr kohn said president bush's proposal bears all the hand prints of mr james baker his chief of staff indeed mr bush's speech was written by mr robert zoellick one of mr baker's closest aides when mr baker was treasury secretary in the late 1980 s he put forward an identical proposal to link currencies to a commodity basket including gold at that time the proposal came to nothing however any move to link currencies albeit indirectly with gold is likely to prove popular with the right wing of the republican party many of whom hanker after the stability of the gold standard of pre-first world war years such ideas also have a following in the us federal reserve where mr wayne angell one of the governors has long been an advocate of a commodity link for currencies it is unlikely that the idea will gain support with the main trading partners of the us a senior official of the bundesbank the german central bank said last night that he was sceptical about such a suggestion one european monetary official dismissed the notion as an election ploy
