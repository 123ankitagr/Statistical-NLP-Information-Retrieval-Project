Cal State Long Beach was playing its second consecutive game against a top-10 opponent , the defending NCAA champion -- one that had already lost its opener , badly . So it was no surprise that probability caught up with the 49ers at Long Beach . Stanford came back from a 10-point first-half deficit to win its first game of the season , 79-72 . The Cardinal had lost by 15 points last week to No . 6 Tennessee and the 49ers had upset No . 7 Texas , 80-74 . `` Personally , I think this game was won in practice this week , '' Stanford Coach Tara VanDerveer said . `` We were embarrassed last week in Tennessee . I saw a different commitment from everybody . '' Said Long Beach Coach Joan Bonvicini : `` I was disappointed in our turnovers , which I think doubled in the second half ( the 49ers had 13 in each half ) . We outrebounded them , 67-35 -- that 's crazy . '' So thought the screaming crowd of 1,749 , who watched as the Cardinal , sparked by the inside play of forward Julie Zeilstra , tied the game , 43-43 , with 16:33 remaining after trailing , 41-36 , at halftime . Stanford came back by applying more pressure in the second half , thus effectively shutting down the 49er fast break , which VanDerveer calls `` the best in the game . '' Sophomore guard Molly Goodenbour -- who scored a career-high 14 points -- made the first of three key three-point baskets with 13:46 to go , and the Cardinal led the rest of the game . Zeilstra led all scorers with 22 points . Center Val Whiting had 17 points and nine rebounds . Long Beach was led by guard Trise Jackson with 19 points . Penny Moore had 16 rebounds and Kari Parriott had 14 .
