Aegon , the Dutch insurance group , has decided to withdraw from the Belgian market and sell its insurance activities there to Almanij-Kredietbank , the Belgian savings bank group , writes Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam . Neither company would disclose the price commanded by Aegon 's Belgian insurance business , which generates annual premium income of around BFr3.5bn ( Dollars 95m ) . The transaction will more than double Almanij 's premium income from insurance activities to BFr8bn . Aegon said it was withdrawing from Belgium because of the absence of expansion opportunities and the fact that its insurance activities lacked the necessary critical mass .
