the worldwide telephone network has been described as the biggest machine ever built and has certainly brought about some of the biggest changes in human existence this century it now has a rapidly growing rival the worldwide internet the internet is not a single network it is the biggest collection of computer networks ever linked together it connects around a million machines and new subscribers are joining at a rate of 100000 per month a growth of ten per cent each month like the phone network internet gives global connectivity access to any other machine connected to the system this gives the equivalent of a facsimile connection direct to any other user but computers in contact can offer further services from electronic mail onwards despite this few people have heard of the internet and business users are only just beginning to exploit it as a resource the first commercial services in the uk began in 1992 and have grown rapidly pipex run by unipalm of cambridge with a service that costs from pounds 2000 to pounds 10000 per year is taking pounds 100000 each month in subscription fees and has 78 subscribers each pipex subscriber gets a connection to their office and can link their whole internal network to the worldwide internet one of internets great advantages over other services such as x25 is the fact that internet protocols are the same as those used on many local area networks so far pipex subscribers include such companies as barclays bank eagle star guardian royal exchange powergen the british library and city firms such as trygghansa many people in these companies use internet without realising it on a smaller scale demon internet services offers a simpler connection for home users and smaller businesses at a cost of pounds 10 a month the service started as a sideline in june 1992 when software house demon systems decided to spread the cost of its own internet connection we planned to get 200 to 400 people says grahame davis of demon internet services weve now got 750 people and that is rising at about 100 per month if this continues the service will have to be turned into a fullyfledged line of business or sold off other ways into the internet include gateways available from several bulletin boards such as compulink information exchange cix and mail services such as compuserve most of these will forward electronic mail but some give access to other internet services internet has been hidden from view because it was developed for academic traffic and first boomed in linking research workers it is also based on de facto standard protocols which are out of favour in official circles the internet began with the us department of defenses arpanet which began with four machines in 1969 during the 1970s arpanet was linked with other networks and developed its own standard protocols called tcpip other protocols including the osi standards were used on the nets but only experimentally more and more networks joined the internet during the 1980s europe was slowest to adopt the service possibly due to official pressure to adopt services which use the rival osi protocols strangely the internet was developed with us public money despite the fact that north america also has an osi policy much of the funding came indirectly through researchers salaries in 1992 control of the internet and its protocols passed from a selfappointed committee to a new body called the internet society in a bid to make the internet more acceptable in official circles the society also plans to raise development funds for the internet in the meantime the growth of the internet may bring its own problems as its exponential growth continues it will have to create new addresses the electronic telephone numbers assigned to each system on the network with telephone numbers this is done by adding extra digits as in londons recent change from 01 to 071081 and the extra 1 soon to appear in all uk phone numbers on a network the solution is similar however there are technical and political dimensions to the situation the internet protocols are old and a change of addressing would be a good time to introduce new versions of them this has sparked an argument over which protocols to use and how to structure addresses the internet society is taking the matter seriously but some internet promoters believe it has been blown out of proportion the issue has become an opportunity for some unscrupulous people to sow doubt about the internet says mr dawe the internet is adapting to the continued tidal wave of users the problem has been well forecast and there will be minimal disruption caused osi protocols have been suggested notably by richard des jardins a lecturer and consultant based in washington dc and one of the original architects of osi he believes that governments and the phone companies will create a parallel osibased internet why let a second internet get started even if the tcpip internet is dominant the only interests that would be served would be the hardliners on both sides and the vendors who make money on unnecessary duality if the internet adopted the osi protocols alongside its own it would be a basis for an international dialtone claims dr desjardins the alternative is the internet equivalent of one half of the world using one electrical power standard and the other half using a different and incompatible standard and trying to plug into each other the internet community do not see it that way they object that the protocols are too heavyweight they are not being run over users internal networks so the solution would destroy the homogeneity currently available and says peter dawe of unipalm the system is too complex osi also allows too many addresses enough to address every single particle in the universe individually in the shortterm the internet has come up with a system to redistribute the existing addresses and get more use from them in the next two years the internet society will choose a new protocol osi or not which will run alongside the existing internet the two networks will run concurrently and transparently says mr dawe over time systems will phase over to the new one whatever the solution to the technical issues the internet seems set to keep growing it is a demonstration of what can be achieved with a simple practical approach to networking and an example of how to use government money in a wellcontrolled project the internet is going ballistic says dan lynch president of interop which organises events for the internet community it can not survive technically much longer without some strong central worldwide operational collective that sorts out routing and directory service issues i have hoped that the phone companies of the world would figure out how great an opportunity they have to provide these services but thus far they have squandered their lead but someone will get it together there are just too many trillions of marks to be made cix is on tel 081 390 8446 unipalmpipex is on 0223 420002 demon internet services is on 081 349 0063
