A message for Madge Schaefer : `` Your spitefulness and pettiness are showing . '' You apparently do not understand why you really lost your election . You blame it on `` one issue radicals . '' You are wrong . The real reason you lost is that you spent the past several years not representing the people of your district , on this and other issues . You have done a very good job of representing a few rather than the majority . You have represented outside interests rather than those of your own constituents . You took over Oak Park 's MAC , giving positions on that board to the most wealthy in the community , breaking with a long tradition of electing members , common human decency and the concept of equal representation . You consistently push for big money land development interests , such as David Murdoch , Bob Hope and Potomac Investment Associates , a Maryland-based firm . My neighbors and I did not vote against you because of one issue politics . We voted against you because you have refused to represent us as our supervisor . Yes , I oppose the changes being proposed to the county general plan that would allow big outside interests to destroy my neighborhood . But I did not vote against you because of just that one issue . Had you represented my family and me better on many other issues , I might have voted for you in spite of this one issue , taking it as a fair disagreement . I voted against you because you chose to represent the interests of others . If you want to serve outsiders like Potomac Investment Associates , then please , Ms. Schaefer , move to Maryland and run for election there . In the final days of your term , just once really represent your constituents rather than outside interests . Dr. DANIEL JORDAN Agoura
