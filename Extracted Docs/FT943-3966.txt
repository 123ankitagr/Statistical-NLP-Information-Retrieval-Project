japanese weekend newspapers have an endearing fondness for parish-pump news as if there were an unwritten rule against startling exhausted salaryman readers during days off as always on a sunday the japan times decorates its front page with a colour photograph of the flower of the week yesterday a wild clematis the daily yomiuri leads its columns with a mild crisis in the prison service caused by a shortage of prison library books written in farsi for the growing number of iranian inmates on the sports pages the top story in both papers is the failure of the latest attempt to solve the us professional baseball strike this is a remarkable story to japanese readers few of whom would ever dream of going on strike let alone over a game where honour is at stake no labour troubles in japanese baseball where ichiro suzuki of the orix blue wave made his 185 th hit of the season on saturday well on the way to beating the 44-year japanese record of 191 hits in a season established by the late fumio fujimara of the hanshin tigers what is more fujimara had the benefit of a 140-game season 10 games more than allowed to suzuki in today's pacific league inside the japan times main editorial turns its back on international affairs despite the fact that this has been an interesting week with a nasty row between china and taiwan over whether taiwanese president lee teng-hui should accept an invitation to the asian games in hiroshima early next month instead the japan times offers its collective wisdom on why the government should be nicer to the aged no disrespect intended to the septuagenarian prime minister tomiichi murayama the paper's editor is moved by the latest annual age count from the health and welfare ministry which shows that japan has a record 5,593 centenarians an increase of 791 on last year the grey wave is a big story in japan this is not just because the average lifespan is the longest in the world at 76 years for men and 82 for women japan's elderly are also its biggest national headache the proportion of pensioners is rising faster than anywhere else in the world with horrendous consequences for the government's finances the japan times offers no solutions but instead ticks off council workers in saitama prefecture for disconnecting a 79-year-old lady's air-conditioning on the grounds that it was an expensive luxury for someone on welfare assistance japan has had its hottest summer for decades and even now the temperatures are still in the 30 s so it was no surprise that the poor old woman ended up in hospital suffering from dehydration the whole country will have a chance to draw the moral from this sad tale at leisure on thursday respect for the aged day one of japan's 14 national holidays not that the rest of world has completely passed the weekend press by simply that the international stories tend to be treated with less interest with the perennial exception of news about the us the focal centre of japan's view of the outside world nowhere in the press for example is it possible to find a word of advice on how mr murayama should wriggle out of the diplomatic embarrassment presented by mr lee's possible attendance at the asian games among the sports papers chunichi sport drily points out that the matter is too political to be handled by the games organisers daily sport reports without comment a government official's remark that china with which japan has diplomatic relations is more important than taiwan with which it has no formal ties the nikkei weekly does offer the prime minister some advice not on how to resolve the games dilemma but on how to minimise the damage it counsels mr murayama to cancel a planned official visit to china next month and stay at home another reason not go is that mr murayama risks offending the taiwanese by being in beijing on october 10, taiwan's politically sensitive national day why is it so hard for japan to choose between china and taiwan it may be something to do with the growing number of japanese businesses opening up in taiwan the latest reported last week being fuji bank having to make hard choices also interferes with tokyo's policy of keeping as many friends as possible in asia no wonder the japanese press prefers to stay on the sidelines of the diplomatic fracas over the asian games choosing the flower of the week is far more civilised
