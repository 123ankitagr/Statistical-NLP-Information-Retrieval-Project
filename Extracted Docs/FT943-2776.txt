Thousands of turbot at an experimental fish farm on the island of Gigha , off the coast of Argyll , are to be killed after government officials confirmed they were suffering from a fish disease which has not been recorded in the British Isles before . The fish are affected with viral haemorrhagic septicaemia ( VHS ) , a disease which UK and European Union legislation requires to be eradicated if its breaks out . The disease is said to be endemic on the Continent . The affected fish farm has been placed under quarantine for killing and clearance , and movement of fish from a salmon farm on the island has been banned . The disease was discovered last week at the turbot farm which is owned by the McConnell Salmon company . Its confirmation as VHS has alarmed fish farmers in Scotland , who fear that they could be affected by the disease or suffer from bad publicity . The Ministry of Agriculture says VHS can affect salmon , rainbow trout , brown trout , grayling and other species . However , Mr David Windmill , managing director of McConnell Salmon , said the company had found no evidence in the scientific literature of VHS affecting salmon , which make up the majority of fish farmed in Scotland . Mr Seumas McSporran , sub-postmaster on Gigha , which has a population of 120 , said : 'It would be a crisis for us if both the fish farms had to close . ' The turbot farm , which has been operating for a year in its present form , contains about 200,000 turbot , worth about Pounds 500,000 . McConnell Salmon started the operation to see whether turbot could be farmed as successfully as salmon . Mr Windmill thought the disease could have reached the fish through their moist feed .
