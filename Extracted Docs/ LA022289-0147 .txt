Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke overcame two last-minute efforts to block him from taking his newly won seat in the Legislature today and was sworn in as a member of the Louisiana House . Rep. Odon Bacquet objected to letting Republican Duke take his seat , claiming that he did not meet the residency requirement , but Bacquet 's tactic failed when the House voted 69-33 to table his motion . Duke , who now heads the National Assn . for the Advancement of White People , then was sworn in . Outside the Capitol , about 25 students -- both black and white -- chanted `` Do n't seat Duke , keep Duke out . '' Just before the House met , a state district judge in Metairie , which includes Duke 's district , refused a request by defeated House candidate John Treen for a restraining order to prevent his taking the seat . Treen appealed to the state Supreme Court .
