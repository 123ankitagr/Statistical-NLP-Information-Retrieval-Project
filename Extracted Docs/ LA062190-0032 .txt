Do n't blink , or you 'll miss this year 's apricots . The short season also accounts for the fact that there are so few recipes calling for fresh apricots ; they 're hardly around long enough to think of how to cook them . Fanny Farmer did , however , manage to dash off this dessert , made with a puree of fresh apricots that serves well as a pie filling or a topping for ice cream , yogurt or pancakes . APRICOT WHIP 1 cup fresh apricots , pitted , sliced thin , but not peeled 1/4 cup sugar or mild honey 2 teaspoons lemon juice Dash salt 3 egg whites Simmer apricots in water to cover 10 minutes .
