NORTH and South Korea yesterday held their first consultations since January as Pyongyang faced a possible mid-October deadline to resolve the issue of nuclear inspections . North Korea proposed the meeting after the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) last week declared Pyongyang was violating the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by not allowing inspections of nuclear facilities . Mr Han Sung-joo , the South Korean foreign minister , has suggested that North Korea has only about two weeks to achieve progress in nuclear inspection talks with the IAEA and South Korea before the issue is transferred to the UN Security Council , which could impose economic sanctions . But North Korea refused to make concessions at yesterday 's meeting at the truce village of Panmunjom , which was called to discuss the exchange of presidential special envoys . Pyongyang demanded that South Korea halt joint military exercises with the US and stop seeking international support in dealing with the North Korean nuclear issue before the meeting of presidential envoys took place . Seoul has rejected those conditions unless Pyongyang first agrees to allow full nuclear inspections by both the IAEA and South Korea . South Korea also proposed the presidential representatives should first discuss the nuclear issue before other bilateral matters are negotiated .
