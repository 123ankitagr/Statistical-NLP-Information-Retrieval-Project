San Gabriel Valley residents living near the controversial BKK Corp. landfill face a risk of contracting cancer that is slightly above the U.S. average , according to a recently completed health-risk assessment by USC and the state Department of Health Services . However , researchers also concluded that the cancer rate for those living around the West Covina landfill was essentially the same as for Los Angeles County overall . The studies involved 100,000 residents who lived around the landfill from 1972 to 1982 , when it was one of the state 's principal toxic waste disposal sites . The heightened risk translates into an additional 2 people out of 100,000 who are likely to develop cancer as a result of the presence of vinyl chloride , a carcinogen present in the air , soil and water around the landfill , which is now closed to toxic waste . About 33,000 people in the study area would be expected to contract cancer regardless of the landfill 's proximity , researchers said .
