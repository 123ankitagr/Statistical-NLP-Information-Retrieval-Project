electronics transistor age 1950s very people direct personal experience genetic medicine research efforts hundreds laboratories around world dimly understood world outside the genetic revolution therefore made little impact public imagination says dr steve jones head genetics department university college london tried bring home implications recent reith lectures bbc radio but going dramatic effect many people you able get good idea going die positive know diseases risk avoid research coordinated international programme human genome mapping project total expenditure estimated dollars 3bn pounds 16bn next 15 years since gene mapping started early 1970s pace accelerated rapidly scientists located 2700 genes including responsible common inherited diseases cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy haemophilia gender gene determines whether embryo becomes boy girl practical uses new genetic knowledge fall two broad categories testing screening discover whether individual carrying particular genes therapy change persons genes both bring promise immense medical benefits balanced terrifying possibilities abuse the embarrassing record predecessors 1920s 1930s willing advocate eugenics racial purity increased reluctance todays researchers speak publicly human genetic engineering there astonishing shift attitude last 50 years jones observes in 1930s genetics series prejudices information effectively zero scientific literature full proposals eugenics now gaining knowledge improve human race people dont want think prenatal testing already available eighth week pregnancy several disorders caused single genetic defects including cystic fibrosis phenylketonuria muscular dystrophy thalassaemia if defective gene present mother offered abortion extensive genetic testing thalassaemia severe form anaemia common mediterranean region greatly reduced incidence disease for opposed abortion form preventative medicine unacceptable but medical profession regards morally equivalent great practical improvement amniocentesis cruder limited nongenetic test foetal abnormalities offered older mothers at time foundations laid genetic screening general population the uk medical research council sponsoring five trials screening cystic fibrosis uks common serious inherited disease clogs lungs thick mucus kills sufferers age 30 participants simply wash mouths provide enough cells test defective gene we examining whether deliver acceptable model mass screening says dr david brock professor human genetics edinburgh university any type screening capacity disturb well reassure being told carrier cf gene may quite upsetting people however carefully prepared those taking tests told people carrying one copy defective gene quite healthy marry someone defect children one four chance developing cystic fibrosis as genes identified ethical problems multiply the main medical problems western society cancer heart disease mental illness result complicated interaction genetic environmental factors genetic testing may reveal unusual susceptibility alcoholism schizophrenia heart attack lung cancer predictions may uncertain a pregnant woman told unambiguously baby suffer cystic fibrosis likely opt abortion but decision make example told one five chance baby growing schizophrenic for adults genetic testing could throw disturbing uncertainties if full printout genes us would discover carried several potentially lethal recessive genes effect unless parent similar gene on hand genetic printout properly interpreted would give everyone personal guide activities

much persuasive todays generalised dos donts but unless social attitudes legal framework change disincentives taking genetic tests could formidable those turned bad genes could face discrimination access health life insurance education even employment information made available people it easy imagine computer technology including artificial intelligence combined genetic screening draw conclusions peoples suitability particular jobs careers large companies may build genetic database staff discover employees certain gene combinations well others badly that might sound alarming echo huxleys brave new world route better career counselling depending point view even deepest personal relationships could influenced genetic testing disease compatibility accepted cultures precursor marriage many researchers agree sir walter bodmer director imperial cancer research fund president international human genome mapping organisation new legal framework needed genetic medicine but interested parties nowhere near reaching agreement content life insurance executives example already objected idea proposed geneticists companies banned discriminating known carriers genetic disease the need legislation become greater genetic screening voluntary todays experimental programmes eventually becomes compulsory in long run said baroness warnock moral philosopher chaired highly influential committee inquiry human fertilisation seems inevitable everyone obliged submit least compulsory screening genetic testing become much appealing researchers discover correct defects discovered gene therapy pioneered us involves introducing nondefective genes particular cells replace ones carrying disease the first patient fouryearold american girl kept apart children one defective gene immune system meant natural protection infection in september 1990 given transfusion billion blood cells copies correct gene added her immune defences strong enough attend school since half dozen gene therapy studies got way us european researchers expect launch trials last month uk governments committee ethics gene therapy chaired sir cecil clothier distinguished lawyer recommended approval gene therapy trials cystic fibrosis one important targets gene therapy research sides atlantic animal tests potential treatments already way scientists us national institutes health used genetically altered virus carry correctly functioning copies cftr gene defective cystic fibrosis patients lungs laboratory rats if technique works monkeys trials human gene therapy cystic fibrosis could start soon 1993 all experiments involve somatic gene therapy this corrects defect adding new genes cells needed example bone marrow lungs genetic change passed patients offspring there widespread agreement said lady warnock therapy open moral objection indeed sir cecil clothier says none religious groups christian moslem jewish giving evidence committee objected somatic gene therapy but germ line gene therapy would affect future generations generally regarded today medically unpredictable ethically unacceptable it unlikely approved anywhere world least years an experimental procedure equivalent germ line therapy used make transgenic animals example sheep produce valuable human proteins milk but technique involves injecting genes newly fertilised embryos crude use humans there way controlling many copies new genes taken directing incorporated embryos existing genetic material however scientists develop precise technique eliminating defective gene replacing correct copy germ line gene therapy seem irresistible if example became possible safely eradicate cystic fibrosis ever would seem absurd screen generation defective gene the question whether would taken first step slippery slope leading eventually eradication inherited diseases genetic enhancement soughtafter traits intelligence beauty athletic prowess improving mankind may seem enticing prospect but lady warnock said we fear without reason one day power might exercised benevolent doctors political tyrants would use us ends
