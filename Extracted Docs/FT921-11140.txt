of all the 20 th century's scientific revolutions the one with the greatest potential to transform life is the unravelling of the secrets of human genes within 15 years scientists expect to have decoded all of the 100,000 genes which are the blueprint for individual development from the foetus until old age this information encoded chemically in every living cell is stored in spiral ribbons of dna deoxyribonucleic acid which is analogous to computer tapes decoding them could confer an almost godlike power to foresee and to change an individual's destiny the question whether this power will be used for good or ill raises deep moral issues which will result in fierce debate as the technology improves the practical development of genetics is however no more advanced than electronics was in the transistor age of the 1950 s very few people have had direct personal experience of genetic medicine and research efforts in hundreds of laboratories around the world are dimly understood in the world outside the genetic revolution has therefore made little impact on the public imagination says dr steve jones head of the genetics department at university college london who tried to bring home its implications in his recent reith lectures on bbc radio but it is going to have a dramatic effect on many people you will be able to get a good idea of what you are going to die from and when or to be more positive to know what diseases you are at risk from so that you can avoid them research is coordinated through an international programme the human genome mapping project with total expenditure estimated at dollars 3 bn pounds 1.6 bn over the next 15 years since gene mapping started in the early 1970 s the pace has accelerated rapidly scientists have now located about 2,700 genes including those responsible for common inherited diseases such as cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy and haemophilia and the gender gene which determines whether the embryo becomes a boy or girl practical uses of the new genetic knowledge fall into two broad categories testing or screening to discover whether an individual is carrying particular genes and therapy to change a person's genes both bring the promise of immense medical benefits balanced by terrifying possibilities for abuse the embarrassing record of some of their predecessors in the 1920 s and 1930 s who were only too willing to advocate eugenics and racial purity has increased the reluctance of today's researchers to speak publicly about human genetic engineering there has been an astonishing shift of attitude over the last 50 years jones observes in the 1930 s when genetics was a series of prejudices and our information was effectively zero the scientific literature was full of proposals for eugenics now that we are gaining the knowledge to improve the human race people don't want to think about it pre-natal testing is already available in about the eighth week of pregnancy for several disorders caused by single genetic defects including cystic fibrosis phenylketonuria muscular dystrophy and thalassaemia if the defective gene is present the mother is offered an abortion extensive genetic testing for thalassaemia a severe form of anaemia common in the mediterranean region has greatly reduced the incidence of this disease for those opposed to abortion this form of preventative medicine is unacceptable but the medical profession regards it as morally equivalent to and a great practical improvement on amniocentesis a cruder and more limited non-genetic test for foetal abnormalities which is offered to older mothers at the same time foundations are being laid for genetic screening of the general population the uk medical research council is sponsoring five trials of screening for cystic fibrosis the uk's most common serious inherited disease which clogs the lungs with a thick mucus and kills most sufferers before the age of 30 participants simply have to wash out their mouths to provide enough cells to test for the defective gene we are examining whether we can deliver an acceptable model of mass screening says dr david brock professor of human genetics at edinburgh university any type of screening has the capacity to disturb as well as reassure being told that they are a carrier of a cf gene may be quite upsetting to some people however carefully they have been prepared those taking the tests are told that people carrying one copy of the defective gene are quite healthy but if they marry someone with the same defect the children will have a one in four chance of developing cystic fibrosis as more genes are identified such ethical problems will multiply the main medical problems of western society cancer heart disease and mental illness result from a complicated interaction between genetic and environmental factors genetic testing may reveal an unusual susceptibility to alcoholism or schizophrenia heart attack or lung cancer but predictions may be uncertain a pregnant woman told unambiguously that her baby will suffer from cystic fibrosis is likely to opt for abortion but what decision will she make if for example she is told there is a one in five chance of the baby growing up schizophrenic for adults genetic testing could throw up disturbing uncertainties if we had a full print-out of our genes all of us would discover that we carried several potentially lethal recessive genes which have no effect unless the other parent has a similar gene on the other hand a genetic print-out properly interpreted would give everyone a personal guide as to which activities could be harmful and which might be safely indulged you might be told for example that you can eat fatty foods freely having no disposition to heart disease or bowel cancer but must avoid alcohol because you are susceptible to alcoholism advice based on one's own gene pattern could be much more persuasive than today's generalised do's and don'ts but unless social attitudes and the legal framework change the disincentives to taking genetic tests could be formidable those who turned out to have bad genes could face discrimination in access to health and life insurance education and even employment if the information were made available to other people it is easy to imagine computer technology including artificial intelligence being combined with genetic screening to draw conclusions about people's suitability for particular jobs or careers large companies may build up a genetic database of their staff and discover that employees with certain gene combinations do well and others do badly that might sound an alarming echo of huxley's brave new world or a route to better career counselling depending on the point of view even the deepest personal relationships could be influenced if genetic testing for disease or compatibility were accepted in some cultures as a precursor of marriage many researchers agree with sir walter bodmer director of the imperial cancer research fund and president of the international human genome mapping organisation that a new legal framework is needed for genetic medicine but the interested parties are nowhere near reaching agreement about its content life insurance executives for example have already objected to the idea proposed by some geneticists that companies should banned from discriminating against known carriers of genetic disease the need for legislation will become all the greater if genetic screening voluntary in today's experimental programmes eventually becomes compulsory in the long run said baroness warnock the moral philosopher who chaired the highly influential committee of inquiry into human fertilisation it seems to me inevitable that everyone will be obliged to submit to at least some compulsory screening genetic testing will become much more appealing as researchers discover how to correct the defects discovered gene therapy which has been pioneered in the us involves introducing non-defective genes into particular cells to replace the ones carrying the disease the first patient was a four-year-old american girl who had to be kept apart from other children because one defective gene in her immune system meant that she had no natural protection against infection in september 1990 she was given a transfusion of about a billion of her own blood cells to which copies of the correct gene had been added her immune defences are now strong enough for her to attend school since then half a dozen other gene therapy studies have got under way in the us and european researchers expect to launch their own trials last month the uk government's committee on the ethics of gene therapy chaired by sir cecil clothier the distinguished lawyer recommended approval for gene therapy trials cystic fibrosis is one of the most important targets for gene therapy research on both sides of the atlantic and animal tests of potential treatments are already under way scientists at the us national institutes of health have used a genetically altered virus to carry correctly functioning copies of the cftr gene which is defective in cystic fibrosis patients into the lungs of laboratory rats if the technique works in monkeys too trials of human gene therapy for cystic fibrosis could start as soon as 1993 all these experiments involve somatic gene therapy this corrects the defect by adding new genes to the cells where they are needed for example in the bone marrow or lungs but the genetic change is not passed on to the patient's offspring there is widespread agreement said lady warnock that such therapy is not open to moral objection indeed sir cecil clothier says that none of the religious groups christian moslem and jewish giving evidence to his committee objected to somatic gene therapy but germ line gene therapy which would affect future generations is generally regarded today as medically unpredictable and ethically unacceptable it is unlikely to be approved anywhere in the world at least for a few years an experimental procedure equivalent to germ line therapy is used to make transgenic animals for example sheep which produce valuable human proteins in their milk but the technique which involves injecting genes into newly fertilised embryos is too crude for use in humans there is no way of controlling how many copies of the new genes are taken up nor of directing where they are incorporated in the embryo's existing genetic material however if scientists develop a more precise technique for eliminating a defective gene and replacing it with a correct copy then germ line gene therapy will seem irresistible if for example it became possible safely to eradicate cystic fibrosis for ever it would seem absurd to screen each generation for the defective gene the question then is whether we would have taken the first step down a slippery slope leading eventually from eradication of inherited diseases to genetic enhancement of sought-after traits such as intelligence beauty and athletic prowess improving mankind may seem an enticing prospect but as lady warnock said we all fear and not without reason that one day such power might be exercised not by benevolent doctors but by political tyrants who would use us for their own ends
