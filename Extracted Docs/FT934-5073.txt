the measure student grants are to be cut by 10 per cent a year next year and by similar amounts for the next two years but the total of grant and loan is to increase by 4 per cent next year in detail this measure speeds up the process of transferring the cost of higher education from the state to individuals the proportion of students income which has to be borrowed will increase dramatically the exact figures for next years grants and loans have not yet been released but rough figures can be calculated from the governments announced percentages for example students living in london currently get a grant of pounds 2845 and can borrow up to pounds 940 from the student loans company or pounds 685 in their final year next year the grant will be cut by 10 per cent to about pounds 2560 and the maximum loan will increase to about pounds 1375 or pounds 1110 for final year students see the table for details of other areas if as is the governments stated intention the process of cutting the grant by 10 per cent and increasing the loan is continued for the following two years by the academic year 199697 the proportion of grant to loan will be roughly equal the background student loans were introduced in 1990 and grants were frozen at the same time the national union of students says that even students receiving the full grant and taking out the maximum loan now experience a shortfall from real costs of living so students borrow more from other sources such as banks or ask parents for help the budget also cut the amount paid to universities for each students tuition this may prompt some institutions to introduce tuition fees estimated change for student finance 19934 19945 grant loan grant loan pounds pounds pounds pounds london 2845 940 2561 1376 final year 685 1111 elsewhere 2265 800 2039 1149 final year 585 926 at home 1795 640 1616 917 final year 470 740 source estimates based on current grant and loan levels
