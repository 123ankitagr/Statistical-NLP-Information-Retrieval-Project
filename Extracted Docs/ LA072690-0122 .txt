california and utah researchers have succeeded in preventing one form of kidney disease in rats potentially opening the door to prevention of kidney failure in humans the disease called glomerulonephritis is one of the most common causes of chronic kidney failure afflicting as many as 100000 americans each year once the kidney fails the patients must either receive a transplant or remain on dialysis for the rest of their lives researchers from the university of utah and the la jolla cancer research foundation report today in the british journal nature that glomerulonephritis in the rats is caused by excess concentrations of a hormone called transforming growth factorbeta tgfb they found that specialized antibodies can be used to remove the hormone from the blood of the animals and thereby prevent the onset of the disease but utah nephrologist wayne border cautioned that it could be many years before the proposed therapy could be used in humans for one thing the recently discovered tgfb has not yet been linked to kidney disease in humans although he said it would be incredible if it werent also playing an important role in man researchers have not shown in animal experiments that the therapy can halt the disease process once it has begun he added but testtube experiments indicate that it can this important observation opens the door to the treatment of humans said dr saulo klahr of the washington university school of medicine president of the national kidney foundation healthy kidneys act as filters that remove both excess water and cellular wastes from blood when the kidneys fail an individual will die of poisoning within days unless those wastes are removed artificially by dialysis more than 130000 americans undergo dialysis routinely to maintain their health the filtering is carried out within the kidney by small units called glomeruli kidney disease occurs when the glomeruli become clogged by abnormally large amounts of a material called extracellular matrix a fibrous meshwork of proteins and other materials this scarring and clogging can be produced by diabetes high blood pressure and glomerulonephritis in which the immune system attacks the glomeruli often as the aftereffect of an infection physicians do not know the precise mechanism by which the damage occurs and no effective therapy exists to prevent or halt the scarring scientists study glomerulonephritis in rats by injecting a protein that attacks cells in the glomeruli damaging them and inducing the formation of extracellular matrix studying this phenomenon border and cellular biologist erkki ruoslahti of the la jolla foundation discovered that the formation of the matrix was triggered by tgfb which was released when the kidney cells were damaged the researchers then prepared antibodies to the hormone and injected them into 15 rats at the same time they injected the protein that produces the disease the rats also received daily injections of the the antitgfb antibody on each of the next six days after seven days the researchers examined the rats that received the antitgfb antibody and found that their glomeruli were normal border said indicating that disease had been prevented in contrast the glomeruli of 15 control animals who were given only the diseaseproducing protein showed marked scarring and inflammation so far there is no evidence that tgfb plays a similar role in glomerulonephritis in humans but our paper is the first to describe a link to tgfb in kidney disease border said so no one has looked for it before they are now collecting human blood samples to look for the hormone he said and they are also conducting studies to determine if the antitgfb antibodies can halt the disease process once it has been initiated meanwhile ruoslahti and his colleagues in la jolla have discovered a naturally occurring protein called decorin that in the test tube binds to tgfb and neutralizes its activity in much the same way that the antibody does researchers at telios pharmaceuticals of la jolla are developing techniques to produce large quantities of decorin in order to study its potential therapeutic use the research may have other applications as well ruoslahti said tgfb may be involved in other diseases where excess scarring occurs such as lung disease and it may play a role in the process by which cancer cells from a tumor metastasize invading other parts of the body developing the ability to interfere with tgfb he said might thus have therapeutic potential in those disorders as well maugh reported from los angeles and monroe reported from san diego background kidney disease caused by diabetes high blood pressure and glomerulonephritis affects as many as 100000 americans a year the only treatments are dialysis and kidney transplants the number of americans on dialysis has been growing about 10 a year reaching 130000 in 1989 and costing the federal government about $ 25 billion a year
