A RUN-OFF for the vacant place on Labour 's shadow cabinet will be held next Wednesday , as just one vote separated the two front runners , Mr Ron Davies and Mr George Robertson , in yesterday 's first ballot . Mr Davies , who polled 78 votes to Mr Robertson 's 77 , is favourite for the post , having come closest of the contenders to winning a place on the shadow cabinet team when the main elections were held in the summer . But the political emphasis on Europe in recent weeks has boosted the profile of Mr Robertson , the party 's European affairs spokesman . The other contenders were Mr Tony Banks , the opposition spokesman on London , who won 34 votes , and Ms Clare Short , a member of the frontbench environment team , who scored 27 . They drop out of the next round , and their support is thought likely to go to Mr Davies , as Mr Robertson - thought to be Mr John Smith 's preference - is the only candidate from the right of the party . Mr Davies , Labour 's agriculture spokesman , is no Euro-enthusiast , but is unlikely to take Euro-scepticism to the lengths that led Mr Bryan Gould to resign from the shadow cabinet , creating the vacancy . Although Mr Gould was shadow heritage secretary , there is no guarantee that the newcomer will take up that post , which is clearly being coveted by existing members of the Labour 's front bench . Next week 's result may turn on how far either of the remaining candidates can mobilise their colleagues : 53 of Labour 's 269 MPs did not bother to vote .
