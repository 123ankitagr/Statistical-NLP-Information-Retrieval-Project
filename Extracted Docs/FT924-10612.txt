a run-off for the vacant place on labour's shadow cabinet will be held next wednesday as just one vote separated the two front runners mr ron davies and mr george robertson in yesterday's first ballot mr davies who polled 78 votes to mr robertson's 77, is favourite for the post having come closest of the contenders to winning a place on the shadow cabinet team when the main elections were held in the summer but the political emphasis on europe in recent weeks has boosted the profile of mr robertson the party's european affairs spokesman the other contenders were mr tony banks the opposition spokesman on london who won 34 votes and ms clare short a member of the frontbench environment team who scored 27 they drop out of the next round and their support is thought likely to go to mr davies as mr robertson thought to be mr john smith's preference is the only candidate from the right of the party mr davies labour's agriculture spokesman is no euro-enthusiast but is unlikely to take euro-scepticism to the lengths that led mr bryan gould to resign from the shadow cabinet creating the vacancy although mr gould was shadow heritage secretary there is no guarantee that the newcomer will take up that post which is clearly being coveted by existing members of the labour's front bench next week's result may turn on how far either of the remaining candidates can mobilise their colleagues 53 of labour's 269 mps did not bother to vote
