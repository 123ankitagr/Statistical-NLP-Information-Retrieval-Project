'' Are you ready Steve ? '' No , Sweet 's original bassist Steve Priest was n't there Wednesday at the Strand when the group played its first Southern California show since 1982 . He and original singer Brian Connolly had the good sense to leave the group years ago after its heyday . But do n't put it past the remaining original members , guitarist Andy Scott and drummer Mick Tucker , to have hired a keyboardist named Steve just so they could re-create that classic `` Are you ready '' intro to Sweet 's best-known song , 1975 's `` Ballroom Blitz . '' The pair certainly showed no other evidence of class Wednesday . Scott and Tucker sported poofy hair and leather duds that would look silly on Sunset Strip kids 20 years their juniors . And with singer Paul Day , bassist Mal McNulty and keyboardist Steve Mann on Wednesday , they played songs that sounded silly 15 years ago . Of course , 15 years ago , that was part of the group 's charm . Looking back , Sweet 's hard-rock-bubblegum style ( one critic termed it `` Bazooka-rock '' ) was the missing link between the 1910 Fruitgum Company and Twisted Sister , a prototype for the '80s pop-metal of Motley Crue , Quiet Riot and Poison . And truth be told , the group 's best songs -- `` Ballroom Blitz , '' `` Action , '' the teasingly bisexual ( though sexist ) `` A.C.D.C . '' -- have weathered better than the band . Any one of them would make a nice hard-rock diversion on Rhino Records ' `` Have a Nice Day '' '70s pop anthologies . But that 's hardly enough to justify Wednesday 's hapless display . Sweet plays tonight at Spice in Hollywood , Saturday at the Bacchanal in San Diego , Sunday at the Coach House in San Juan Capistrano and Monday at the Hop in Riverside . STEVE HOCHMAN
