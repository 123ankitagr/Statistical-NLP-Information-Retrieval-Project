American General Corp. stunned shareholders and one suitor Wednesday by putting itself up for sale , in an auction expected to fetch $ 7 billion for the nation 's fourth-largest insurance company . The company 's stock price jumped sharply higher after the announcement at American General 's annual shareholders meeting , where the anticipated event had been a showdown with hostile suitor Torchmark Corp. Harold S. Hook , American General 's chairman , said the company decided to put itself up for auction because it was vulnerable to a possible takeover at a discount price and wanted to realize the maximum value for its stockholders . American General stock finished up $ 7.50 at $ 47.625 a share as the most actively traded issue on the New York Stock Exchange . Company officials and analysts said they expected the bidding for American General to reach about $ 7 billion , or more than $ 55 per share . Birmingham , Ala.-based Torchmark had made an unsolicited $ 6.34-billion , or $ 50 per share , cash and stock buyout offer for American General in March . But Torchmark later withdrew the offer , opting instead to wage a proxy fight to elect its own five nominees to the 15-member board . Since then each company has been vigorously urging shareholders to support its board nominees .
