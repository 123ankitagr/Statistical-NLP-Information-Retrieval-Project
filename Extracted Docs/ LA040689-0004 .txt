allowing ousted teacher sharon rogers to return to the classroom headmaster timothy burns addressing the parents in an open forum for the first time since rogers was removed from the campus was praised for his courageous stand during the past three weeks in which the private school has been sharply criticized for its response after rogers van exploded in what may have been a terrorist attack one father drew sustained applause and cheers from the several hundred parents when he indicated that school administrators were justified in first worrying about the safety of the children and in now attempting to negotiate a return to the school of the popular fourthgrade teacher im not embarrassed im not embarrassed to be a part of the la jolla country day family he said and im not embarrassed that were trying to keep sharon rogers as part of our facility school spokesman richard roth said rogers did not attend the meeting because the school was unable to assure her safety there as well as that of the parents and faculty but he said a videotape was made of the meeting and that the school plans to send her a copy today exactly how rogers will react to the overwhelming support for burns and the school administration is unclear several sources close to her have described her as very distressed by his decision not to allow her to return to campus for the rest of the school year navy cmdr dave matt dillon who has been in routine contact with rogers and her husband capt will c rogers iii said wednesday that the couple will probably release a statement today describing their feelings about the meeting i told capt rogers about the meeting and he seemed real interested dillon said they probably will have some comment about it sharon rogers a teacher at the private school for 12 years has not returned there since she narrowly escaped injury when a pipe bomb exploded march 10 destroying her van while she was stopped at an intersection en route to the school since then she and her husband have been resettled at a secret location meanwhile federal authorities are continuing to investigate the explosion to determine if it was in retaliation for capt rogers mistaken order last summer aboard the guided missile destroyer vincennes to shoot down an iranian jetliner over the persian gulf burns la jolla country day headmaster for the eight years addressed the crowd wednesday night by defending his and the school boards decision not to allow rogers to return this year he said his paramount concern was the safety of the children he also pointed out that rogers is continuing to receive her salary as she assists her substitute teacher and he said he has presented her two alternative contracts for next school year no substantial threat in both cases he said they clearly say she can return as a teacher if we can verify there is no substantial threat to sharon the school or the children spokesman roth said one contract would allow rogers back on campus if a substantial assurance of safety could be provided by the fbi the naval investigative service and the san diego police department he said the second contract would permit her to return at the discretion of the headmaster roth said the school hopes to have an answer from rogers by april 14 she has yet to sign either proposal and attorneys for both her and the school are now entering the negotiations burns told the parents i want to be both reasonable and fair this is a most unique situation we are in i am waiting to hear a response on one of the contracts he also urged parents to help their children overcome their concerns and fears he said terrorist awareness seminars will be conducted and that continued private security will be provided counseled stockton kids and he said the staff is meeting with a san diego firm that counseled children at a school in stockton where a gunman opened fire jan 17 and killed five students and wounded 29 more we need to get beyond finger pointing in this burns said we need to get beyond name calling we need to get beyond blame this issue needs to be behind us as soon as possible several parents charged that the school has been unduly singled out for criticism even though federal and military security guards will not permit rogers to return to her own home we have to wait for the u s government to give her the assurance that she is free herself one mother said our school needs to wait and see what happens and not rush into this situation lets give her the contract and see what she decides the mother also described how she ran into rogers at a pharmacy and how she was frightened at seeing the teacher surrounded by four security guards in suits and ties and wearing earphones willing to live with it so how do you think your children and my children will react if she returns to school like that she asked but one father said he is willing to live with less than 100 security at the school if it means rogers can return soon and he said he hopes the events of the past several weeks do not make it appear that rogers was flatout fired as rep bill lowery rsan diego and other sources have contended its not like firing the chef and giving him two weeks severance the father said so i cant live with congressmen and the press taking poetic license when they werent in a burning van and theyre not in trouble and theyre not living in secret on a military base that comment too was met by loud applause
