a modest increase in world iron ore consumption is expected next year after a difficult 1992 which has been marked by lower prices weaker demand high investments and declining trade government and industry representatives from 30 countries who met last week in geneva under the auspices of the united nations conference on trade and development agreed that the worst has already passed for the industry in the short term longterm prospects were also brighter with the international iron and steel institute predicting an overall increase in steel consumption to the year 2000 the institute expects a 15 per cent rise in steel demand in 1993 which the experts believe will translate into an increase in demand for iron ore of the order of 1 per cent this compares with a drop in world consumption of 4 per cent in 1991 to 937m tonnes and a further fall in 1992 despite higher demand however the high level of stocks and very low scrap prices will continue to put downward pressure on iron ore prices next year the 1992 slowdown has reflected recession in the big industrialised countries especially japan and germany the two leading iron ore importers crude steel production in the first nine months of 1992 was down 13 per cent in japan and 2 per cent in germany compared with the corresponding period of 1991 however the big fiscal expansion package announced by the japanese government last summer is expected to boost steel output from early next year other asian markets are growing strongly especially china where crude steel production rose by an annualised 14 per cent in the first nine months of this year steel production has also been rising in the us and latin america the main black spot remains eastern europe where crude steel production fell by an annual 16 per cent in januaryseptember 1992 and little improvement is expected in the near term iron ore production in the region is almost entirely concentrated in the former soviet union with russia and ukraine accounting for nearly 95 per cent of output despite a drop of 16 per cent from 1990 the former soviet republics still produced 199m tonnes of iron ore in 1991 more than 20 per cent of the world total after the former soviet union china brazil and australia are the leading iron ore producers while brazil and australia are by far the biggest exporters
