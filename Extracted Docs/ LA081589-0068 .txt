Most of the largest U.S. airlines slashed their round-trip discount fares by as much as $ 160 on Monday to build traffic during the historically weak fall season . The round of fare cutting was led by Trans World Airlines , which cut its fares to 85 U.S. cities and 15 overseas destinations Sunday . On Monday , Northwest Airlines , Continental Airlines , United Airlines , American Airlines and USAir said they would match TWA 's domestic reductions . Delta Air Lines said Monday that it was studying the situation . Northwest , Continental and USAir said they would drop their prices only on routes where they compete with TWA . But American and United , the nation 's two largest air carriers , said they would reduce round-trip fares to all U.S. destinations except those in Alaska and Hawaii . One Change Allowed The airlines that announced the fare cuts are imposing identical restrictions : The reduced fares apply to travel between Sept. 9 and Dec. 15 , except over the Thanksgiving holiday . Tickets must be purchased by Sept. 1 , are non-refundable and require a Saturday night stay . However , in a change from previous discount fare offers , travelers are allowed to change their travel dates once without penalty . The reduced round-trip fare on Continental Airlines , for example , from New York to Los Angeles is $ 198 on Tuesday and Wednesday and $ 298 Thursday through Monday . That is a reduction from $ 356 round trip on Tuesday and Wednesday and $ 398 round trip Thursday through Monday . A round of fare cuts aimed at leisure travelers had been expected . `` This is not unusual to see , '' said Robert Gibbons , a spokesman for Northwest Airlines . `` With summer over and the kids back in school , vacation travel falls off some .
