Former White House political adviser Lyn Nofziger said Friday his successors serving President Bush have created a `` public relations disaster '' on the budget debate over the tax issue . `` I think that what we 're seeing is a need for consistency , and that 's what we have n't seen here in the last week and it 's too bad because the President is really better than that , '' said Nofziger . Nofziger , who was a member of President Reagan 's inner circle , was interviewed on the `` Fox Morning News '' about the White House 's apparent changes of position during the budget debate .
