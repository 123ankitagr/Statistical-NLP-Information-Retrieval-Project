i found patrick goldstein's piece farrell is addicted to not covering up his covers june 10 extremely disturbing i cannot believe what is happening concerning censorship i was outraged when i went into a record shop a few years ago in search of poison's open up and say ahh and instead of finding the original album cover i found a more suitable version the album cover was altered because the original version was allegedly too satanic i sympathize with percy farrell of jane's addiction i do not think he should compromise by changing his original album cover in order to please the narrow-minded moral majority conservative legislators and others are trying to limit my choices as a consumer and are undermining the constitutional rights of many artists ariel carmona jr hollywood
