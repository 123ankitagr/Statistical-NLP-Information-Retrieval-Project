A wildfire on Friday burned 4,000 to 6,000 acres of the Osceola National Forest and sent smoke 45 miles away , over Jacksonville . `` It 's still burning uncontained , '' said Scott Enos , duty officer and supervisor of the state Division of Forestry in Lake City . `` We do n't expect any relief from the weather before Monday . '' Westerly winds carried the smoke and the National Weather Service warned of dense smoke in Jacksonville over the weekend unless the fire is brought under control . Enos said the smoke was not blowing over major highways . The U.S. Forest Service said 100 firefighters were fighting the blaze in Pinhook Swamp , 23 miles northeast of Lake City . Enos said no structures have been damaged , and there have been no injuries . `` We 're working at keeping it within the forest boundaries , '' he said . Two helicopters and a U.S. Forest Service air-tanker plane using fire retardant chemicals dropped water on the fire Thursday , a state spokesman said . `` The air-tanker has not been very effective because the flames are so high and the fire is running so rapidly , '' said Cheryl Summers , information officer for the Florida Division of Forestry . Summers said the swamp area made it difficult to reach the fire , which was also fueled by dry conditions . Several commercial paper companies joined state and federal firefighters to battle the blaze . Lumber companies were helping fight the fire by cutting down trees . The cause of the fire , which began Thursday , was under investigation . It began on land adjacent to the forest owned by a subsidiary of Container Corp .
