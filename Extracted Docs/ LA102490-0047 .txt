Soon to Be Back in the Saddle : Roy Rogers , `` the king of the cowboys , '' is recovering from surgery to correct an aneurysm near his heart . The singing cowboy movie and television star , who will be 79 on Nov. 5 , had the operation Monday at a hospital in Apple Valley , and was doing fine after the surgery , his son Roy Jr. said . Rogers underwent triple-bypass surgery 13 years ago . Riding a golden palomino named Trigger and strumming on a guitar , Rogers rode off into the sunsets of some 90 musical Westerns in a career that spanned more than 30 years . CLAUDIA PUIG
