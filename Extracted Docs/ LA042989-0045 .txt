in their first public appearance since the march 10 bombing of their van on a la jolla street navy capt will rogers iii and his wife sharon said friday that sharon rogers will not be returning to her fourthgrade teaching position at the la jolla country day school speaking at a news conference the rogerses sharply denounced the exclusive private academy for bowing to an apparent act of terrorism under the terms of a severance agreement with the school sharon rogers a 12year veteran teacher there will receive a lump sum payment of $ 135000 plus $ 5000 for her attorney and will not return to the campus where school officials believe her presence would pose a risk to the safety of students and faculty the fbi has been investigating the van bombing as a possible reprisal for capt rogers order to shoot down an iranian passenger jet that neared his ship the guided missile cruiser vincennes in the persian gulf last summer all 290 people aboard the plane were killed over the past weeks i have felt many different emotions but today i am simply just disappointed said sharon rogers fighting back tears more disappointed than i can possibly express i will miss my relationship with the school but most of all i will miss my students and their courageous and thoughtful parents both capt rogers and his wife said they believe the van bombing was an act of terrorism mrs rogers added that the school by barring her from campus was sending out a message that it was bowing to terrorism i feel very sad for our country she said bernie fipp president of the schools board of trustees said in a letter friday to the schools parents and staff that safety was the prime motivator in the schools decision that sharon rogers should not return to teach her fourthgraders the school believed and continues to believe that sharons presence on campus would pose an unreasonable risk to the children at the school fipp said the school believes that the presence of the 24hour federal protection now being offered to sharon is evidence of the risks involved the school with 700 students and 67 teachers has been the subject of intense criticism both in san diego and across the country including a pointed comment from the white house in the weeks following the attack one of the toughest questions facing the school administration was why it moved so quickly to remove rogers from the faculty without waiting to see whether the fbi determines that the bombing was indeed a terrorist act other than confirming that the explosive device was a pipe bomb fbi agents have declined to reveal the status of their continuing probe sharon rogers was not injured in the van blast feeling a jolt and thinking that her van had been rearended she had jumped from the vehicle moments before it was engulfed in flames but she described that incident as a lifealtering event highlighted by the ensuing battle over whether she would be allowed to return to her job the rogerses were escorted to the press conference at a mission valley hotel by a large contingent of security officials from the naval investigative service when they sat down before the microphones the security detail posted itself at both entrances to the room and in the parking lot sharon rogers maintained that the school would be secure with her there because of the added navy protection i think they would be very safe with the nis agents there she said timothy m burns the schools headmaster who came under sharp criticism from some parents and teachers over his handling of the rogers affair could not be reached for comment friday richard roth a pasadena public relations specialist hired by the school said the 18member boards vote friday morning was not unanimous but overwhelmingly in favor of approval of the decision to sever ties with rogers asked why the board agreed to pay her $ 135000 when her currentyear contract is for $ 32400 roth said we want to avoid a legal action instead of paying legal fees from a lawsuit we believe it is more appropriate to provide sharon with this compensation capt rogers said he was disappointed in the way the school treated his wife but said he was proud of the way she held up after suffering the horror of having a terrorist light a fireball under her van i think that someone in the dead of night put a bomb on the undercarriage of my van and whoever that person was is a terrorist sharon rogers said her husband added i think they will run aground and they will be brought to justice whether its a statesponsored act or an individual act or a disgruntled sailor whatever it will be it will all come to light he also said he sympathized with the intense media and community scrutiny his wife had faced i had the misfortune of being at the center of my 15 minutes of fame earlier he said referring to his decision to shoot down the iranian plane while mrs rogers said that recent events have dramatically changed her life she said she plans to immediately begin seeking work at another school in the san diego area im going to start pounding the pavement next week she said im going to update my resume and hit the bricks on monday
