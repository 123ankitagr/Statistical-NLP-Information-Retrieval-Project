the annual rate of growth in m4 the broadest measure of money supply fell towards the lower end of the governments target range in october official figures showed yesterday the bank of england said m4 comprising bank deposits bank lending and all other forms of money grew 38 per cent in the year to october this was the lowest rate for almost a year and towards the bottom of the governments target inflation for m4 of between 3 per cent and 9 per cent measured on a seasonally adjusted basis the annual growth rate was 39 per cent the size of the drop yesterday surprised the city which had previously predicted an unadjusted annual growth rate of 45 per cent in september the unadjusted annual growth rate was 48 per cent the key reason for the drop was subdued growth in the level of bank lending total sterling lending by the main british banks to the uk private sector rose pounds 610m in october although this was higher than the very low increase in september it was below the previous sixmonthly average of pounds 712m borrowing by companies fell in the month as the corporate sector continued to repay bank debts accrued before and during the recession manufacturers repaid pounds 233m in october and financial companies pounds 341m lending to the personal sector grew by pounds 759m in october a slightly higher level than in the previous month but although consumer credit rose quite strongly mortgage lending rose at a slower rate than in recent months the treasury said that another reason for the drop in m4s annual growth rate was that the third tranche of british telecom shares had depressed bank deposits meanwhile corporation tax payments had been higher this october compared with last october partly as a result of new initiatives to persuade companies to spread tax payments throughout the year the treasury said the drop in m4 suggested that companies had chosen to pay this corporation tax through their deposits rather than by taking on new borrowing
