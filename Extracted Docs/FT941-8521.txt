when professor li yin ing one of chinas most influential economists advised people this week to buy gold h e was doing no more than preaching to the converted the world gold council estimates that since china lifted a ban on the sale of gold jewellery in 1984 increases in gold consumption have averaged 20 per cent a year given traditional chinese affection for gold as decoration and as a hedge against bad times this revived appetite for the precious metal is hardly surprising although the strength of demand has caught the industry offguard gold is so embedded in chinese consciousness that it ranks first in popular mythology among five sacred elements fundamental to peoples existence together with wind fire water and earth indeed the chinese ideograms for metal and gold are identical mr liu shanen director of research at chinas gold bureau in beijing says simply that gold is money to many chinese gold never loses its value unlike paper money its also money one can save and pass on to ones descendants a gold acquisition study conducted last year by the wgc in chinas three main cities found that on average one in five people in shanghai and guangzhou bought gold jewellery in 1993 followed by one in seven in beijing average per head gold consumption among 117bn chinese was dollars 42 in 1993 or approximately 02 grams per head overall gold ownership levels that is numbers of people buying gold were up about 5 per cent last year against 1992 but mainland chinese gold consumption per head still lags far behind hong kong and taiwan whose citizens purchase on average 10 grams each a year such is the obsession with gold these days that when young women get together they talk about little else but gold jewellery if youre a young woman without gold jewellery youll be looked down upon said one observer chinas gold bureau reports that gold consumption the bulk is used in jewellery manufacture grew from 150 tonnes in 1991 to 250 tonnes in 1992 compared with annual production from chinas own mines of about 100 tonnes gold purchases are expected to exceed 400 tonnes a year within the next few years this would make china the worlds biggest consumer ahead of india and the united states greater china china taiwan and hong kong is already the biggest consumer absorbing about about 500 tonnes of gold or a third of western mine production in 1992 prof lis advice to chinese to buy gold as a form of saving and more importantly his recommendation that a gold exchange be established is certain to attract attention in china where a vigorous debate is in progress about ways in which to rationalise and enliven the countrys gold market a professor of economics at prestigious beijing university and prolific writer in the local press prof li is also a member of the standing committee of the national peoples congress chinas parliament writing in the china gold daily he noted that allowing people to own gold in the form of coins or ingots gold purchases are restricted to jewellery would be a means of channelling savings away from shortterm consumer spending thus easing pressures on prices other benefits of the establishment of a gold exchange were that it would help enliven flagging production counter smuggling of gold abroad generate tax revenues and contribute generally to the creation of a gold industry in china debate about the establishment of a gold exchange has intensified recently since chinas state monopoly over gold began to crumble with mines selling produce on a booming black market energised by surging demand for gold jewellery state purchases of gold were down by 40 per cent in 1993 compared with 1992 in spite of a doubling from september 1 of the purchase price to yn2986 udollars 343 a troy ounce that price has not budged since and has remained at about 10 per cent below the world market with china in the grip of inflation the cost of living increased by nearly 24 per cent in december there would be lively demand among consumers for gold as a traditional hedge the peoples bank seems reluctant however to yield its gold trading monopoly in the meantime organisations like the wgc representing the worlds major mining companies are certain to redouble their efforts to promote golds allure in a potential market almost beyond imagination wgc plans to spend dollars 3m this year on promotion
