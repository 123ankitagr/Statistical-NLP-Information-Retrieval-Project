of all the villains of this world surely the worst the most heinous are those who wantonly assault anyone within their reach like gang hoodlums afternoon tv talkshow hosts and the movie talker is there anything more vexatious to the film fan than sitting down next to someone who starts squawking the moment the lights go down and doesnt stop until the iatse symbol rolls up at the end so i cheered when i read recently about the manager of an amc theater in washington who has decided to give these pinheads a oneway ticket back to the parking lot im not talking about the people who occasionally turn and whisper excuse me honey im going to the restroom or who quietly ask aunt bertha shall i get the regular or the trough o popcorn this diatribe applies to the hardcore abuser the guy who has watched so many ballgames on tv that he thinks every activity in life needs a playbyplay announcer oh man did you see what michael douglas just did to kathleen turner that was outrayjuss you know what id do if that were me id go into her closet you know and take out every dress and run em through the washer on the wrong cycle man yeah and then id i suspect that a thorough psychoanalysis of movie talkers personal histories might reveal that many of them as tykes happened to utter their first words in a movie theater whereupon mommy and daddy got so excited were so overwhelming with their positive reinforcement that they instantly ingrained a lifetime pavlovian urge to speak in a cinema more likely though the movie talker simply forgets that there is a difference between sitting at home in the barcalounger watching jeopardy in which case vocalizing is required what are ground sloths you idiot ground sloths and being in a public place surrounded by the public if im so sensitive why dont i just stay home and rent a video thousands perhaps millions do i have one friend who refuses to go to a movie theater any more because he gets too incensed by sitting next to some jabberwock but as purists know retreating to the couch is not an acceptable option nothing beats the experience of seeing a movie on a big screen in a firstclass theater anyway unlike the nononsense manager of the amc theater in washington whose actions made the national wire services the folks who run orange county movie theaters dont consider talkers a problem worth addressing an amc official told the times that there are no plans to institute similar policies here because audiences at the chains 24 theaters in orange county are 70 avids film biz talk for regular moviegoers and talking in local theaters is on the downturn well that certainly wasnt the case at the theater i attended last week true it wasnt an amc theater but i dont imagine it makes a big difference which chain you patronize or do the movie talkers stop and say gee i dont seem to have much to say today guess i better hop on over to the edwards as i sat waiting for the movie to begin some lunkhead started reading along with the opening titles assuming as do most of his species that everyone else in the theater dropped out of school after first grade the worst part isnt that talking during a movie is downright rude but that it interferes with my ability to appreciate the subtle craft that is the cinema at one point i actually got so distracted by this pea brains constant asides to his companion that i nearly missed the crucial plot twist where the giant sand worm ate the station wagon i hate that a few days later though i stumbled across another news item it seems that westminster wants to find a more profitable use for the pricey beach boulevard site where the venerable hiway 39 drivein stands and officials are talking about tearing it down i suggest that anyone caught talking in a walkin theater be ejected but instead of getting no refund as happens at that theater in washington the offender could be awarded a pass to the drivein there with his yugos windows rolled up he could chatter away ad infinitum without bothering a soul and by catering specifically to the movie talker the drivein will attract bigger crowds than ever placating the theater owner the city and the avids to boot i dont hold much hope that the city will adopt this farsighted plan but it might be worth talking aboutdr steve lopez
