the attorney for a man who was mistakenly jailed for three weeks in connection with a 1982 kiling said tuesday that his client described the ordeal as a nightmare miguel auclair valdez said his client miguel a rodriguez was shocked when it originally happened it was his worst nightmare he had never been to san diego he was just sitting in a car drinking a beer he was shocked and on top of that to learn that it was for a homicide was just terrifying rodriguez was arrested by los angeles police on march 5 and brought to san diego on an arrest warrant for another man with the same name who was sought in connection with the stabbing death of juan sandoval hernandez in 1982 photos compared deputy dist atty barry j carlton said it was determined that rodriguez was not the suspect after witnesses compared a passport photo of the suspect they had previously identified with the booking photo of rodriguez these people who knew the suspect pretty well still said yes this is him but this other picture is somebody else carlton said they looked enough alike to me that i couldnt say they were different people they didnt look like twins or anything but considering the lapse of time they could very well have been the same person but i didnt want to make an immediate judgment on my own when i got that information we had no interest in keeping an innocent guy in jail carlton said but valdez said that because of the time spent in jail rodriguez lost his job as a construction worker with a little more effort on the part of authorities they would have found out sooner that they had arrested the wrong man he said an exit visa from salvador was granted to rodriguez in july 1983 valdez said the murder of hernandez took place in august 1982
