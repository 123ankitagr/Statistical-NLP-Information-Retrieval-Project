Traffic fatalities in 1988 dropped to their lowest rate ever recorded in California , with 119 fewer deaths than in 1987 , the Highway Patrol said . The CHP said 5,381 people died last year on California roadways , a 2.2 % decrease from the 5,500 traffic deaths in 1987 . The death rate dropped to 2.3 traffic fatalities for every 100 million miles traveled by California motorists , compared to the 2.4 rate that has held steady since 1985 . CHP spokesman Sam Haynes said the 1988 rate is the lowest ever recorded by the agency , which was created in 1929 and has been monitoring traffic deaths at least since the 1940s . `` We believe the major factor is an increased use of seat belts , '' Haynes said . `` The seat belt use rate is up to 65 % on freeways and 50 % on surface streets .
