If the shoe fits , wear it , would be a suitable epitaph for Bancroft Clark , the man behind the expansion since the Second World War of shoe manufacturer , C & J Clark . Chairman from 1942-1967 , Bancroft Clark died at the age of 91 and was buried yesterday in Street , Somerset , where his great-grandfather first started making sheepskin slippers . It was Bancroft who had the foresight to develop the piece of foot folklore familiar to millions - the Clarks foot-gauge - just in time for the baby boom . 'On this idea the vast expansion in our children 's business was founded , ' he once proudly claimed . Associates attribute Clark 's firmer footing in the latter half of the century , when UK shoe manufacturers were assailed by cheaper imports , to Bancroft 's foresight . A stern disciplinarian , Bancroft is believed to have been intensely irritated by the row among Clark 's shareholders which threatened to throw the family-owned company into the arms of conglomerate Berisford International . However , age and illness prevented 'Mr Bancroft ' , as he was known to employees and village residents , from taking an active role in resolving the dispute .
