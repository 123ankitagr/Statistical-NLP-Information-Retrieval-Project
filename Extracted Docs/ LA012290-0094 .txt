The Hollywood Foreign Press Assn. , notes one television producer , was always considered five to 10 years behind the times . Note its selection of Pia Zadora as `` new star of the year '' in 1981 . But , if Saturday evening 's 47th annual Golden Globe Awards was any indication , the group has become almost cutting edge . Performances by Wayne Newton and Suzanne Somers notwithstanding , a tone of `` relevance '' and social activism dominated the night . Vietnam was very much in the forefront . Oliver Stone 's `` Born on the Fourth of July '' swept four of the five categories in which it was nominated including motion picture ( drama ) , director , screenplay and actor ( Tom Cruise ) -- boding well for similar victories in March 's Academy Awards ceremonies . ( Eight of the last Golden Globe best picture winners have gone on to repeat during the Oscars . ) Though its star Dana Delaney was edged out by Angela Lansbury ( `` Murder , She Wrote '' ) in the TV acting category , `` China Beach '' -- which focuses on the women in the Vietnamese conflict -- was named best dramatic TV series . Civil rights was also in the spotlight . `` Driving Miss Daisy , '' the story of an elderly Jewish woman and her black chauffeur , walked off with the best motion picture ( musical or comedy ) award and the film 's co-stars , Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman , won the top honors in their respective categories . Denzel Washington , who played a member of the first black infantry regiment in the Civil War epic `` Glory , '' was selected as the best supporting actor in a dramatic motion picture . Ted Danson , designated best actor in a TV series ( musical or comedy ) for his performance in `` Cheers , '' called for people to get off their couches and `` hit the streets . . . to get out there and do something , '' while perennial favorite Audrey Hepburn , recipient of the evening 's Cecil B. DeMille Award and a UNICEF activist , hailed the media ( `` radio , newspapers , films , TV -- all of it '' ) for helping to create a `` global compassion which to so many has become the lifeline and , in fact , saved millions of lives . '' The evening , broadcast by the Turner Broadcasting System , was as presenter James Woods described it , one of those `` nice , silly perks '' of the business . A rare opportunity for TV and film folk to co-mingle at what felt more like a sprawling family cocktail party than a stiff , career-impacting awards ceremony . Celebrities ranging from Gregory Peck to Tom Selleck made appearances . The festivities were relaxed and upbeat . One of the evenings biggest laughs occurred when Diane English , producer of `` Murphy Brown '' -- winner of the award for best TV series ( musical or comedy ) -- dangled one of the dried-out squabs from the dinner salad and asked if anyone wanted hers . Another when Steve Martin and Billy Crystal -- losers to Morgan Freeman in the movie actor category -- startled hosts Sam Elliott and Cybill Shepard by running on stage demanding to know who came in second . Director Oliver Stone was asked backstage to compare this win with that of his first Vietnam film `` Platoon . '' `` Like getting a second daughter married off , '' he said with a weary smile . Cruise , noting that Ron Kovic , the disabled veteran on whom `` Born '' was based , had been wounded 22 years ago to the day , expressed hope that `` after tonight Jan. 20 will carry with it a better memory '' for him . Kovic sounded patently political with allusions to a `` new America '' and John F. Kennedy . He refused to confirm reports that he 's running for Congress in Orange County but declared in the euphoria of the moment : `` If I do decide to run , I will win . '' If outsiders were tempted to read into the fact that minority artists scored big , the actors themselves did not . Asked how she interpreted the fact that her co-star Freeman and Washington won major awards , Jessica Tandy said : `` They 're both damn good actors . . . that 's all . '' Washington , too , cautioned against excessive optimism . `` I never regard anything as monumental , '' he said . `` It 's all evolution . This business is predicated on fear and spending someone 's money . You ask them to give you $ 20 million in the hope you can bring them back $ 60 million . We 're moving in the right direction , but it 's still very tough . '' The list of winners : MOVIES Drama : `` Born on the Fourth of July . '' Musical or comedy : `` Driving Miss Daisy .
