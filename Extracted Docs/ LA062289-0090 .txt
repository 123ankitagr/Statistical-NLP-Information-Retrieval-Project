Councilwoman Jan Hall has endorsed Councilman Tom Clark in his bid for Mayor Ernie Kell 's position in next spring 's election . Hall , who represents the 3rd District , ran against Kell last year , taking about 40 % of the vote in a runoff that Kell won . Clark supported her in that contest . `` Tom Clark 's concern for our city is evidenced in his longtime dedication and participation as a member of the City Council , as mayor for seven years , in addition to his extensive community service with many local organizations . I enthusiastically endorse Tom as the next mayor of Long Beach . . . , '' Hall said in a statement last week . The mayor 's position , formerly a ceremonial one assumed by members of the council , last year became a full-time post filled in a citywide election .
