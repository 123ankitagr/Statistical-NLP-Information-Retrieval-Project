The mountain of curly black hair , the motorcycle-style leather jacket , the basic black outfit underneath . And oh yes , the signature house-key as earring were all out in full force this week as Janet Jackson wanna-bes swarmed to see her perform at the Forum . Hey , was that Janet Jackson standing in line for her own concert ? No , but you sure could have fooled most people . The look-alikes were all ages -- from 10 to thirtysomething . Vanessa Simmons , 10 , wore all black with an `` 1814 '' pin , the name of Jackson 's latest album , and a baseball cap with the words `` Rhythm Nation '' printed on it . That 's the name of Jackson 's tour . Lisa Hewett and Beatricz Giraldo wore Jackson 's big-hair style and key earrings . D'LaVance , Rea Black and Arnold Brown , other concert-goers this week , could pass for a Jackson family portrait . From the silver buckles on D'LaVance 's leather jacket to Black 's oversized key earring , their wardrobes were exact . `` Janet is my favorite singer and dancer , '' explained Betty Maine , 9 , who wore a Janet Jackson T-shirt to the show . `` I want to be just like her . '' Once the show began , there was no mistaking the real Janet Jackson . She was definitely the one on stage .
