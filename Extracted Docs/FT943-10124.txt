in this the hottest english summer for many a year the question of the white dinner jacket has reared its lapels once they were strictly for the tropics in winter no gentleman could be seen wearing one north of port said once through the canal however the lightweight barathea cloth meant the englishman abroad could keep up sartorial standards without fainting between the wars the white dinner jacket became rather fashionable back home trailing intimations of longdistance travel and danger on the northwest frontier but what i mused as we wandered the lawns of glyndebourne on sunday on a perfect english summer evening is its current status most of the male glyndebournegoers were in black dinner jackets and there were a few eccentric interpretations of contemporary operagoing gear most idiosyncratic was a black leather kilt accessorised with a spiky haircut and an earring but in the end convention ruled and black dinner jackets the experts tell me that the ultimate colour for a dinner jacket is not black but midnight blue outnumbered white by something like 100 to one sir hardy amies that legendary arbiter of masculine style is in no doubt that a white evening coat is effortlessly naff more contemporary style advisers such as john morgan associate editor of gq and ashley lloydjennings of hackett assure me that while white djs can be extremely horrendously naff they can also be appropriate in very hot weather john morgan thinks that nobody too young and too dashing can get away with wearing one it looks like too much of an overstatement as if youre trying too hard if you are sartorially speaking a shambles or happily rotund or what could be called an older whoops mature sort of chap then if the weather is really hot morgan thinks it can look thoroughly distinguished lloydjennings says the white dinner jacket should on no account have any facings and careful attention should be paid to the collarshape the shawlcollar may pass muster on humphrey bogart oh the dash of bogart as the worldweary rick blaine in casablanca and snazzy bandleaders but the rest of you should go for a doublebreasted blazer shape with a peak lapel lloydjennings adds that white djs should only be worn in very hot weather that after all is their point they also look extremely nice in linen he tells me the white dj should be worn with a white marcella dressshirt with a normal attached collar not winged a black bowtied handtied it goes without saying and studs in stone or motherofpearl not black the black trousers should have braiding those who are optimistic about the weather and have a full formal diary for august might like to know that hackett of 137 sloane street london sw1 sell plain white in reality of course they are cream doublebreasted jackets for pounds 249 and linen ones can be made to order for about pounds 375 but remember not if you are too dashing or too young perhaps though the more persistent problem is what do you wear over your dj when it rains
