the most criticised aspect of president kim youngsams administration has been its inconsistent policy on the north korean nuclear issue mr kim has shifted back and forth between accommodation and tough rhetoric during his 16 months in office this reflects deep divisions largely based on generational differences among the south korean public and his own cabinet on how to handle north korea but north koreas apparent final refusal to allow international inspections of its nuclear facilities has ended the months of wavering in seoul the government now appears united in supporting stiff sanctions against the north this does not mean however that public debate on the issue has abated there are predictions that south korea could soon witness some of its biggest demonstrations since 1987 when the military government was overthrown as students protest that the governments hardline policy could eventually lead to war the nuclear dispute has served as a catalyst on koreas future role in northeast asia and seouls relations with the us its closest ally whatever the outcome of the crisis south korea is likely to adopt a more independent and assertive foreign policy in the future that could weaken its ties with the us and might even lead to acquiring its own nuclear capability conservatives have criticised the government for allowing the us to dominate policy on north korea at the expense of south koreas national interests they were angered by washingtons willingness to establish direct contacts and possible diplomatic relations with north korea a development they feared would weaken south korea and strengthen the north as south korea tried to undermine support for the north by wooing its chinese and russian allies so north korea was believed to be doing the same by using the nuclear inspection issue to gain us diplomatic recognition the collapse of washingtons conciliatory approach to north korea in response to pyongyangs continued refusal to make concessions on nuclear inspections has vindicated the conservative faction and strengthened its influence but there are doubts in the two opposition parties and among the 84 per cent of the population born after the korean war ended in 1953 that confrontation with north korea is desirable university students believe that the us and japan not north korea represent the biggest potential threats to south korea according to a recent survey they claim that the nuclear dispute has been provoked by the us to reverse washingtons dwindling influence on the korean peninsula antiamerican feeling is widespread because of past us support for the countrys military rulers this view is not limited to students the us military and cia are causing this crisis because they need a new enemy to replace the soviet union and thus maintain their huge budgets that enemy is north korea says a south korean businessman public distrust is even greater concerning japan koreas traditional foe one sign of widespread suspicion toward japan is the plot of south koreas current bestselling novel a thriller called the rose of sharon has blossomed the title referring to koreas national flower it is the late 1990s and japan has launched a limited military attack against south korea as a result of a dispute between the two countries over raw materials from russia south korea suddenly reveals that it has been secretly cooperating with north korea on a nuclear bomb the two koreas explode the device on a deserted island near tokyo as a warning and japan surrenders korea has obtained just revenge for japans harsh colonial rule of the korean peninsula in the early 20th century the popularity of the novel suggests that one unexpected result of the north korean nuclear dispute may be growing public acceptance for south korea to possess its own nuclear arsenal many people wonder if south korea should try to inherit the north korean bomb once reunification occurs or try to develop our own since it would improve our security and status said one korean journalist we would no longer be the korean shrimp among the whales of japan china and russia south korea tried to develop a nuclear bomb in the 1970s under its former military president mr park chung hee to counter the norths military strength it was forced to abandon the programme under us pressure in contrast it is the left that is now leading the call for south korea to acquire nuclear capability to counter what is perceived to be a potential japanese atomic threat there is concern in south korea about japans growing stockpile of plutonium the key ingredient in manufacturing a nuclear weapon japan is also building a plutonium processing plant and recently began operating an experimental fast breeder reactor that can produce additional plutonium north korea has tried to exploit the souths fears by suggesting that its suspected nuclear programme is meant to contain japan which it accuses of racing headlong toward nuclear armament moderate south korean politicians are also beginning to argue that their country should acquire the potential capability to enter the nuclear club in response to possible atomic threats from either north korea or japan mr park chanjong an opposition mp who is one of south koreas most popular politicians recently proposed that the country should acquire enrichment and reprocessing facilities that could extract plutonium from the nuclear waste generated by its 20 current and planned commercial reactors the reprocessing facilities would enable south korea to obtain plutonium for possible nuclear weapons in the event of an national emergency although mr park supports strict international inspection procedures for the south korean reprocessing facilities their existence would serve as a check against north korean tactics we can talk on equal terms with other nations which have similar nuclear facilities he said though japan is exemplary in terms of its nuclear transparency no one can deny its potential for nuclear weapons capability south korean nuclear industry officials favour reprocessing facilities on practical grounds since the country is having difficulty finding sites to store nuclear waste but one obstacle is that the us has barred south korea from reprocessing spent nuclear fuel since the 1970s as part of its policy of stopping seoul from developing nuclear weapons south korean nuclear and missile sovereignty should be restored says mr park our sovereign rights over the peaceful use of nuclear energy and missile development have been unjustifiably suppressed by the us consequently this nation now has no alternative but to depend on the us for its security whenever threatened by the north korean strategic capability the government has strongly condemned any suggestion that it is considering building nuclear reprocessing facilities explaining it would increase tensions in the region it would also violate the 1991 northsouth korean denuclearisation treaty which bans plutoniumseparation facilities the proposal to acquire reprocessing capabilities is an irresponsible idea being promoted by the opposition says one aide to president kim youngsam but that may not be true much longer if the government decides to nullify the interkorean denuclearisation treaty because of north koreas construction of a suspected nuclear reprocessing facility and its refusal to allow international nuclear inspections
