the uk is overwhelmingly a property-owning society with the private rental sector accounting for only 7.4 per cent of the total housing stock but for a variety of reasons many people are now becoming tenants some foresee a prolonged period of low inflation and high real interest rates so that owning property may not be the good deal it was for much of the 1980 s others have sold their homes and are renting on a short-term basis while looking for the right property to buy once you have settled the economic arguments the main drawback to renting is that you are living in someone else's property you are unlikely to be able to redecorate the place to your taste and if you have children or lots of parties you will be constantly worried about wear and tear to the property until the 1988 housing act it was arguably more desirable to be a tenant than a landlord but as the accompanying article explains the renting sector shifted in favour of landlords once the act had come into force on january 15, 1989, doing away with protected tenancies for new tenants a landlord instead of needing grounds for possession in order to evict a tenant can now evict them at two months notice once the first six-month period under the new assured shorthold tenancy is up finding a property to rent people usually find a flat or house through the classified columns estate agents or a letting agency the advantage of the last is convenience though the drawback is that you pay for the service if you find a property through an estate agent the person wishing to let it pays the collapse of a number of letting agencies in the past few years has highlighted the risk that tenants could lose their deposit there are no legal requirements comparable to those required of solicitors or financial advisers for the holding of deposits in separate client accounts john andrews was one of the lucky ones he used the letting agency busy bees to rent a flat in finsbury park london but was upset about the amount of money extracted from him they wanted one month's deposit a six-week arrangement fee for finding the place and one month's rent in advance i had to write out a cheque for near on pounds 1,000 busy bees went bust a year ago mr andrews had already moved on and recovered his deposit from the agency but others lost the money they had left with it ensure that the letting or estate agent is a member of the association of residential letting agents or the national association of estate agents the association gives guidelines to member firms including the stipulation that tenants deposits be put in a separate account you are entitled to have this deposit returned to you with interest do not pay a fee to a letting agency until it finds the place you are renting it is illegal for the agency to extract money from you before then the tenancy agreement if you rented on or after january 15, 1989, you will fall into one of three categories of tenant 1 assured shorthold tenant this is now the most common form of tenancy arrangement your tenancy is for a fixed six-month period during which you cannot be evicted at the end of the six months the landlord can evict you but has to give you two months notice 2 assured tenant this gives you greater protection you have a right to stay for a fixed period of time unless the landlord has grounds for possession there are about 20 grounds the rent can be assessed by the landlord once a year 3 non-assured tenant if you are neither of the above you are likely to be a non-assured tenant people who have a resident landlord may not realise that they fall into this category those who do not pay rent or have a company let are also non-assured tenants you have few rights as a non-assured tenant and could be given only four weeks notice to leave although your landlord would have to go to court to evict you according to shelter many people do not realise that a verbal agreement is just as legally binding as a written agreement in many cases it can be better said john goodwin of shelter because a written agreement tends to have a lot of exclusion clauses but take a friend who can act as a witness to back you up if necessary if you sign a written agreement with your landlord have it looked at by a solicitor the citizen's advice bureau or a housing law advice centre moving in you will be required to pay a deposit usually equivalent to a month's rent you should certainly not agree to more than two months rent unless your tenancy is more than 21 months shelter's advice is that when paying the deposit you get a written statement from the landlord stating clearly how much deposit has been paid and whether or not it is returnable also get the landlord to state what it could be used for such as breakages or unpaid rent if there is no inventory take one yourself and get the landlord to sign it if you are presented with an inventory carefully check all the items and if you notice defects on some items tell the landlord you do not want to be told that the bath has to be replaced because you chipped it when you had noticed that it was chipped when you moved in rents the new housing act means that landlords can charge the market rent rather than a fair rent as previously required they can also review the rent every year under the assured or assured shorthold tenancy you are not eligible to take an appeal for a fair rent to a rent office if you think you are being charged above market rent you should contact the rent assessment committee or your local citizen's advice bureau problems a common problem is a refusal by the landlord to pay for necessary maintenance of the property but since he is obliged to do structural repairs and to ensure that the amenities are working you can take him to court the small claims court will resolve disputes involving sums up to pounds 1,000 for a small fee another common problem is that the landlord withholds the deposit when you move out saying that it will be needed to clear up the mess you left behind a practical but not strictly legal way of anticipating this problem is to withhold your final month's rent to offset against the potential loss of the deposit if disputes arise contact national association of citizens advice bureaux 071 833 2181 shelter 071 253 0202 free booklet on private tenants rights federation of independent advice centres 071 274 1839
