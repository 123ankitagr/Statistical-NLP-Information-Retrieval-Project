Rancho Palos Verdes residents who want to have their Christmas trees recycled into mulch can bring the undecorated trees ( no tinsel and no flocked trees ) to City Hall from Dec. 28 through Jan. 6 . They should put the trees into a marked bin at the City Hall parking lot at 30940 Hawthorne Blvd . Most of the mulch will be used in public areas of the city . Residents who want some for their own yards should call the city Public Works Department at 541-6500 . Residents who choose not to recycle can leave their Christmas trees at curbside .
