it didn't take long for joni easterly of katella high school to come up with the reasons why the knights lost 59-43 to sacramento grant in the state division ii girls championship game saturday at the oakland coliseum arena we could have run our press break better said easterly we could have made some layups and blocked out a lot better on the boards and that was just for starters grant outplayed katella in virtually every category to win its second consecutive division ii title grant was making its fifth state championship game appearance in a row the pacers finished the season with a 32-3 record katella playing in its first state final ended its season 29-4 we can play better easterly a guard said that's what hurts we definitely could have given them a better game easterly certainly did her part scoring a game-high 22 points and grabbing a team-high seven rebounds she played so hard that several times late in the game she was doubled over gasping for breath during stops in play margaret harker a forward and angie gomez a guard added eight and seven points respectively but it wasn't enough to contend with a balanced relentless grant team tina green was one of four grant players who scored in double figures green a senior forward had 19 points and 11 rebounds shawyna robertson had 15, kimyatta horton 12 and tesia green 10 they were the quickest best-shooting team we've faced katella coach barb bausch said we can't hold our heads down we got beat by the best team i've seen this season we did everything we could do i thought after a slow start grant trailed 16-12 at the end of the first quarter the pacers jump-started their game tina green and robertson led grant's second-quarter spurt that effectively broke katella's momentum the pacers outscored the knights 14-7 to take a 26-23 lead after three straight baskets by robertson to open the third quarter grant led 32-23 and the game seemed to be firmly in the pacers control katella made a couple of charges to get close but grant pulled away each time the knights best streak got them within four late in the third quarter a three-pointer and a fast break layup by gomez cut grant's lead to 34-30 but tina green scored on a follow shot and hit a jumper to push the lead back to 38-30 grant then outscored katella 14-4 in the first four minutes of the fourth quarter easterly fouled out with three minutes left but it made little difference at that point we didn't board bausch said and what do you do when you can't score for five minutes straight the knights went scoreless for 5 51 in the second quarter you can't have those breakdowns everything seemed to go as planned for grant particularly after the first quarter rebounding and holding easterly to her average of 22 points per game were key factors said grant coach connie zuercher if we stopped her from scoring 30 points and outrebounded them i thought we would win said zuercher grant outrebounded katella by a 48-25 margin even more telling was the fact that the knights got just four offensive rebounds grant had 22 and that contributed greatly to its victory many of its points came on second and third-shot opportunities we had to screen off as best we could and we didn't do it from what i saw bausch said said zuercher we worked in practice on allowing them one shot and that's it zuercher coached her final game saturday she is retiring to spend more time with her newborn son max and pursue a master's degree
