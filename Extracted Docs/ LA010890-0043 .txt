The trial of a graduate student charged with crippling a national computer network , scheduled to open this week , was expected to call attention to security laws that protect electronic communications systems . Jury selection was to begin today in the case of Robert T. Morris Jr. , 24 , of Arnold , Md. , the first person to be tried criminally under the 1986 federal Computer Fraud and Abuse Act . Morris , suspended from graduate studies at Cornell University at Syracuse , N.
