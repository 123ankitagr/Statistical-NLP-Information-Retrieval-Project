Regarding the very long article on Dr. Grimes , what a sad commentary on our civilization that such a talented and accomplished doctor is using his medical knowledge to extinguish life rather than save it . It was especially disturbing to read that the doctor and his wife could n't stand to see his first hospitalized pediatric patient die , but that it does n't bother them to see a life snuffed out with the use of the RU-486 pill or other means .
