george raveling usc basketball coach kept staring at the scoreboard during monday night's game against stanford at the sports arena i thought the scoreboard was broken raveling said it seemed like we were stuck on 49 points forever the scoreboard was functioning properly but the same cannot be said of trojans who unraveled like a cheap suit in the final 10 minutes of a 68-52 loss to no 16-ranked stanford before 2,531 fans stanford blitzed usc 19-1 in the final 10 minutes to beat the trojans for the 10 th consecutive time in the second half we just did a horrible job of attacking the zone raveling said we didn't get any penetration and we weren't able to hit the outside shots and out of frustration some players started to go one-on-one forward ronnie coleman who scored 26 points including 17 in the first half said usc's offense was out of sync against stanford's 1-1-3 zone we just took a few shots too fast coleman said we were rushing our shots raveling also played role in usc's demise after trailing by as many as 13 points in the first half the trojans outscored the cardinal 12-3 at the start of the second half to take a 43-42 lead but raveling was called a technical foul with 13 59 remaining after complaining that stanford center eric reveno was playing too aggressively while checking coleman under the basket i had to get the official's attention because they were mugging coleman in there raveling said i didn't swear at the official i was just grabbing my clothes telling them that reveno was holding coleman's clothes stanford scored five straight points after raveling's outburst to take command of the game todd lichti made two foul shots after the technical to give stanford a 44-43 lead and scott meinert added a three-point shot raveling however didn't think the technical was a critical call i felt at that point in the game the technical didn't have that much effect raveling said there were 14 minutes to go indeed usc did rally to within a point after the technical before its offense conked out the trojans missed 11 consecutive shots before ken countryman hit a three-point shot with four seconds remaining usc is 8-18 overall and 1-13 in the pacific 10 conference and stanford is 21-5 overall and 12-3 in the pac-10 stanford coach mike montgomery was worried that the cardinal would overlook usc which lost 13 straight before beating arizona state last weekend but the cardinal had enough left to overtake the trojans we really dodged a bullet tonight montgomery said i was worried about this game and rightly so but we finally switched gears and got going again forward howard wright scored 20 points for stanford and lichti added 16 wright had eight points and one assist in the cardinal's surge and lichti added four points and three assists usc notes harold miner a 6-foot-5 guard from inglewood high who has already signed with usc watched the trojans play for the first time this season asked if he can help turn around usc miner smiled and said i think i can usc plays washington state thursday at 8 p m turi carter usc reserve forward sat out the game with a sprained toe
