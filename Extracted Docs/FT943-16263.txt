a new international agreement guaranteeing equitable access to plant genetic resources should be signed within a few months this follows the conclusion last friday of the second session of the intergovernmental committee of the convention on biological diversity in nairobi kenya where delegates agreed that there should be no intellectual property rights governing the use of the 500,000 crop samples held in the gene banks of 11 international agricultural research centres the committee gave strong support for finalising the agreement between the united nations food and agriculture organisation and the international research centres as soon as possible it will put the various collections under centralised intergovernmental control under the management of the fao's commission on plant genetic resources the agreement means that the collections will not be the centres assets but will be globally-owned resources and the centres will manage them as trustees not owners according to dr geoff hawtin director of the international plant genetic resources institute the centres will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring continued availability of materials under free access there will also be no intellectual property rights patents or plant breeder's rights on those materials in the collections which mainly come from developing countries and this condition will be passed on to recipients of the samples the institute has the lead role in dealing with plant genetic resources among the 17 centres funded by the consultative group on international agricultural research an informal group of donors each centre however is an independent legal entity governed by a board of trustees every year more than 120,000 germplasm accessions from the collections and 500,000 samples of improved materials are distributed by the centres mainly to developing countries the agreement has already been accepted by the fao's governing council the commission and the individual centres the opening of the nairobi meeting was overshadowed by accusations by some non-governmental organisations that the world bank was attempting to seize control of the consultative group's activities regarding plant genetic resources and to delay signing of any agreements until 1996 these fears were rejected by mr ismail serageldin chairman of the consultative group and a vice president of the world bank as based on fanciful guesswork not backed up by facts however mr henk hobbelink director of genetic resources action international grain says that in a letter sent before the meeting he told one of the non-governmental organisations that it would be foolhardy to lock into agreements before then in a statement issued to the meeting dr serageldin said the cgiar is committed to carrying out the responsibilities of trusteeship over the genetic resources in its gene banks in concert with fao and its commission on plant genetic resources and with the contracting parties to the convention on biological diversity mr hawtin welcomes the clear message from nairobi that says sign the consultative group would like to sign the agreement but since it is not a legal body it can only do so if each centre delegates its signature to the group chairman this is what is likely to happen believes mr hawtin but he sees possible delays if some centre boards still have to meet to give approval i'd rather see a quick signature than delays he says as would the non-governmental organisations which welcome the nairobi meeting's call for an agreement as soon as possible they see it as an important step in ensuring equitable access to the world's genetic resources
