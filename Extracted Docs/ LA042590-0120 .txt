The plans for growth at Spring Mountain Group in Newport Beach are coming fast . The holding company 's main subsidiary , Spring Mountain Escrow Corp. , announced that it expects to double its branches in the next three years by opening 40 offices in Northern California , starting with six new offices by July . The escrow firm has hired Ted D. Gregory as senior vice president and regional manager for the Northern California operation . He will oversee Spring Mountain 's daily operations and manage sales and new business development there . Gregory , who has 23 years of experience in the financial services field , recently managed Bank of America 's escrow division in Northern California . Spring Mountain was formed in late 1985 when investors acquired Shearson/American Express Escrow Co. in Newport Beach and its 20 offices . It doubled its size a year later with the purchase of Security Pacific Corp. 's escrow operation . It also opened several branches . Spring Mountain Group 's chairman and majority owner , Frank O'Bryan , has been aiming at Northern California for the last few years but has n't yet opened any branches north of Ventura County . By July , though , he expects to have offices in the Sacramento , San Francisco , San Jose , Concord , Manteca and Santa Rosa areas . About half the escrow firm 's business comes from home builders who steer home buyers to the firm . Those builders , O'Bryan said , are starting to build more frequently in Northern California and have asked him to set up a business there . Spring Mountain Escrow now operates 42 branches from Ventura County to the Mexican border . The escrow industry is highly fragmented , but Spring Mountain believes it is the nation 's largest independent escrow firm with $ 15 million in annual revenue last year .
