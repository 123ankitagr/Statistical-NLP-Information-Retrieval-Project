south korea yesterday accused north korea of violating the 1953 armistice agreement that ended the korean war by threatening to withdraw from the military armistice commission north korea said it would try to dismantle the commission unless the us agreed to conduct negotiations on a peace treaty to replace the truce pact pyongyang has violated the armistice agreement which provides that this document may be amended or supplemented only by agreement between the parties involved said the national unification board in seoul both the us and south korea have said they will not consider the peace treaty proposal until the north korean nuclear inspection issue is resolved north korea has refused to attend meetings of the armistice commission which helps supervise the 40year old truce since march 1991 when a south korean general was appointed chief delegate for the un forces pyongyang boycotted the meetings because it claimed south korea was not a signatory to the armistice agreement which was signed by north korea and china on one side and the usled un forces on the other south korean analysts believe north korea is trying to gain several advantages by raising the peace treaty proposal and linking it with the nuclear issue the most important goal is to exchange nuclear inspections for a peace treaty that would eventually lead to the withdrawal of us forces from south korea and weaken relations between seoul and washington the proposal is also part of the norths strategy to eliminate south korea from the current nuclear negotiations the north is seeking direct highlevel talks with the us on possible diplomatic recognition but washington has refused to hold discussions until pyongyang accepts full nuclear inspections of its seven declared nuclear sites another motive behind the norths action is to blur the international focus on the nuclear dispute its their way of moving the goalposts and obfuscating the issue said a us official
