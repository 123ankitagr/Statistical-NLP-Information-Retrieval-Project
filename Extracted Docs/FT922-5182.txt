only four months to go during the wigmore halls yearlong closure various of the other musical venues in london have been putting on recitals but none has been able to offer the combination of intimate acoustics and friendly atmosphere which makes that hall so precious from time to time the barbican endeavours to promote itself again as a recital hall and the past year has been a clear opportunity the sound is perhaps less poor for chambermusic than one might have feared as the acoustic gains in clarity as the number of players gets smaller but nothing can stop the hall looking and sounding empty when there is only a handful of people on stage for the celebrity recital by the takacs quartet barbican last wednesday no attempt was made to disguise the chilliness of the setting the players sat centrestage surrounded by a vast expanse of deserted platform the upper tiers of the auditorium looked to have been closed off at quiet moments the sound became unhelpfully distant and it was fortunate that so fine a group was playing as the audience was compelled to sit in silence this is a quartet with the ability to make its presence felt in any hall the players tone is well matched their style unexaggerated warmth and lyricism are their hallmarks although just occasionally there was a seasoning of their native hungarian paprika in bartoks first quartet and also the scherzo of haydns b flat quartet op 76 no 4 where the vigorous stamping rhythm was taken up rather noisily by the leaders left foot in their performance of schuberts death and the maiden quartet neurosis was held at bay where the lindsay quartet seizes the music by the throat or the amadeus was wiry and tensile the takacs still find time to shape broad lyrical phrases the elegiac opening of the slow movement was coloured with particular sensitivity the players will be hosting their own festival at the wigmore hall in 1994 so they clearly recognise where their true london home lies a word of recommendation too for the beethoven trio who gave the first of three recitals at the purcell room on friday each of these programmes features a new work by an austrian composer together with mozart and beethoven trios for which the players are winning an increasing reputation at home and abroad to judge from the standard of performance in this first recital there is no reason to question those high opinions the beethoven trio is a meeting of three equal musicians less dominated by the pianist than is often the case in more starry ensembles a trio of young and fresh interpreters able to build long paragraphs of music into statements of some depth and import the new work on this occasion was gerhard schedls second piano trio subtitled lamento which takes the music of the two armed men from mozarts die zauberflote and sets isolated phrases from it afloat in a sea of vaguely expressionist sounds not a piece of strong individual merit although at 10 minutes it did not outstay its welcome the third and final recital with a new work by thomas pernes follows on friday in a purcell room agreeably tarted up with paintings from the arts council collection including gillian eyress eyecatching spica and a yellow and blobred caulfield the english tenor adrian thompson and pianist iain burnside gave a recital on thursday fifth in a song series which would normally be staged one presumes in the wigmore hall certainly the wigmore acoustics would have been more accommodating to mr thompsons searingly powerful instrument he makes a clarion sound which is apt to go frantic with decibels in upper register climaxes and produce a cuttingly painful effect in the confinement of the purcell room which oddly seems to stop the voice dead without muting it passionate and in many ways persuasive mr thompsons recital problem was sheer vocal bulk from the start he was overwhelming his pianist as well as flattening his listeners in a schubert group though the passionate stormlashed der schiffer the boatman positively benefited from the ferocious despatch among a selection of hugo wolfs morike settings der tambour a drummer boys fantasy of food and storchenbotschaft storktidings with its bitonal piano part figuring the shepherds creaky hut and anticipating the methods of britten made a vivid impression an eine aolsharfe to an aeolian harp received a strong solemn delivery i found the five gerald finzi songs after the interval dullish and the four samuel barbers not much less so sure on this shining night sets words by james agee but isnt a patch on knoxville mr thompson came on in chefs togs for leonard bernsteins faure sendup la bonne cuisine the four songtexts being french recipes the 33year old russian conductor yakov kreizberg he emigrated to the usa in 1976 made his london debut on sunday night with the philharmonia orchestra at the royal festival hall in an allrussian programme it was not an exceptionally interesting programme but kreizberg made it uncommonly gripping and the orchestras playing was of the highest stylishness throughout the polonaise from tchaikovskys opera eugene onegin was a brief but cracking opener and its brilliant bluster was no sooner in our ears than forcibly contradicted by the bleak depression of shostakovichs second cello concerto op 126 a late work written for rostropovich in 1966 between the thirteenth and fourteenth symphonies our soloist was the american lynn harrell in the news because of his appointment as next principal of the royal academy of music and no more searching or finely shaped interpretation could have been asked for harrells tone is as clear as it is expressive as minutely governed as it is boldly and with seeming effortlessness projected shostakovichs invention is not perhaps of the most distinguished in this work which is just a very good performance on the shostakovich but harrell read in a marvellous intensity everywhere and the orchestra answered kreizbergs evident commitment with a hightension accompaniment notable for individual excellences the sturdy peculiar horn calls at the end of the first movement the splitsecond demented xylophone interjections of the scherzo as well as formidable group cohesiveness kreizberg cuts an impressive figure on the podium unflamboyant but intense dapper but keenly effectual his account of rakhmaninovs second symphony was beautiful profoundly persuasive the work can easily become a romantic thrash and in its slow movement quite overwhelming the string textures of the slow introduction were built up with glistening precision and brass layers superadded with a disciplined ear for balance the performance of the scherzo was masterly one blessed kreizberg for the tiny touches of violin portamento michael whights quiet poised clarinet solo in the spacious adagio took our breath away if not his and the movement went its noble way among the deepening shades
