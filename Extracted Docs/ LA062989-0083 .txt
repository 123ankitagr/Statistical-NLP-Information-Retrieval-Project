Part of the City Hall staff , long cramped in tight office space , will be moving . City officials are negotiating with a leasing agency to rent 6,400 square feet at an office building next to the new Guest Quarters Hotel , under construction on 4th Street behind City Hall . City Manager John Jalili said 33 staffers from the finance and risk management departments will move , freeing space inside the cramped , Art Deco City Hall . The move to Guest Quarters will be temporary , Jalili said . The city is planning to build a police station , which means the annex of City Hall now occupied by the police will eventually be vacated and made available to city employees .
