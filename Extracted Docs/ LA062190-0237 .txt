The director and co-writer of the movie `` The Naked Gun '' said Wednesday he welcomed Iranian criticism of his film , which shows the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini being slapped down by a Los Angeles detective . `` It feels nice to have enemies like that , '' said David Zucker , who co-wrote and directed the film with his brother Jerry . `` I 'm trying to do movies that make people angry . I must be doing something right . '' Iran on Tuesday formally protested to Turkey over the movie , which portrays the late leader as a terrorist ringleader with punkish orange hair under his turban . Two Iranian newspapers urged their government Wednesday to take diplomatic action against Turkey for the continued screening of the film in Ankara and Istanbul theaters .
