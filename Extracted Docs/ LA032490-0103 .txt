John Jardine , former Wisconsin football coach who had a heart transplant last year , died Friday morning of heart failure . A spokesman for University of Wisconsin Hospital said Jardine 's death was not due to rejection of a donated heart he received in transplant surgery on June 16 , 1989 at UW Hospital . Jardine , 54 , was admitted to the hospital Wednesday when he complained of shortness of breath . His condition worsened and he was unconscious and being maintained on life support systems in intensive care . An autopsy will be performed . Jardine was the Badgers ' coach in 1970-77 , posting a 37-47-3 record in eight seasons . His only winning season was in 1974 , when the Badgers went 7-4 , including a 21-20 upset of Nebraska in a nationally televised game . In 1977 , the team started 5-0 and won a spot in the top 20 rankings only to lose its last six games . Jardine resigned Nov. 7 , 1977 , after the fourth consecutive defeat .
