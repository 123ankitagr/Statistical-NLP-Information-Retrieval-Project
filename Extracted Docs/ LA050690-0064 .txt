marcus roberts deep in the shed rca novus this is an all blues album or so says pianist roberts it depends on how strictly one construes the term what his writing for a three or fourhorn band gains in diversity of moods modes and meters it loses now and then in true blues soul in fact he has gone so deep into the woodshed that experimentation sometimes takes precedence over celebration still its an intriguing example of his evolution as a composer wessell andersons alto sax brings to nebuchadnezzar the flavor of ellington or what duke might be writing had he survived and advanced e dankworth is a strong cut thanks to the inventive trumpeter for whom it was named albums are rated on a scale of one star poor to five stars a classic leonard feather
