The color of a home makes a first and lasting impression . For people who have been playing it safe the last few years by painting the exterior of the house white or beige , now may be the time to consider splashing on a little color . Color works its magic by altering proportions , calling attention to details , helping a house to blend with surroundings and masking flaws . Best of all , it can give the house a fresh new look without seriously denting the family budget . An average-size house costs about $ 2,000 to paint . Color considerations : Homeowners should start by thinking about what kinds of colors make them feel the most comfortable . Cool sea colors , warm earth tones and restrained neutrals are very different options . Each choice would result in a different image -- from a conservative facade to a bold expression . Family taste should be considered before making a decision . Then , consider how color can help achieve particular results : * Perk up a boxy house with colorful trim around windows and doors , along the eaves and on the porch . * Unify the look of a home with subtle paint colors in the same color family . * Emphasize architectural detailing with a contrasting color . * Tie together a sprawling house by using a strong trim color all round . * Turn a boxy house into an eye-catcher with distinct colors that accent peaks and details . * Paint bold and bright colors on a large house , and highlight its architectural features with white or a neutral . * Use a color surprise to wake up a traditional paint treatment , such as a bright red door on a white house . * Recapture the past with historic colors popular when the house was built . * Camouflage out-of-proportion or unsightly details by painting them the same color as the house . * Tie the home 's elements together by taking into account roof and brick colors that ca n't be changed .
