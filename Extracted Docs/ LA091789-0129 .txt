if you were looking for more great dance music from jackson a control ii perhaps you may be disappointed by this transition album while clinging to her dancemusic roots jackson has decided to branch out in other directions with 1986s control a commercial blockbuster she established herself as queen of the young dancemusic divas paving the way for the likes of pebbles paula abdul and samantha fox but she is now stepping beyond that bunch her goal apparently is to be another madonna the kind of dancemusic queen who can also sing ballads and pop tunes the album which she largely cowrote runs the gamut from social commentary to lusty sensual tunes from dance music to songs laced with jazz and brazilian textures vocally jackson exposes herself more not hiding behind technological wizardry as much as she did on control her voice however remains somewhat thin and wispy for what shes trying to do she needs more vocal power whats lost for the dance fans is crispness and punch the dance tracks on the new album are generally busier and more subdued than they should be what she hopes to gain is artistic credibility working again with producingcomposing team of jimmy jam and terry lewis jackson has made an intriguing album its certainly more complex challenging and thoughtful than control the move to social commentary however is a rocky one state of the world and livin in a world they didnt make arent interesting enough musically to carry the messages though the dance rhythms better support the lyrics on the title song and the knowledge the highlights are the bouncy escapade and someday is tonight a long steamy tale of romantic surrender backed by a memorable muted herb alpert trumpet solo that recalls miles davis sultry 50s sound more than any other number on this ambitious if uneven album someday is tonight is a signal that the woman who once seemed doomed to always be known as michaels little sister has grown up dennis hunt
