If you were looking for more great dance music from Jackson -- a `` Control II '' perhaps -- you may be disappointed by this transition album . While clinging to her dance-music roots , Jackson has decided to branch out in other directions . With 1986 's `` Control , '' a commercial blockbuster , she established herself as queen of the young dance-music divas , paving the way for the likes of Pebbles , Paula Abdul and Samantha Fox . But she is now stepping beyond that bunch . Her goal apparently is to be another Madonna -- the kind of dance-music queen who can also sing ballads and pop tunes . The album , which she largely co-wrote , runs the gamut -- from social commentary to lusty , sensual tunes , from dance music to songs laced with jazz and Brazilian textures . Vocally , Jackson exposes herself more -- not hiding behind technological wizardry as much as she did on `` Control . '' Her voice , however , remains somewhat thin and wispy . For what she 's trying to do , she needs more vocal power . What 's lost , for the dance fans , is crispness and punch . The dance tracks on the new album are generally busier and more subdued than they should be . What she hopes to gain is artistic credibility . Working again with producing/composing team of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , Jackson has made an intriguing album . It 's certainly more complex , challenging and thoughtful than `` Control . '' The move to social commentary , however , is a rocky one . `` State of the World '' and `` Livin ' in a World ( They Did n't Make ) '' are n't interesting enough musically to carry the messages , though the dance rhythms better support the lyrics on the title song and `` The Knowledge . '' The highlights are the bouncy `` Escapade '' and `` Someday Is Tonight , '' a long , steamy tale of romantic surrender , backed by a memorable , muted Herb Alpert trumpet solo that recalls Miles Davis ' sultry '50s sound . More than any other number on this ambitious , if uneven album , `` Someday Is Tonight '' is a signal that the woman who once seemed doomed to always be known as Michael 's little sister has grown up .
