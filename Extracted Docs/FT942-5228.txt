there is an office in crawley sussex that deals in dream tickets every day it books 2,000 of them free to destinations all over the world the air miles company last year had a turnover estimated at pounds 60 m yet last month mr keith mills and mr liam cowdrey the creators of air miles sold their 49 per cent stake in air miles travel promotions to british airways which now owns the whole scheme the administration of the scheme is complex companies pay the air miles company for vouchers it pays british airways for flights british airways earns revenue on its unfilled seats companies offering air miles increase their market share and customers who save up points through the vouchers get free flights the appeal for ba may lie in the fact that only 8 per cent of the british population has begun to collect air miles the rise has been rapid for a product dreamt up seven years ago on a train from london to liverpool but the potential is huge in canada unlike in the uk an air miles scheme launched two years ago does not include a frequent-flyer scheme where regular travellers are awarded bonus flights but air miles are now being collected by 37 per cent of canadians ba aims to invest heavily in attracting loyalty among general consumers with air miles issued against an increasing range of products the scheme is exclusive to companies within a product area with for example only one petrol retailer or one credit card offering air miles but the variety of products in the scheme is still narrow air miles will not renew contracts with companies if it has received complaints about their quality of service there have been fears that growth in air miles would be constrained by the number of empty airline seats this is not the case says ba the 2.75 bn air miles held by customers in the uk would fill just 10 per cent of its empty seats it says meanwhile messrs mills and cowdrey have retained their intellectual copyright and control over the international operation in september they plan to launch air miles in another european country thought to be the netherlands the astonishing thing about air miles is that no one has copied it says mr mills it has so much more going for it than a standard frequent-flyer scheme which incurs all of the cost but gets none of the revenue for the airline the use of air miles as an incentive for employees is an incidental sideline says mr mills air miles issued by employers count as a taxable perk whereas there are no plans to tax ordinary air miles which are classed with other consumer incentives such as 10 p off or a free glass in the meantime he says he still gets a tingle when he sees people at aiport check-in counters with air miles baggage tags first-time users never cease to be astonished and delighted that it works there are no catches it is easy they get real tickets and they pay no money he says
