CIVIL rights activist the Rev Jesse Jackson yesterday urged President Bill Clinton to end the crisis over Aids-infected Haitians quarantined at a US Navy base , Reuter reports from Washington . Mr Jackson is on hunger strike in sympathy with 267 Haitians infected with the HIV virus that causes Aids who are quarantined at the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba . 'Mr Clinton 's policy on Haiti is a sound one - restore democracy , return ( exiled Haitian President Jean Bertrand ) Aristide , but delaying becomes denial , ' Mr Jackson said . Mr Jackson said he would continue his hunger strike for at least this week . 'It 's a kind of leprosy island , and there they are desperate , they 're in the dark and they 're dying , ' he said . Mr Clinton has said he wants to lift the immigration prohibitions preventing people with Aids from entering the US , but has taken no action .
