advice for avoiding cancer don't smoke hide from the sun eat fruit and vegetables join the upper classes employ a chauffeur and don't look out of the car window epidemiologists estimate 75-80 per cent of all cancers are preventable in the sense that they are triggered by features of the individual's lifestyle and environment the problem is identifying the avoidable risks a few are well known and easy to act on much the most obvious example is smoking most risks however are less well defined and harder to avoid for instance cancer as a whole is more common and more likely to be fatal among the lower social classes this is true even when the statistics are adjusted to take account of all known risk factors such as smoking diet and access to health care researchers are coming to the conclusion that there is something intrinsically unhealthy about being near the bottom of the social pecking order even if you follow the rules for healthy living sally macintyre director of the medical research council's medical sociology unit in glasgow says the mechanism of this effect is far from clear though it appears that repeated psycho-social stress somehow depresses the immune system hundreds of different risk factors have been suggested for cancer some of them an inextricable part of modern life for example australian research has shown a statistical correlation between driving and cancer the theory is that the brain responds to moving surroundings by priming the body chemically for movement that never takes place the resulting chemical imbalance may trigger cancers more concern has been expressed about man-made hormones particularly in the contraceptive pill clinical studies involving tens of thousands of women have shown no general increase in cancer among long-term pill users though some groups may be at slightly greater risk of developing breast or cervical cancer but epidemiologists say people should not be too concerned about minor or speculative causes of cancer when smoking and poor diet are so much more important one of the biggest myths in recent years is that there is a cancer epidemic caused by exposure to radiation pollution pesticides and food additives says sir richard doll of the imperial cancer research fund's cancer studies unit in oxford these factors have very little to do with the majority of cancers epidemiologists are confident tobacco is implicated in about 30 per cent of cancer deaths in europe and north america they are far less sure about food and drink a typical estimate is that diet is involved in 35 per cent of cancer deaths because there can be a delay of several decades between starting to smoke and the onset of disease the big rise in lung cancer did not begin until the 1940 s among men and the 1970 s among women see chart the male lung cancer rate is falling in countries such as the us and uk where large numbers of men gave up smoking in the 1960 s and 1970 s but it is rising throughout the developing world female lung cancer rates are increasing everywhere although lung cancer is the most obvious effect of smoking 12 other cancers are linked to the habit as well as cardiovascular and other diseases however if an individual smoker gives up before becoming ill he or she can avoid most of the risk of dying from tobacco ten years after stopping half of the smoker's additional cancer risk will have disappeared in contrast to smoking and lung cancer there is no cancer epidemic clearly linked to changing diet on the contrary the most striking trend is the long-term decline in stomach cancer in europe and north america a fall widely attributed to modern methods of food preservation and storage which prevent the formation of carcinogenic decay products although colo-rectal cancer rates have remained steady for several decades in the west those in japan have risen rapidly to european levels probably because the japanese diet has become westernised with more meat and fat eaten epidemiologists say there is overwhelming evidence that a diet rich in fruit and vegetables reduces the risk of cancer but they do not know how the protective effect works a favourite scientific theory is that anti-oxidant nutrients such as vitamins e and c and beta-carotene play a protective role by scavenging free radicals which can damage a cell's genetic material food supplements containing these nutrients have become very popular as a result although there is not yet conclusive clinical evidence to prove their effectiveness the next stage according to speakers at the uk biochemical society conference this week will be genetic engineering of crops to make more of these protective nutrients catherine rice-evans a biochemistry professor at guy's hospital london predicts the introduction of plants that have been manipulated to produce more effective anti-oxidants should be possible within five years in this series november 29 introduction the growing toll of cancer
