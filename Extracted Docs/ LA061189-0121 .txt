The latest casualty of the March 24 Exxon Valdez oil spill is the major salmon fishery in Kamishak Bay at the southern end of Cook Inlet . Although ocean-borne oil from the spill had bypassed the bay , oil that washed ashore on nearby beaches has been pushed off the sand by recent storms and into the bay 's fishing waters . The closure comes because of Alaska 's zero-tolerance policy , meaning that the state will not tolerate any oil in the fishery to risk contaminating the catch or tainting the image of pristine Alaska seafood . The 1,000-square-mile fishing district is `` a very significant fishery , '' biologist Tom Shroeder said , adding that canceling the bay 's fishing `` was always seen as a possibility through we expected it to be extremely remote .
