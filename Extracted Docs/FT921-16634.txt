China has signed a contract to sell a nuclear power plant to Pakistan , the official Xinhua News Agency said in a rare report about Beijing 's usually secretive nuclear technology transfers , Yvonne Preston reports from Beijing . At the signing ceremony in Beijing this week , Li Peng , China 's prime minister , said the 300MW nuclear plant was 'totally for peaceful purposes ' . According to Li both sides agree the project will be open to International Atomic Energy Agency inspection . He said the nuclear co-operation agreement would promote Pakistan 's economic growth and benefit its people . Beijing has come under fierce international criticism , especially from the US , for exporting nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons technology . The US has accused it of supplying Chinese M-9 and M-11 missiles to Pakistan and Syria , and helping Algeria develop a nuclear reactor which could be used for building nuclear weapons . China denies all these charges . During Li 's official visit to India last month the Indian government demanded that China cease exporting M-9 missiles to Pakistan . The missile has a range of 600km , twice that of the M-11 . China maintains its official line that it does not advocate , encourage or go in for nuclear proliferation , nor does it help other countries develop nuclear weapons . The standing committee of China 's parliament last week affirmed China's decision to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty .
