a rapid new technique showing genetic abnormalities known chromosome painting promises make diagnosis cancer certain genetic diseases faster cheaper the first chromosomal paint reach market result joint venture lawrence livermore national laboratory california imagenetics medical diagnostics company based illinois they developed fluorescent tags specifically label 23 pairs chromosomes present normal human cells each tag pool 10000 100000 fragments dna identify chromosome made another chromosome painting kit developed uk cambridge universitys department pathology commercialised collaboration cambio biological reagents supplier also based cambridge the products developed initially scientific research doctors hoping receive quick approval regulatory authorities us europe use routine clinical diagnosis the technology enables scientists quickly accurately spot defects within cells missing extra chromosomes genetic material exchanged incorrectly two chromosomes the ability identify genetic changes evolving cancer cells help doctors direct therapy specific targets analyse effectiveness treatment last october imagenetics began commercial production orange paints nine chromosomes each paint kit perform 20 tests sells dollars 400 pounds 200 sales took much quickly expected product sold research purposes according marketing company life technologies paint generated record telephone inquiries the initial success recently led imagenetics offer original nine chromosomal paints additional green colour allow two chromosomes identified simultaneously within cell a second set containing nine chromosomal paints become available later year doctors using paints appear doubt usefulness for example patients chronic myeloid leukaemia genetic material chromosomes 9 22 mixed together identified using paints if leukaemia progressing rapidly several additional copies chromosome 8 may present within cell painting proving important specific indicator chromosome 8 says robert jenkins codirector cytogenetics laboratory mayo clinic this enables us monitor progress leukaemia patients diagnose effectiveness treatment much cheaply accurately conventional methods it costs dollars 500dollars 600 normal bone marrow sample dollars 20 plus labour costs paint probe i would love paints fda food drug administration approved clinical use patients could use tomorrow says jenkins in addition leukaemia research scientists developing specific chromosome probes diagnose track aberrations associated congenital abnormalities joe gray dan pinkel first developed staining techniques livermore left last year head team university california medical centre san francisco working probes clinical application for example probe comprising part chromosome 21 determine whether foetus downs syndrome and making progress probes identify solid tumours including breast prostate cancers tom mozer project manager imagenetics hopeful secondgeneration forms chromosomal paints achieve widespread clinical use the company clients working closely fda get approval clinical use secondgeneration probes any application test case however fda never approved specific cell stain type approved one genetic test leukaemia a separate line research continuing livermore senior biomedical scientist james tucker using staining examine genetic consequences people exposed radiation he working chernobyl victims workers british nuclear fuels sellafield plant so far blood samples 14 sellafield workers painted course year quantify damage accumulated white blood cells longterm occupational exposure radiation british nuclear fuels says 170 sellafield workers tested time project finished 1994 results published
