the vienna philharmonic is giving three london concerts during the current season part of its european series shared with paris and berlin james levine conducted the first programme in november and riccardo muti will take charge of the last in may georg solti appeared with the orchestra on monday for a programme of mendelssohn the fourth symphony and shostakovich the fifth the combination of solti and an orchestra still able to trade on its illustrious pedigree ensured a full rapturous house it was though an occasion to inspire only modified rapture artists and repertory had been mismatched in a strangely perverse way applying soltis angular propulsiveness to a mendelssohn symphony is the musical equivalent of breaking a butterfly on a wheel while the vpos greatest admirers would not dare to claim that it plays shostakovich with the same distinctive flair and style it brings to the viennese classics or to strauss yet a genuinely great orchestra which the vienna patently still aspires to be really should have the potential to adapt its approach rather than construe everything within its own terms of reference it did so brilliantly at the proms last august when playing for boulez but seemed to be operating strictly on autopilot for the shostakovich here solti who appears to be working systematically through the canon was strangely restrained in the fifth too one expected this conductor and these strings to make something more of the opening paragraphs and to invest the heart of the slow movement with sensuous depth but no even the finale launched at a frantic pace ran out of steam well before the close it was pallid routine uninteresting only an encore of the fledermaus overture whipped and driven in the solti way with a sort of tightlipped humour showed any character by then it was too late royal festival hall final concert may 30
