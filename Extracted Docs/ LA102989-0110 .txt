El Segundo did what was necessary , stopping the drive twice within the one . That preserved the shutout and sustained El Segundo 's hopes for a league title .

And when El Segundo needed a score in a similar situation with 43 seconds remaining in the first quarter , the offense produced . Faced with a fourth-and-goal , sophomore running back Eran Taulua crashed in from three yards out for a 6-0 lead . That score stood until late in the third quarter , when senior quarterback Tom Cover hooked up with receiver T.D . Mayer for a 23-yard touchdown . In the fourth quarter , backup quarterback Brett Newell tossed a 25-yard TD pass to Eric Stevenson . El Segundo intercepted four Pater Noster passes and gave up just 135 yards in total offense .
