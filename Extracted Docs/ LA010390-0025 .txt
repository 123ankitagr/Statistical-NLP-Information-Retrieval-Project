i am sure that your article correctly reported the results of the hearing that banned offshore drilling in california waters so i am appalled that such a momentous step was taken using scare tactics that to any reasonable person should have dictated exactly the opposite result off-limits signs go up offshore part a dec 7 that a couple of politicians such as gray davis and leo mccarthy could use the exxon valdez as an excuse to ban oil drilling offshore means that they are deliberately distorting or ignoring facts that every schoolchild should recognize the exxon valdez oil spill which was used as the primary argument for the drilling ban was a tanker spill not an oil drilling accident the sheer size of this catastrophe was made possible by the concentration of oil production of many wells into one vessel in the hands of a negligent and very cavalier oil company it should be punished accordingly the truth of the matter is that we have only three places to get the oil we use so profligately in california domestic production declining and under great pressure from environmentalists offshore oil drilling in our own waters with a good environmental record and guess what giant tankers from alaska and foreign producers each carrying millions of gallons of oil recently i drove the oregon and northern california coast and admired its pristine beauty i'd like to protect it from tanker spills too i vote for offshore drilling with strict accountability for safety by the oil companies robert w deats pacific palisades
