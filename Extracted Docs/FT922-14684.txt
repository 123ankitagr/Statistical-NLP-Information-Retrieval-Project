EMERGENCY services were called out yesterday after a North Sea helicopter on its way to the Brae oilfield suffered engine trouble . The helicopter , carrying 17 oilmen and two crew , later landed safely on the Miller platform . The alert came nearly three weeks after 11 men died when a helicopter crashed into the sea while taking workers from Shell 's Cormorant Alpha platform to an accommodation vessel .
