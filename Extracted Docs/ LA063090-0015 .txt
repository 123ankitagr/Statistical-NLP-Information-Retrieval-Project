Why did Derrick Rostagno lose his third-round match at Wimbledon ? `` You ca n't hit what you ca n't see , '' Rostagno said . Rostagno , who eliminated John McEnroe in the first round , was overrun by Goran Ivanisevic , 18 , of Yugoslavia , 6-2 , 6-2 , 6-4 . Ivanisevic served 17 aces . `` I 've never played someone who 's played that well , '' Rostagno said . Rostagno , 24 , of Brentwood , was unable to break Ivanisevic 's serve , but thought he played well . `` I gave it all I had , so I ca n't get angry , '' said Rostagno , who has a sore throat . He said he is n't unnerved by losing , and plans to see the play , `` Phantom of the Opera '' before he leaves town . `` Things can go wrong , things can go right , '' Rostagno said . `` How serious can you take everything ? This is a game . It 's a great game , to be sure , but you ca n't forget what it is . '' THOMAS BONK
