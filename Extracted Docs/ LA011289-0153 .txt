another trend that puts irons back to work is dressed-up tables using a variety of interesting fabrics for tablecloths overlays and napkins a far cry from the clunky and heavy early electric inventions the new streamlined irons are lightweight a feature that can be attributed to improvements in plastic technology today there's an iron for every whim or need if you're forgetful there are irons equipped with electronic timers and microchip controllers that shut off automatically when not in use if you can't live without the spray bottle you definitely should look into an iron that features a spray button which releases thin jets of water to dampen those creases and don't worry about having to use distilled water another great development is that the new irons can take tap water and who's got the best steam competing in this hot arena are models with burst of steam features and larger reservoir capacity another welcomed factor is ease in ironing and cleaning to alleviate this common problem soleplates now come finished with specially treated easy-glide non-stick coatings and if looks are important to you some irons now come in fashion colors in bold or pastel shades if you're in the market for a new iron this year these newer irons were designed to make ironing a more pleasant and bearable task for you the most unique feature of the tefal steam iron is its extremely smooth soleplate in tests conducted by ironing across the zipper on a pair of jeans 12,000 times non-stop the soleplate on the tefal iron came out like new smooth and scratch-free this lightweight iron from france exclusively features super gliss soleplate a coating of pure durilium tefal's theory is that when the plate is scratched it picks up starch and dirt and becomes difficult to clean easy gliding is possible because friction between the fabric being ironed and the iron surface is also reduced by up to 20 sleek-looking in white with pastel trims the tefal irons are available in two types of model series the more deluxe pressing plus series from 75 to 80 and the lightweight pressing light series 60 the first type which comes in two models features the following an automatic

this powerful 1,200 watt iron is designed with a convenient tank-within-a tank system that maintains hydrostatic pressure necessary inside the water tank to produce a constant level of steam no matter how much water is in the reservoir the excellence iron seems to have a mind of its own as the density of fabrics increases the steam pressure increases forcing steam into the nap of even the most difficult fabrics and vice versa for light and delicate fabrics the water tank is transparent and detachable and when removed one can maneuver the iron under cuffs or inside pleats aside from having the power to deliver a super shot of steam on demand the rowenta iron has extra large-size soleplate for greater steam distribution the rowenta control electronic iron da-80 80 offers a full shiny metal base and is said to think on its feet even when it's not standing like the tefal iron it is equipped with a microchip that enables the iron to turn off automatically if it is left resting on its base for 30 seconds or if left upright unattended 8 minutes but going a step further the rowenta version even turns off automatically if it tips over or drops to the floor the shut-off is indicated by a built-in audible alarm that instantly beeps for two minutes another appliance manufacturer that has been taking irons seriously for years is proctor-silex made in the usa the newer offerings range
