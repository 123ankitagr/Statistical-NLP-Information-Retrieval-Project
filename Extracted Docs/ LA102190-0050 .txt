Regarding the article on the one-time beer ban at a Raiders game ( Part B , Oct . 12 ) : I found it interesting that officials at the Coliseum said they were not engaging the issue of alcoholism , but the fan violence . Do these people think that fan violence would be at this dangerous level if there was no alcohol being sold ? This is mass and classical denial of alcohol abuse . Alcohol is a drug that changes your behavior and not for the better . Let 's quit denying what the reality is and face this problem regardless of how much money is involved . LORRAINE MAZZA Orange
