it amazes me to learn that the reagans need more money in their retirement they have set astronomical fees for any and all speaking engagements in the future i wonder what happened to the allamerican idea of putting something back into the system when ones working days come to an end here in torrance through the retired senior volunteer program hundreds of retirees are handling community jobs with no thought of recompense and enjoying their ability to give back to the community something of value the reagans have more than adequate pensions to see them through their twilight years and friends made it possible for them to retire to a very fine home in belair with little cost to them what more do they need it is no wonder our young people have warped values when they see what our former leaders require for themselves irene adams torrance
