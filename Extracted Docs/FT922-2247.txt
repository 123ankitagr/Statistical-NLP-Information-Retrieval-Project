miss fischer is a hungarian pianist-musician of rare long-matured gifts and in her royal festival hall recital on tuesday there were rewards enough to satisfy all those in the audience who have loved and admired her work for decades now it was nevertheless the wrong venue and the wrong occasion she had been enlisted to take the place of alfred brendel laid low by tendinitis in the international piano series sponsored by technics hi-fi but miss fischer is no longer a hi-fi' pianist she is a distinguished elderly lady whose technical grip sometimes falters and whose fingers often slip though her musical instincts remain wonderfully vital a large part of the audience attracted to a recital-series like this one consists of younger hi-fi listeners accustomed to nothing less than near-perfect execution and much disconcerted by wrong notes she should not have been playing to them but to an audience of attentive aficionados in say the queen elizabeth hall or the wigmore that said i can report that in schumann and beethoven she was prodigal as ever with direct unadorned insights schumann's kinderszenen the scenes from childhood were utterly idiosyncratic neither child's-eye nor cut-glass but forthright and urgently felt sometimes bumpy too and miss fischer chose wilfully to repeat section after section ad libitum always of course with fresh lighting that composer's sonata in f-sharp minor emerged as a seamless lyrical whole with an impulse so steadily consistent that one barely noticed the breaks between movements in beethoven's sonata op 27 no 2, the initial moonlight adagio was strong sonorous emphatically pointed the scherzo oddly smooth and gracious its half-staccatos and rests melted away by perpetual pedalling in the finale miss fischer generated more exciting drama than i've heard from any pianist in some while his op 111 sonata rose above a lot of finger-slips toward a grand humane vision no motorised virtuosity here nor cosmetically ethereal effects but a transparent unblinking concern for the sense of the whole work it was a kind of lesson in advanced musical ethics just what we love miss fischer most for
