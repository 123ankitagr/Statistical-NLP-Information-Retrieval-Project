images linger from wednesday's grant-north hollywood high battle of the neighborhood rivals grant point guard jojo halberstadt leaping about at midcourt gleefully waving his arms after having fired a bullet-like pass to teammate rene de la hoya who scored the game's final and winning basket with five seconds left the grant student section simultaneously erupting in a frenzy north hollywood forward harry marks after a stellar performance burying his head in a towel and not surfacing for some time on last-second heroics grant prevailed 48-46 in this marquee game of the valley pac-8 conference season north hollywood 15-2 3-1 in conference play had suffered its lone loss to grant in a december tournament game in an understatement then the huskies had looked forward to the rematch grant coach howard levine though knew that his team could beat the huskies again if the lances just neutralized the huskies do-everything center dana jones the lancers 14-3 4-0 therefore stuck to a 2-3 zone that gave new meaning to the term clogging the paint any time north hollywood even considered passing the ball down low to jones five grant players principally led by center brunell mori collapsed into the key mori and the defense stifled jones to the extent that he attempted just four field goals he scored only six points that was the plan a smiling levine said after the game with jones ineffective the contest turned into a battle between the game's two most intense players grant guard keith weinstein and north hollywood's marks the two traded clutch baskets throughout the game with the score tied 37-37 and 6 03 remaining weinstein launched and was fouled on an nba-distance three-point shot that hit all net the free throw made it 41-37 marks who finished with a team-high 20 points retaliated with a three-point shot of his own and then after a steal of the inbounds pass hit a 10-foot jump shot to swing the lead back in north hollywood's favor 42-41 there was more with 28 seconds remaining and north hollywood leading 44-43 weinstein who finished with a game-high 25 points and five three-point baskets picked up a loose ball on defense and broke away for a layup again he was fouled and he converted the free throw to give grant a 46-44 lead marks however would not roll over fouled with 17 seconds left he nailed both free throws to tie the score 46-46 but that set the stage for halberstadt's 10 th and most vital assist de la hoya's layup finished the scoring and finished the huskies
