THE government 's campaign to improve public services has been seriously undermined by weaknesses in its systems for measuring value for money , according to Mr Howard Davies , director-general of the Confederation of British Industry . Mr Davies , a former head of the Audit Commission , the public spending watchdog , praises the government 's record on reforming schools and the National Health Service in a pamphlet issued yesterday by the Social Market Foundation , an independent think tank . He says , however , that the drive for better quality in public services is impeded by the Treasury 's twin roles of controlling spending and promoting value for money . Until June Mr Davies was controller of the commission , where he was at the forefront of the government 's drive for greater efficiency in local government and the National Health Service . Mr Davies recommends strengthening the Cabinet Office efficiency unit to promote value for money and extend the use of market mechanisms to improve quality of services . Fighting Leviathan .
