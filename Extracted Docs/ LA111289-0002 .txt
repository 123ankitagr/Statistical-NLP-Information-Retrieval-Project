there are two aspects of the margaret thatcher phenomenon neither of which is addressed in this splendid british biography that every thinking american needs to keep in mind when assessing the achievements of this remarkable woman first is her contribution to global diplomacy a quarter of a century after dean achesons remark that great britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role as trumans secretary of state he would have known thatcher has created a noble task for her country keeping american foreign policy on course when the bush administration was struggling to acquire its sea legs earlier this year it was thatcher who traveled to south africa to urge reform on p w botha and patience from the frontline states it was she who went to germany to try and win helmut kohls cooperation in the modernization of natos shortrange nuclear arsenal above all thatcher demonstrated that the psychological advantage in the armsreduction stakes was not the exclusive possession of mikhail gorbachev our need for her persists never was this more evident than during her recent trip to japan as the result of ronald reagans departure from the white house and mike mansfields from our embassy in tokyo america and japan have begun to drift toward the pacifics worse diplomatic crisis since the autumn of 1941 at this sensitive hour the worlds freetrading system and the western alliance have suffered for lack of an eloquent and forceful voice to speak in defense of that system and that alliance here as elsewhere the british leader has attempted to fill the breach the second feature of the thatcher revolution that americans should ponder is how she has exercised power contrary to jolly talk by american conservatives about electing thatcher president here her reign the word is not used lightly demonstrates the profound gap between american and british conceptions of the limits of state power to the notion of thatcher as an elected dictator i shall return this is a frankly revisionist view it sees thatcher as the new metternich the 19thcentury master of the diplomatic finesse as a powerdriven politician and as a militant puritan in this same revisionist mold hugo young the distinguished british journalist has performed a brilliant dissection of the notion of thatcher as a conservative icon in the iron lady young traces the winding staircase of fortune that transformed the younger daughter of a provincial english grocer into the greatest woman political leader since catherine the great it is without question the best of a bevy of new thatcher biographies that set out the often surprising always dramatic story of the british political revolution of the 1980s it also will leave the thinking conservative scratching his head to read young is to discover that certain suspect analogies have informed the american perception of thatcher as a conservative heroine neither the assumption that thatchers road to damascus parallels ronald reagans own timely evolution from new deal enthusiast to conservative idealogue nor the thesis that the iron lady took the tory party by storm in a political coup a la barry goldwater survives youngs analysis in ideological terms the author makes it clear that her paternal education in conservative sentiment aside not only did thatcher come to the true faith much later than reagan but that between 1959 when she first entered parliament and her crucial battle with edward heath for leadership of the tory party in 1974 thatcher had barely two conservative ideas to rub together no fully armed athena emerging from the head of f a hayek was she young makes a persuasive case for the view that thatchers lessthantrueblue ideology was mirrored in her policies as minister of education in the 197074 heath government she was not only a vigorous abolisher of private schools but also one of the great spenders of taxpayers money later as shadow environment secretary her ideas were distinctly interventionist even after thatcher became party leader in 1975 almost by accident realism and power politics not conservative ideals defined her program the tory campaign manifesto drawn up for the 1979 election that made thatcher prime minister in youngs words openly contemplated the perpetuation of the comfortable welfare state the only company nominated by thatchers team for denationalization was the national freight corp and this from the people who much later made privatization one of the household words of the age what transformed thatcher into a conservative revolutionary was the capture of power cunningly seized then almost lost in the runup to the 1982 falklands war it was only finally secured in the triumphant aftermath of her smashing 1983 victory at the polls in this twilight struggle for domination it was not only the partys influential wets who stood in thatchers way but also britains formidable higher bureaucracy young observes that there was a genuine clash of cultures between an almost cromwellian impatience with the status quo on the part of the thatcherites and the mandarin world of whitehall in which skepticism and rumination were more highly rated habits of mind than zeal or blind conviction the motif of cromwellian impatience bears brooding on cromwell was the 17thcentury puritan general who shattered royal power in britain by spilling the blood of charles i cromwell hammered home the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy he helped make britain a more perfect unitary state a nation with but a single supreme unit of government for american conservatives this is more than a lesson in foreign history it was against cromwells legacy of centralized power that our forefathers revolted in 1776 but this same cromwellian inheritance adapted to modern circumstance has been a crucial instrument in thatchers drive to force the british to be free thatchers achievement of almost dictatorial powers since 1983 forms the key chapter in the secret history of her reign the implied paradox has been nicely captured by a recent british assessment of the last six years titled the free economy and the strong state the politics of thatcherism by andrew gamble pace our conservativeminded pundits this is not the american way more to the point it may not be the british way much longer despite thatchers own ambition to go on and on young argues that in fact her era has come and gone the most revisionist thesis of all holds that thatchers place in the history books is gloriously secure but that it also is time for britain to look elsewhere for leadership
