Frederick V. Malek , who resigned as a top Bush campaign adviser and deputy Republican party chairman last fall over a controversy from his days as a Richard M. Nixon White House aide , is being recruited by the Administration to run next year 's economic summit with major Western allies , the White House said . Malek , 51 , has apologized for the 1971 incident , when he wrote a memo on how many top Bureau of Labor Statistics officials were Jewish . He has said he wrote the memo only after ignoring several earlier demands from then-President Nixon for the information . Recently the business executive has met privately with leaders of American Jewish organizations -- both to tell his side of the story and to convey his apologies . Jewish leaders said they and their organizations accepted Malek 's apology .
