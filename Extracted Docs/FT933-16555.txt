ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS Minister Mr Robert Tickner yesterday accused Hugh Morgan , managing director of Australia 's Western Mining Corporation Holdings , of waging a hate campaign over a court decision granting aborigines land title . Mr Morgan , head of one of Australia 's biggest mining groups , said a landmark 1992 High Court ruling on native land title , known as the Mabo ruling after one of the original plaintiffs , would create racial tension and economic stagnation . 'You 've got a representative of one of Australia 's mining giants waging this campaign of hate and bitterness against aboriginal people and it 's just got to stop , ' Mr Tickner said in a radio interview . 'It 's so far over the top , so divisive , and for any of us to give it any credibility . . . is , I think , profoundly un-Australian . '
