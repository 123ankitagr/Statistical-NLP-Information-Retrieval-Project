CANADIAN PACIFIC will report a profit for all 1991 , Mr William Stinson , its chairman , told the annual meeting in Toronto , but it will be well below the 1990 total of CDollars 355m ( USDollars 309m ) , or CDollars 1.11 a share , because of the long North American recession . He said forest products hold the key to CP 's immediate outlook . Its 80 per cent-owned Canadian Pacific Forest Products is one of North America's biggest pulp and paper products groups , but is unlikely to return to profits till 1992 . On Tuesday , the group reported a first-quarter loss of CDollars 5.3m , or 2 cents a share , its first quarterly loss since 1986 . Most analysts put total 1991 earnings at 65 to 70 cents a share . CP 's restructuring of the past five years is mostly completed and it is well placed for recovery when the economy improves .
