White House Chief of Staff John H. Sununu , reflecting President Bush 's anger , has warned aides against `` bad-mouthing '' former President Ronald Reagan , a spokesman acknowledged today . The controversy apparently was touched off by complaints from former President Richard M. Nixon . White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater , who also was spokesman under Reagan , was obviously angered in discussing the matter with reporters . Fitzwater , who at one point accused a journalist of fabricating quotations , said Sununu had noted a report that some staffers were making disparaging remarks about Reagan and had cautioned them , `` Do n't do it . '' One source was quoted as saying `` Reagan would still be asleep '' at 7 a.m. , when Bush typically arrives at the Oval Office . The spokesman disclosed the concern of Bush and Sununu in responding to an article by syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak , which said Nixon `` was so disturbed by what he read about Reagan-trashing inside the White House he fired off a protest '' to Sununu . Nixon was incensed , the columnists wrote , by a report from Knight-Ridder newspapers White House correspondent Owen Ullman that said Bush aides were depicting Reagan `` as a dunce and making unflattering comparisons . '' Fitzwater today would not confirm any protest by Nixon but said , `` The staff was told if ( Ullman 's ) story is correct it 's not helpful . '' He added that anyone who would ridicule Reagan should not be working in the White House under the man who was Reagan 's vice president . `` I do n't know anybody who has been bad-mouthing Reagan , '' Fitzwater argued , accusing Ullman of `` making up the quotes . It 's a silly story . I do n't know if it happened . '' Ullman , who was present at the briefing in the White House press room , shot back immediately that Fitzwater was challenging his `` integrity . '' The spokesman responded , `` In that case I apologize . I just disagree . '' Ullman later told fellow reporters that he did not want to comment further but said , `` Everyone here knows I do n't make up quotes . '' Nixon reportedly told Sununu that the source of Ullman 's report should be fired as an example to other staffers tempted `` to play the same game . '' Fitzwater called the reports `` irrelevant '' but emphasized , `` President Bush would not want any idea to prevail ( that ) this is going on . . . . We take it seriously in human terms . '' Fitzwater added : `` In my opinion , history will treat ( Reagan ) as one of the greatest Presidents ever . Everyone here certainly believes that . ''
