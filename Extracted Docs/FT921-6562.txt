J SAINSBURY , the grocery chain which ranks as the UK 's biggest retailer , has appointed the first female executive director in its 123-year history . She is Miss Rosemary Thorne ( above ) , currently the financial controller at Grand Metropolitan , who will join the Sainsbury 's board in three weeks' time . Miss Thorne , 40 , will replace Mr Derek Henson as finance director when he retires on his 60th birthday in June . Miss Thorne trained as a management accountant and has worked at several retailing companies , including Mothercare , Storehouse and Harrods . She joined Grand Metropolitan in 1990 . Mr David Clapham , managing director of Savacentre , Sainsbury 's hypermarket subsidiary , will also join the main board in September as one of three trading directors following the retirement of Mr Cecil Roberts . Miss Thorne becomes the second female finance director of a FT-SE 100 comp-any . Last June , BTR , the UK-based industrial holding company , appointed Ms Kathleen O'Donovan , a partner at the accountancy firm Ernst & Young . Yesterday , Miss Thorne shrugged off media interest in her appointment . 'The appointment of a new finance director to a Footsie company is always significant . The female bit only makes it marginally more so , ' she said . About 65 per cent of Sainsbury 's 100,000 employees in the UK are female . See Observer
