south korea yesterday indicated that it might accept loggers escaping from north korean-managed lumber camps in russia seoul has so far refused to grant asylum to at least 120 workers who have fled the logging camps because of fears that it could antagonise pyongyang and disrupt inter-korean negotiations on north korean nuclear inspections but the recent collapse of the nuclear talks has persuaded the government to review the issue based on the principle of humanitarianism said mr choo don-shik the presidential spokesman the government is also responding to growing public pressure to accept the loggers who are considered south korean citizens under its constitution the lumber camps which employ 15,000 north koreans were established in siberia in the late 1960 s with north korea providing labour in return for receiving wood supplies valued at dollars 100 m the camps are estimated to provide russia with dollars 300 m worth of lumber annually north koreans who have fled the lumber camps speak of food shortages beatings and death sentences for those trying to escape russia has pressed north korea to improve conditions at the camps and threatened not to renew the logging contract which expired at the end of 1993 the contract has been extended until june as moscow continues negotiations with pyongyang seoul will consider granting the loggers immediate asylum or ask russia to accept them as refugees with a promise that they would be eventually resettled in south korea but north korea has warned against any interference by russia or south korea and said it would hold seoul responsible for kidnapping loggers found missing from the camps but even if south korea accepts the loggers officials remain worried that it could trigger a bigger exodus from the camps and possibly encourage people living in north korea to flee across the border to russia and china president kim young-sam fears that allowing the loggers into south korea may eventually lead to the sudden collapse of north korea just as the exodus of east german tourists to hungary and austria in 1989 led to the collapse of the east german government said one presidential aide china has only limited influence in persuading north korea to accept nuclear inspections a senior chinese official said yesterday many people believe that china can instruct north korea to do this or that but that's not true said mr wu xueqian vice-chairman of the chinese political consultative conference
