Taiwanese travel agents lifted a 25-day boycott against China yesterday , despite lingering anger over the death of 24 Taiwanese tourists in eastern China two months ago , AP reports from Taipei . The boycott was part of Taiwan 's reaction to allegations that the tourists were robbed and murdered and that China covered up the facts . But the attempt to punish China appeared to have ended with travel agents and the government each saying the boycott was the other 's initiative . Travel agents say about 20,000 cancelled tours have cost them revenues of between TDollars 40m to TDollars 100m ( Pounds 1m to Pounds 2.5m ) . Last year about 1.5m Taiwanese travelled to China , pumping Dollars 3bn into the Chinese tourism industry . The Taipei Association of Travel Agents said the lifting of the boycott was approved by the Mainland Affairs Council , which makes Taiwan 's mainland policy in the absence of official China-Taiwan ties . Mr Micky Chen , the council 's director of economic affairs , said the government had never encouraged organised tours to China , believing it to be a dangerous place , but was in no position to impose travel bans . 'It was travel agents who started the boycott , ' he said in an interview . China and Taiwan do not recognise each other , and their trade and tourism links , while tacitly approved by both governments , are unofficial . The bodies of the tourists and eight Chinese crewmen were found in the burned-out hulk of a pleasure boat on Thousand Islands Lake in Zhejiang province . The victims ' relatives complained that they were denied information and harassed when they visited the lake .
