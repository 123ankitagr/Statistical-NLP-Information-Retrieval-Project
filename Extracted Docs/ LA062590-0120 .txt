neither rain nor sleet nor snow nor dark of night nor michael jackson shall keep the us postal service from its appointed rounds thats what lawyer thomas wampold reasoned after trying to serve a summons and other court papers on jackson wampold filed a classaction suit that alleges jackson was not sick as he said he was when he canceled three concerts in tacoma and that he therefore committed a breach of contract with 72000 fans a telephone call seeking comment from jacksons publicist lee solters in los angeles on sunday was not immediately returned the suit also names ticketmaster corp which withheld service fees from refunds on tickets sold to the canceled october and november 1988 concerts wampold had no luck trying to reach jacksons attorney in los angeles by telephone so he decided to have a process server go to jacksons residence but process server mark hamilton was turned away repeatedly by guards at jacksons encino and malibu homes at encino hamilton was first told that jackson didnt live there and then was told that he was out of town and wouldnt be back for several weeks wampold finally asked king county judge marsha pechman for an order allowing him to give jackson legal notice of the case by firstclass and certified mail the judge granted the request wampold figures guards may turn away process servers but nothing stops the us postal service
