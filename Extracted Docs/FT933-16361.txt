the language of the genes by steve jones harpercollins pounds 1699 251 pages if all the people in the world were boiled down into a soup steve jones tells us they would just about fill lake windermere the interesting thing is that the genetic diversity discernible in such a soup would be very small all humans are closely related because their evolution is such a recent event seen through the lens of genetic science humankinds nature and history appear fascinating extraordinary and sometimes terrifying the lens is focused for us by steve jones professor of genetics at university college london he demonstrated his remarkable gifts as a communicator in the reith lectures of 1991 from which this book stems in literate and highly readable style he explains genetics and uses it to take us on a tour of human existence one of joness aims is to rescue genetics from its doubtful past when nazis and others sought to pervert it into eugenics a second aim is to suggest what can and can not be expected from genetics especially in its medical applications but his chief aim is to demonstrate genetics in action as an instrument of selfknowledge revealing an extraordinary picture of what we are what we were and what we may become jones works at university colleges galton laboratory named after the eccentric polymath francis galton whose interests were amazingly diverse they included an attempt to measure the size of african womens buttocks from a distance by means of a sextant and the principles of surveying galton was the first theorist of human eugenics whose aim he announced was to check the birth rate of the unfit and to improve the race by furthering the productivity of the fit his ideas together with those of charles darwin had a powerful effect on the 19th and 20th centuries with appalling consequences as we too well know but the science of genetics jones says despite having the shadow of eugenics still lying across it has at last come of age genetics is the investigation of how individuals inherit physical and behavioural traits from their ancestors central to this enquiry is the concept of the gene the basic unit of heredity a gene is a packet of chemical information consisting of dna the collection of all such packets in an individual is called his genome the data it contains is equivalent in amount to a billionpage telephone directory geneticists are close to being able to read the entire genome and when they can they will not only know which ancestors gave us our coloration height and other characteristics but they will be able to tell us something of our fate also for example what diseases we are prone to suffer jones shows that genetics has already taught us much after explaining the nature and functioning of genes and how our genetic past lingers in our present he takes us through an unfolding series of topics a chapter on each they include human evolutionary history the development of language agriculture and urbanisation the effects of disease the question of race the promise and danger of genetic engineering and the genetic prospects for humanitys future each is utterly absorbing take the problem of disease the unremitting enemy as jones calls it it is one of the most potent agents for genetic change plagues come the black death aids and go when immunity develops but sometimes at a high cost as with sicklecell anaemia prevalent among africans whose red blood cells mutated to resist malaria some diseases had to wait until populations grew sufficiently large measles for example needs a base of half a million people to survive new strains of some diseases periodically migrate to humans from animals novel strains of asiatic flu start with ducks on chinese farms and reach people via pigs every few years one surprising lesson jones teaches is that the evolution of agriculture seems to have been at best a mixed blessing before it happened people had a much more diverse diet and lived in healthier places with agriculture came private property and taxes huntergatherers have it easier than farmers and urbanites bushmen spend only 15 hours a week getting sustenance for their families much less than half the time spent by agricultural and industrial workers gods remark to adam about eating his bread in the sweat of his brow seems prescient jones performs a useful service in demolishing myths about race humans share 98 per cent of their genes with their closest ape relatives but all humans are genetically closer to one another than are for example orangutans living on neighbouring islands human differences in eye shape hair type and skin pigment are strictly superficial i have always felt a certain compassion jones drily remarks for those whose ability to despise their fellow men is limited by the colour of their victims skin but it is humanitys newlyacquired control over its genetic destiny which makes us mistrust the future scientists dislike prognostication but jones bravely asks how will our genetic destiny be affected by our increased knowledge our younger reproductive ages our dramatically increased outbreeding or population mixing our ageing populations our pollution problems and much besides as you would expect his answers are both fascinating and startling
