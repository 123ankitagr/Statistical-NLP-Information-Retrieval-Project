computer leasing is not a business for the fainthearted a decade ago itel corp opm leasing services and other big lessors went broke these days the industry fiercely competitive as always is going through another shakeout but in that turbulence a northridge company el camino resources ltd sees opportunity el camino buys sells and leases computers to businesses and the company believes it can shed its smalltime status and become a major player in part by exploiting the problems besetting some of its leasing rivals were beefing up the leasing side because theres been a big fallout in leasing companies right now said david e harmon el caminos president and cofounder to be honest with you the company has always fed off of other peoples problems indeed privately held el camino was founded in 1979 just as itel and the other lessors ran out of cash and collapsed we were itels largest customer when they were going down harmon said we were buying products from them like crazy el camino has grown briskly since then as has the computer leasing and trading industry generally despite some of its members problems computer trading refers to the buying and selling of equipment between computer brokers and dealers such as el camino as opposed to the manufacturers sales directly to the machines end users in its fiscal year that ended april 30 el caminos revenue totaled $ 254 million up from $ 55 million four years earlier and the company now has 172 employees spread over nine offices total us trading and leasing of computer equipment climbed to $ 23 billion last year from $ 16 billion in 1987 according to the computer dealers lessors assn a washingtonbased trade group but el caminos size is still dwarfed by comdisco inc the nations biggest independent computer lessor which had $ 17 billion in fiscal 1989 revenue and by international business machines corp which in addition to being the worlds biggest computer maker is also a huge lessor with roughly $ 2 billion in annual worldwide leasing revenue nonetheless el camino expects to triple its annual leasing business which produced $ 82 million of revenue in the latest fiscal year because it has two new japanese partners with deep pockets japan leasing corp and applied technology corp last month they agreed to invest an undisclosed amount of cash in el camino in exchange for a combined 25 stake in the company harmon maintains a 27 interest and four other el camino executives own the remaining stock they saw it as an opportunity to build a substantial leasing operation here in the us working with us harmon said but with el caminos growth has come at least one problem the company is making less of a profit per dollar of revenue than it was four years ago in fiscal 1986 el camino earned $ 24 million giving it an aftertax profit margin of 44 in fiscal 1990 the companys revenue was nearly five times higher but its profit of $ 43 million was less than twice as big so its profit margin last year was only 17 by contrast comdisco a rosemont ill concern had a fiscal 1989 profit margin of 64 the problem brian ofria el caminos chief financial officer said margins are slim on many of the big computers that el camino buys and sells mainly because many competitors offer the same equipment like most of the leasing business el camino specializes in trading ibms products and ibms own sales and leasing efforts also have been a big factor in keeping a lid on the industrys profit margins ibm lately has been as aggressive as weve ever seen said ken bouldin president of the computer dealers lessors ibm itself is offering steep discounts on its equipment that people purchase he said ibm credit corp its financing and leasing unit also is offering aggressively low rates for lease deals as a result its difficult for some of the industrys companies to slug it out with ibm ofria said el camino also takes a conservative accounting approach to valuing its leasing business which hurts its profits specifically it conservatively guesses how much the computers will be worth for resale after leasing customers return the machines and it depreciates the computers value more rapidly on its books depreciation is subtracted from a companys net income correctly guessing a computers future selling price or residual value isnt easy the original value of a computer can plunge only a year or two after its introduction if its technology is made obsolete by a newer machine if so a lessor such as el camino could be saddled with an antiquated computer that fetches far less than originally predicted when released or sold in any case harmon said that with el camino increasing its leasing business the companys profit margin will get worse before it gets better but el caminos other cofounder david wolff an executive vice president said the increased leasing activity means more equipment to go ahead and sell and remarket when it comes off lease which should bolster el caminos performance in a few years harmon is key to el caminos performance at least to some of its customers hes very loyal to you which means that regardless of what the contract says dave will demonstrate flexibility said william strowbridge who runs the computer department at dataproducts corp a woodland hills maker of computer printers that leases largescale computers a graduate of michigan state university harmon 51 first worked for ibm for four years and then in the 1970s he was a vice president at electronic memories magnetics a maker of computer memory products wolff worked for harmon at emm before the two left in 1979 to form el camino was there a grandiose plan at that point no i dont think so harmon said because its privately held el camino has no quoted stock price to establish its market value but a rough measure can come from comparing it with publicly held comdisco whose market value as of friday was $ 775 million or 46 of its annual sales using that gauge el camino would be worth $ 116 million and harmons stake alone $ 31 million it should be noted that comdiscos price has fallen recently however its market value in march was $ 1 billion for now harmon claims he has no interest in cashing out by selling el camino even though hes already received at least one takeover bid and to hear harmon tell it few wouldbe buyers would be interested anyway because they would have to buy el camino without harmon at the helm i probably wouldnt stay frankly meaning a buyers prospects for making the maximum return are not as good he said and this is a people business el camino resources at a glance el camino resources ltd in northridge sells and leases computers and related equipment primarily to businesses founded in 1979 the company also provides emergency computerbackup services el camino has 172 employees and is privately held
