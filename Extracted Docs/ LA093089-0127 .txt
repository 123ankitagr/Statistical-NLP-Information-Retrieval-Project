in reaction to the kidnap and rape this week of a 12yearold girl in huntington beach the board of supervisors appeared ready friday to finance californias first genetictesting lab for the orange county sheriffs department authorities have said that such a crime lab might have prevented the attack on the girl because the suspect who has been arrested had been acquitted on a rape charge in april after prosecutors were unable to obtain geneticevidence test results in time for the trial currently california police agencies must send their genetic evidence to laboratories on the east coast and wait sometimes several months for the results friday supervisor don r roth called on the board to order a 30day study on how the county could pay for a socalled dna lab and how the cost might be shared with the state or other law enforcement agencies hours later supervisor harriett m wieder who lives in the sea cliff on the greens gated community where the kidnaping occurred last sunday asked the board to fully fund the lab immediately at a cost of $ 120000 both proposals are scheduled to be considered at the boards meeting next tuesday i dont want to spend any more time on additional studies or reports wieder wrote in a letter to the other supervisors by acting today the board can respond to this critical need in a responsible and timely manner that may prevent another innocent child from becoming a victim despite the different proposals one county official said it appears that the lab will be funded its just a question of how much and when the sheriffs departments request for a genetic testing lab has been rejected by the county for the past two years because of the governments tight fiscal condition in the meantime sheriffcoroner brad gates has organized a private fundraising campaign to pay for the lab so far his efforts have raised $ 80000 in contributions including about $ 25000 from a fundraiser last week assistant sheriff dennis laducer said friday that department officials were happy to hear of the boards plans to consider funding for the lab but he said it would be best to finance the facility immediately weve been studying this for two years laducer said personally i think the issue has been studied enough after such extensive study laducer said he is unaware of any other genetic testing lab in california the state however is considering a plan for regional genetic labs throughout california one of the items to be studied in roths proposal would be the possibility of orange countys facility being designated as the states regional lab reducing the cost to the county the board must act to ensure that public and private funds are utilized appropriately and that no unnecessary time delays or fiscal waste is made roth wrote in his proposal to the other board members dna testing has been used in criminal trials and investigations in at least 30 states including california dna or deoxyribonucleic acid is the fundamental molecule in human life that carries a genetic code unique to every individual that unique code can be gleaned from dna found in samples of human hair or bodily fluids kyle joseph borges the 29yearold transient construction worker who was arrested tuesday as a suspect in the kidnap and rape in huntington beach was acquitted in a controversial rape trial involving an attack on a housewife in anaheim hills on oct 29 1988 a superior court judge prevented prosecutors from introducing genetic evidence in that case because it would have delayed the trial for several months but deputy dist atty dennis bauer said the genetic evidence was very persuasive and very strong evidence if this is the same guy it would have prevented this kidnap and rape because hed still be in custody bauer said
