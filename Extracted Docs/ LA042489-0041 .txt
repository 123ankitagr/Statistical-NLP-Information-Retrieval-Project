While businesses in New York ranging from the Los Angeles Top Co. to the Malibu Pet Hotel attempt to cash in on the cachet of California names , a finger walk through the White Pages of the Los Angeles telephone directories indicates that the reverse is at least as common . Listings in the Los Angeles phone book show that `` New York '' has cachet in Southern California . The names of no fewer than 52 businesses in the central L.A. phone book begin with `` New York . '' Another 14 are listed in the West Side book . As with the California names in New York , many of the Los Angeles businesses using `` New York '' in their names are clothing stores , suggesting that among apparel buyers the clothes may be more appealing if they 're associated with the other side of the continent . `` New York Surprise '' on South Los Angeles Street turns out to be a women 's clothing store . Others include New York Mink on Olympic Boulevard , New York Fashion in Hollywood and New York Pants on Crenshaw Boulevard . But the listings also suggest that the New York name may help in the marketing of everything from doughnuts to dentures as well . The L.A. phone book lists the New York Bakery , the New Yorker Bakery , New York Pizza and New York Dental Ceramics . There is also Manhattan City Bowling Supplies , a hat store called Manhattan Hattan and the Brooklyn Bagel Bakery . Calls to a few , however , suggest that use of `` New York '' is n't a guarantee of business longevity or success . An employee at the parent firm that owned two firms listed in the L.A. white pages , New York Feather Co. of California and New York Foam Sales , said the company has gotten out of both the feather and foam businesses .
