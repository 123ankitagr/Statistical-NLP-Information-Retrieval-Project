it's not often a coach will attack one of the opposing team's best players but that's exactly what el toro assistant coach kim jagd suggested the chargers do to thousand oaks aimee stone and it worked like a charm el toro 18-3 overcame an opening-game loss to the lancers 18-4 and rallied to win 12-15 15-5 15-7 15-10 and advance to the southern section 5 a semifinals we were picking up what they did offensively and my wife assistant coach kim jagd figured out that no 4 stone had a lot of offensive responsibility el toro head coach mike jagd said so we served at her hoping making the passes and still hitting would put pressure on her it worked as stone had trouble handling the serves forced bad passes and had trouble with kills as well it really takes me time to adjust to things said stone who finished the game with 14 kills and five digs i'll hit 20 kills the same way before i adjust i've got to or should have learned that the chargers ranked second in the final section poll were led by michelle mauney who had 14 kills 10 blocks 13 digs and four aces joe wojciechowski
