I recently read an article on black people of Orange County ( May 10 ) . I was shocked to read some of the statements said about black people . I feel it was misleading information to make black people even less desirable in white society . All of your statements were from black people , ( who ) are confused in their way of thinking . I am a young black man who lives and worked in Orange County . I am well-educated and live in a middle-class neighborhood , so I feel I have some true opinion about the situation in Orange County and how black people feel ( about ) Orange County . Sean Saunders said he does not relate or speak the same language as other black people who resided outside of Orange County . This young man is a prime example of being brainwashed from the white society and his parents have ( played ) a big part in his way of thinking . It does not matter where you live . As long as you have an open mind , you can relate to anyone , if you really want to . Black people must learn to work together as a whole rather than worrying about less-important things such as who 's going to take their daughters to the high school prom . Black people must be able to say , `` I am proud to be a black African-American . '' Robert L. Douglas , Santa Ana
