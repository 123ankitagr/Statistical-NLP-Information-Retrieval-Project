i recently read an article on black people of orange county may 10 i was shocked to read some of the statements said about black people i feel it was misleading information to make black people even less desirable in white society all of your statements were from black people who are confused in their way of thinking i am a young black man who lives and worked in orange county i am welleducated and live in a middleclass neighborhood so i feel i have some true opinion about the situation in orange county and how black people feel about orange county sean saunders said he does not relate or speak the same language as other black people who resided outside of orange county this young man is a prime example of being brainwashed from the white society and his parents have played a big part in his way of thinking it does not matter where you live as long as you have an open mind you can relate to anyone if you really want to black people must learn to work together as a whole rather than worrying about lessimportant things such as whos going to take their daughters to the high school prom black people must be able to say i am proud to be a black africanamerican robert l douglas santa ana
