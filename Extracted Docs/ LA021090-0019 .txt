How dare there be disappointment that Bill Shoemaker did n't win his final race . How dare there be catcalls for winning jockey Eddie Delahoussaye . Shoemaker is enough of a man to have been outraged and embarrassed if the other riders had let him win , and Delahoussaye was only one of three who beat the Shoe . It does n't lessen Shoemaker 's accomplishments at all . PATTI GARRITY , Manhattan Beach
