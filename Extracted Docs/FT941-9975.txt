mr michael heseltine the trade and industry secretary has asked the office of fair trading to seek undertakings from mai to remove competition concerns over its planned acquisition of anglia television the demand is similar to that made in the case of both carlton communications acquisition of central tv and granada's hostile bid for london weekend television in both cases it was decided not to refer the deals to the monopolies and mergers commission as long as the enlarged groups reduced their advertising sales operations to 25 per cent of the total television advertising market by august 1995 anglia's advertising is sold by tsms a sales house that also sells advertising for central and ulster television mai's broadcasting company meridian the south of england itv company sells through merlin mr heseltine said that on the basis of current advice he expected to be able to resolve competition concerns without a reference presumably on the 25 per cent principle the institute of practitioners in advertising has called on granada to divest itself of some of its television advertising sales interests well before next august if it succeeds in taking over lwt allowing current arrangements to continue until then would needlessly increase uncertainty
