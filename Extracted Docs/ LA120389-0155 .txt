A federal judge has refused to impose sanctions against the NFL Management Council for a letter it sent to players concerning their union 's antitrust battle over free agency . U.S. District Judge David Doty also refused to release confidential information that the players claimed would show the league had decided against bargaining with the NFL Players Assn . as far back as 1984 . The undated letter tells players that union strategy to pursue litigation rather than collective bargain is expensive and ineffective . The NFLPA said the letter was `` filled with inaccuracies , omissions and misrepresentations '' and showed why no progress was made in bargaining . The players union filed suit against the league in 1987 after a strike over free agency . The players claimed the free agency plan violated antitrust laws .
