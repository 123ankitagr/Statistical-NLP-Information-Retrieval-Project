That this aging co-ed , with her big hair , big Rolex , big diamonds and big Mercedes wants to dictate her version of morality would be comical if it were n't so frightening . Here we have a woman who wants for nothing ( including first-class air travel to Europe to peddle her self-righteousness ) and it is totally disconnected from reality . I am puzzled by the very term pro-life . She is n't pro-life . She is pro-birth . McMillan does n't consider life an ongoing experience . Once you have the baby , you 're on your own , ladies . The unfortunate mothers then have to contend with a vicious circle of poverty and despair , presumably while Susan is having her roots retouched . JEFFREY G. GENTILE , Torrance
