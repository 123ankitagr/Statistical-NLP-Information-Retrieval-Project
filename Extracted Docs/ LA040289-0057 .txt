There is one important issue that was not addressed in `` Reckless Skiing Is Pursued as a Felony '' ( Part I , March 23 ) . Being a four-year resident of Mammoth Lakes and a four-year resident of Wrightwood ( Mt . High ) I have seen a lot of smoking ( marijuana ) , drinking of alcohol , and on occasion have seen cocaine used on chair lifts and gondolas . Licensing skiers may be a good idea , but skiing under the influence could well be the main culprit of skiing accidents and should , therefore , be addressed in the studies and discussions regarding skier safety on the slopes .
