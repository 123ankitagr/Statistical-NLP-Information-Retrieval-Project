Another US stereotype bites the dust . It 's incorrectly thought by some that the Washington Post automatically endorses Democratic candidates . In fact , it occasionally blesses a moderate Republican or two in its suburban hinterland , like Connie Morella from Maryland , who on four occasions has received the newspaper 's seal of approval . But for the Post , with its great liberal Democratic traditions , to opt for a Republican on its home turf takes a bit of doing . Step forward Marion Barry , Democrat candidate for mayor . The Post has now formally endorsed his Republican opponent , Carol Schwartz , in next month 's election . Close observers of the Post have long thought that Donald Graham , publisher , and Len Downie , editor , have had enough of Barry , now claiming 'personal redemption ' and seeking a fourth term , after being being confined on a cocaine conviction to a federal prison . The opening sentence of its lead editorial endorsing Schwartz even ate some humble pie . 'In 1986 , in an editorial we wish we could take back , this newspaper endorsed Marion Barry for a third term as mayor , ' it said - and then went on to blame him for fiscal and social policy mismanagement on a grand scale . But does the Post 's endorsement help or hinder ? The Morella campaign thought it crucial to her first election in 1986 , though it did n't help John Ray , defeated by Barry in September 's Democratic primary . Though in a city where Republicans are an endangered species , Schwartz is unlikely to complain .
