another us stereotype bites the dust it's incorrectly thought by some that the washington post automatically endorses democratic candidates in fact it occasionally blesses a moderate republican or two in its suburban hinterland like connie morella from maryland who on four occasions has received the newspaper's seal of approval but for the post with its great liberal democratic traditions to opt for a republican on its home turf takes a bit of doing step forward marion barry democrat candidate for mayor the post has now formally endorsed his republican opponent carol schwartz in next month's election close observers of the post have long thought that donald graham publisher and len downie editor have had enough of barry now claiming personal redemption and seeking a fourth term after being being confined on a cocaine conviction to a federal prison the opening sentence of its lead editorial endorsing schwartz even ate some humble pie in 1986, in an editorial we wish we could take back this newspaper endorsed marion barry for a third term as mayor it said and then went on to blame him for fiscal and social policy mismanagement on a grand scale but does the post's endorsement help or hinder the morella campaign thought it crucial to her first election in 1986, though it didn't help john ray defeated by barry in september's democratic primary though in a city where republicans are an endangered species schwartz is unlikely to complain
