your story misleads the reader into believing that our nation's highest court is an unequivocating bastion of support for a woman's right to an abortion recent rulings and remarks by the court show this to be false as the article stated the court case that the supreme court let stand randall terry vs new york state was based on the ku klux klan act of 1871, which forbids depriving any person from exercising a constitutional right thus in letting the lower court's ruling stand the supreme court is merely stating that this was not an appropriate opportunity to challenge roe vs wade and issue a definitive ruling on whether women have a constitutional right to an abortion however such an opportunity will inevitably come and only then will the court's true stand on abortion be revealed john hoxie glendale
