Foster & Lloyd figure they would n't have been around very long in country music if they had shown up about 10 years ago . That 's because nobody in country radio would have played their records . But Radney Foster , who hails from Del Rio , Tex. , and Bill Lloyd , a native of Bowling Green , Ky. , figure that they lucked out . `` We were at the right place at the right time , '' Foster said . Foster & Lloyd are country rockers , or rocking countrians , depending on the way one looks at things . But either way , one thing is clear : Country music fans like 'em . Their current single , `` Fair Shake , '' from their new album `` Faster and Louder , '' is already in the top 10 , following a string of chart successes . They were asked about being on the borderline , the edge of what is considered country and what is not . `` I think we 're just making music we enjoy and were influenced by as kids , '' Foster said . `` Whether it was the rock side of things -- the Beatles and the Byrds -- or the country side of things -- like Buck Owens , Merle Haggard and Glen Campbell -- in the '60s there was tons of stuff on radio . `` Bill and I have been influenced by all those things , and I think we 're trying to throw all those together . `` Obviously , there 's a lot of rock influence and a lot of country influence . It works for us . I do n't think there 's a need to apologize for either one of them . '' Lloyd said `` strict credentials '' are primarily for marketing purposes and not for listening purposes : `` People will listen to whatever they like . And if you present them a good song , they should like it . There 's all kinds of formulas for hit records , but the basic one is , 'Do you like it ? Will you buy it ? ' `` '' Faster & Louder '' has a list of `` guest pickers , '' the two singers said . They include John Cowan and Sam Bush of the New Grass Revival , great dobroist Jerry Douglas , and pop revisionist Marshall Crenshaw . `` We were able to stretch some of the boundaries on songs and think about different ideas , '' said Foster , adding that the album `` was a great experience for me .
