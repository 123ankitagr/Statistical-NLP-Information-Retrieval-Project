seldom does a film festival act as midwife to an entire new sub-genre but at berlin a newcomer screamed into the daylight while critics gasped onlookers applauded and everyone tried to determine whether it was a boy or a girl eventually they blithely shrugged and christened it the gay with a hint of straight movie in each of three high-profile festival films japan's okoge france's les nuits fauves and taiwan's golden bear-winning the wedding banquet a gay relationship is broken into by a heterosexual one real or token and the world has a brief startling glimpse of non-sectarian sexuality cyril collard's les nuits fauves is the most untamed of the films the wild nights are enjoyed by collard himself as the thirtyish hero an hiv-positive film-maker swinging between a teenage girl and a young sportsman unprotected sex abounds the director all but invites you to hiss as his anti hero hops from bed to bed with time off for grope sessions in a gay cruising ground by the seine and unprotected aesthetics are also favoured no genteel cellophaned visuals here as the handheld camera shudders from quarrel to punch-up to romance and back again at best the film is vividly personal like animated pages torn from a diary at worst it can seem like a long session of anarcho-narcissism with a tacked-on moralistic ending as specious as a deathbed repentance either way everyone talked and quarrelled about the film which is exactly how life at a festival should be pick of the far east's two ac dc entries was ang lee's the wedding banquet where takehiro nakejima's okoge is a pleasant but puzzling comedy about a girl's friendship with two gay lovers just why we wonder is she so besotted with them that she trails round tokyo in their wake lends them her spare bedroom purrs at the sound of homo-erotic bliss through the rice-paper walls lee's film takes a similar plot and turns it into a crowd-pleaser that also makes dramatic and psychological sense the hero winston chao a taiwanese yuppie in new york devotes half his emotional energies to living with his gay american lover mitchell lichtenstein of streamers the other half to parrying parental postcards urging marriage one day ma and pa turn up for a two-week visit stashing away the gay calendars and muscle magazines the lovers masquerade as flatmates then a taiwanese girl painter who wants a green card to stay in america is roped in as bride for a let's-make the-folks-happy wedding there are loud laughs in this comedy with sentimental trimmings but for a two-hour chunk of feelgood cinema it also succeeds in avoiding false notes when the lies and masquerades come unstuck the story totters towards human disaster only to right itself by going deeper into the characters rather than blanding them out for a happy ending the wedding banquet shared an all-eastern golden bear with the lake of scented souls reviewed by me last week justice was done nothing else in the berlin competition sent one out glowing like these two films indeed much moviegoing was like dancing over hot coals as you avoided one clinker another lay in awful wait you winced as you stepped on holland's the homecoming a darkly ludicrous murder film shot as if by the light of a single candle then you scraped your sole painfully on nordic angst in norway's the telegraphist or denmark sweden's heartache outside the competition life was more dependable there was a cluster of good retrospectives cinemascope billy wilder gregory peck there were mr wilder and mr peck themselves on show and there was king kong growling away atop the festival theatre oh and there was one final interesting oddity in the competition it was andrew birkin's the cement garden ian mcewan's novel about incest gardening and unusual burial procedures look for mum inside the metal locker filled with cement is filmed in a grey toneless but oddly bewitching sfumato as if through clouds of opium smoke since the film was co-produced by france and germany there are incongruous euro-actors notably charlotte gainsbourg birkin's niece as the daughter but someone has done a fine dubbing job they all sound as if they come the grungier reaches of british suburbia and an initially unpromising film ends up holding you in sickly sepulchral thrall
