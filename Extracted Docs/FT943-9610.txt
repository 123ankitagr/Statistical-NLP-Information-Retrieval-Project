the signing of an aircraft manufacturing deal this week between china and boeing marks a further significant penetration by the wests aerospace industry into chinas rapidly expanding civil aviation business like its competitors boeing knows that in signing its biggest manufacturing agreement with china involving chinese production of a fuselage section of the us manufacturers popular 737 twin engine airliner it is playing for high stakes there is big money for western manufacturers and airlines in what has become the worlds thirdlargest aviation market after the us and japan for china the stakes are equally high boeings increasing involvement in the countrys aviation sector together with other international airlines and manufacturers should improve air safety after an era in which standards have been sacrificed for rapid growth since the beijing government sanctioned the development of regional airlines in the 1980s a combination of lax regulation and heady expansion has led to an alarming number of fatal air crashes what we are seeing is an industry trying to do it all at once said mr tom gallagher a senior vicepresident of the us chase manhattan bank the chinese are trying to set up airlines build airports buy aircraft train pilots and develop maintenance capability and a safe and unified air traffic control system while air traffic grows by more than 20 per cent a year this adds up to a most daunting task will china be able to pull it off mr gallagher asked recently some 500 people have died in air crashes in china since 1992 the accident in june involving a china northwest airlines russianbuilt tupolev tu154 killing 160 people again focused attention on what the chinese civil aviation authorities had warned were inadequate airline safety standards only a few days before the china northwest crash near the historic city of xian the worst in the countrys history the new head of the civil aviation administration of china launched an air safety drive after revealing that several tens of nearaccidents had occurred this year including aircraft going off runways and engines stopping in midair the chinese have realised they have been getting a bit thin to ensure safety standards and they have decided to curb growth a little to ensure better safety said mr pierre jeanniot directorgeneral of the international air transport association iata the trade organisation grouping 224 airlines which china joined last year the unfavourable attention drawn to chinas air safety record by the xian crash is expected to hasten a process already under way chinese airlines are seeking closer ties with foreign carriers to help them upgrade safety and cabin service as well as securing greater cooperation between china and western aircraft manufacturers china recently announced it was opening its aviation sector including airlines airport terminals maintenance and catering facilities to foreign involvement with a 35 per cent ceiling on foreign investment while representatives of foreign carriers are scouring the country looking for joint ventures establishing partnerships will not be easy given the gap between business cultures and operating procedures in spite of the difficulties several foreign carriers are lining up to do business in china british airways is among a group of large international airlines stepping up efforts to participate in the modernisation and expansion of the chinese airline market we feel there are considerable longterm opportunities in china said mr david holmes bas director of government and international affairs ba is already cooperating with china southern the guangzhoubased carrier and one of the eight largest chinese airlines operating western aircraft ba has formed a joint engineering venture with china southern and has recently sold the airline computer services it is also talking with shanghaibased china eastern airlines about pilot training engineering and computer reservation systems although ba is not pushing at this stage to take a stake in one or more chinese airlines its longerterm ambition is to negotiate a marketing agreement with a large chinese carrier to coordinate services at beijing airport qantas the australian carrier in which ba has acquired a 25 per cent stake is targeting smaller regional carriers and has been in discussion with airlines in shenzhen shanghai and yunan but officials stress these are only preliminary talks lufthansa of germany was among the first big international airlines to invest in china its maintenance joint venture with air china at beijing airport called ameco the aircraft maintenance and engineering corporation employs nearly 4000 people also in beijing the german carrier recently inaugurated an aeronautical apprentice training centre it has also opened an office shopping and hotel complex in the chinese capital the us lockheed group and hutchison china trade holdings are involved in an aircraft maintenance venture with china southern in the south of the country singapore airlines sia cathay pacific and japan airlines have invested in a maintenance facility with xiamen airlines south of shanghai china is one of the three major growth areas we have targeted for the next decade together with india and vietnam said dr cheong choong kong sias managing director sia one of the worlds consistently profitable airlines has been approached by several chinese carriers and has already provided technical cooperation to chinese regional airlines for the past five years it has recently taken a 40 per cent stake in beijing airports ground handling service company and another 40 per cent stake in beijing airports inflight kitchen company providing meals for airlines operating in and out of the capital these initiatives will almost certainly be just the beginning of more extensive links between chinese carriers and foreign airlines and service organisations most of chinas airlines are looking for assistance in a number of important areas such as pilot training engineering and maintenance and ground and cabin service training explained the beijing representative of a large european carrier chinas increasing preoccupation with safety and improving industry standards is also expected to continue encouraging chinese carriers to buy modern western airliners recent studies indicate that china will experience explosive growth in demand for western aircraft with one forecast predicting a fivefold increase to the year 2010 in the countrys current commercial aircraft fleet of about 350 airliners according to chase manhattan chinas requirements in the next 15 years might exceed 1200 new aircraft worth dollars 90bn this is far more than previous forecasts by among others boeing which predicts demand for 800 aircraft worth dollars 40bn and the european airbus consortium which expects china to buy 620 aircraft between now and 2011 to replace older largely sovietbuilt aircraft and provide capacity for growth chases forecast is based on passenger growth of 20 per cent annually until 1998 dropping to 15 per cent a year to 2004 and then to 10 per cent a year in the six years to 2010 however after surging 33 per cent in 1992 passenger growth slowed to less than 20 per cent last year in part reflecting the credit squeeze instituted by the chinese authorities last july even if chases assessment proves to be wildly optimistic there is no doubt that the chinese market will continue to be the world aviation industrys biggest prize for the foreseeable future in 1974 the countrys civil aviation fleet had just 12 aircraft last year alone boeing delivered 46 airliners to china or 14 per cent of its 1993 production totalling 330 aircraft china will take delivery of 36 additional aircraft this year which again will account for 14 per cent of boeings total 260 airliners this year boeing staff also provide support for boeing aircraft in 13 cities throughout china the us manufacturer trained more than 800 pilots and maintenance engineers from china last year is advising the chinese authorities on air traffic control systems and procedures and since 1980 has bought parts made in china for its aircraft programmes boeings european rival airbus clinched orders worth about dollars 12bn last year and now has three chinese airlines operating airbus equipment including china eastern in shanghai china northwest in xian and china northern in shenyang in addition two chinese manufacturers the shenyang aircraft corporation and the xian aircraft company make parts for airbus aircraft mcdonnell douglas the other us airliner manufacturer has also sought to build close ties with china through joint production of md82 twinengine 150seat airliners with the shanghai aviation industrial corporation chinas market is not only proving a bonanza for aircraft manufacturers but for suppliers of a whole range of aviation equipment rollsroyce for example is supplying 42 of its rb211535 powerplants for boeing 757s bought by chinese airlines and says it is confident of winning further orders but chinas current policy of buying or leasing new or virtually new equipment is proving expensive especially when considering the low utilisation rate of modern western aircraft by chinese airlines the chase study shows that average aircraft utilisation in china remains low rising from only 47 hours a day in 1990 to 52 hours in 1992 this compares with 11 hours for sia 10 hours for cathay pacific and 8 hours for korean airlines such a low aircraft utilisation rate is largely the result of the countrys inadequate infrastructure notably air traffic control the number and condition of airports airspace limitations and the need for better trained ground and flight personnel it should eventually improve if china goes ahead with ambitious plans to upgrade 50 airports during the next 10 years as well as build an additional 90 airports to bring the total to about 200 by the end of the decade at present there are 109 airports in operation of which only 40 have instrumentlanding systems and only 12 can handle boeing 747 jumbo aircraft the cost of operating new fleets of westernbuilt aircraft will also inevitably increase as the maintenance holiday that comes with a young fleet gradually disappears in turn this will put additional pressure on building new maintenance facilities and training personnel for this reason chase recommends that chinese airlines consider in the short term at least buying or leasing used western aircraft the high cost of modernising and expanding its aviation industry has prompted china and its airlines to seek overseas capital shanghaibased china eastern and guangzhoubased china southern are among 22 chinese companies selected for stock market listing abroad xian aircraft manufacturing chinas biggest aerospace company is also one of the chosen 22 china southern is said by aviation industry observers to have advanced furthest in preparation for a new york stock exchange listing but recent reports suggest that china eastern may be allowed to go first goldman sachs and morgan stanley the wall street investment banks have been advising china southern and china eastern respectively in what are certain to be highprofile listings while chinas poor air safety record may deter some investors hong kong stock market experts believe this is unlikely to have a significant impact on the offer price the industrys centre of gravity is moving east and a lot of future growth will come from china says iata directorgeneral mr jeanniot but he also warns that the dilemma facing chinese civil aviation is that with annual growth rates of 20 to 30 per cent you simply cant acquire experience that rapidly privatisation can provide a solution to funding problems but it can not resolve air safety issues as mr jeanniot emphasises one area of aviation you will never be able to
