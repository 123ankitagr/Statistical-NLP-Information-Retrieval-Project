at a bar in downtown bombay hundreds of teenagers swing and sing along to the music of mtv seeing wild images on the indian television set that had otherwise censored even a kiss in new delhi the main topic of discussion at a ladies card party is what happens next in the two soaps that have most of urban india hooked the bold and the beautiful and santa barbara and the drab images and stale news of the nine o'clock news on state-owned television has been upstaged by the bbc's slick news coverage on the hour satellite television has taken india by storm and it is only a year since hong kong's star satellite television asian region tv first beamed its test channel to a country where television viewers had never had the luxury of switching channels a recent survey by the hong kong-based market research firm frank small and associates shows that india is star's biggest viewer other countries in the the satellite footprint include hong kong israel korea pakistan philippines and taiwan with 1,282,500 homes having access to the network by june 1992 this is a phenomenal increase of 211 per cent over star tv's access to only 412,500 homes in january this year making star's marketing team who visited india last month confident that the network grows in india by 5,800 homes a day even a year ago government officials who controlled the state-owned doordarshan had dismissed the satellite and cable invasion saying that only the very rich would be able to afford it and they had access to video anyway today the short-sighted attitude of government officials who felt they knew best what indians should watch has meant that fewer people are watching the dull entertainment and political propaganda that indian television has been dishing out since the late sixties when a national television network was established in the country star tv offers four 24-hour channels the entertainment star plus bbc's asia service prime sports and music videos on mtv most cable operators who sell star by subscription the average monthly rate is rs120 pounds 2 offer an extra cable channel showing popular hindi cinema which is still the largest draw for indian audiences perceiving this and realising the vast advertising potential that india has to offer star will shortly provide a fifth channel zee tv a hindi entertainment channel which will run the latest hits from india's film industry apart from star indian cable operators offer the american cnn which is far less popular and ptv a pakistan television network which has worried the government about the effect of political propaganda from across the border also though the government is still complacent that it will be a long time before star and other television networks give indians especially in the villages access to uncensored news and unabashed entertainment television experts reckon that at least a third of india will have access to satellite television by the end of the century making it part of the global village virtually overnight though much of star's fare is mediocre at least people have a choice without state censorship
