Randy Owen , lead singer for the country group Alabama , says that when he shows the cattle he raises , livestock judges do not seem to give his entries equal consideration . `` Many do n't take us seriously , '' Owen said . `` They think I 'm doing this as a hobby . '' Owen , whose cattle were competing this week in the prestigious Southwestern Exposition and Livestock Show and Rodeo , said he was raised a cowboy . `` I could n't afford to show cattle when I was growing up , but now that I 've got a chance , I make a point of trying to make it to shows we are in , '' he said . The 40-year-old Owen 's polled Hereford heifers did not win any major prize money or award ribbons Wednesday .
