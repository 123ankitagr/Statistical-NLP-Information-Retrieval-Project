The Laguna Playhouse had to scramble late Tuesday afternoon to find a substitute for actress Colleen Dunn , who had to drop out of `` Quilters '' because of a medical emergency . Playhouse artistic director Douglas Rowe said Dunn was rushed to Saddleback Memorial Medical Center in Laguna Hills at 4:30 a.m. Tuesday for an appendectomy . `` We 've cast another actress , Cameron Ahia , '' said Rowe , who noted that there are no understudies for any of the seven women in the show . `` Most of Colleen 's lines will be divided among the other actresses . '' In a `` Quilters '' review Tuesday , roles played by Dunn and Carolyn Miller were inadvertently reversed . Dunn played the old-maid schoolteacher ; Miller , who was credited with that role , played the handsome cowboy .
