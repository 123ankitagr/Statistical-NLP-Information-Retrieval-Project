I really wonder what was going through Melissa Henry 's mind when she wrote her letter ( `` Enough already with the letters from incensed New Kids on the Block fans ! '' Calendar , Nov. 10 ) . Her letter comes as no surprise in an adult society where no one does much of anything except complain about students ' falling test scores and other shortcomings of today 's young people . The letters we write as New Kids fans allow us to give back to them in some minute way . In our hearts , we know we have done the right thing by defending them . Everything comes to pass anyway , but for now , let the New Kids fans exercise their right to freedom of speech . MICHELLE PARKINSON Anaheim
