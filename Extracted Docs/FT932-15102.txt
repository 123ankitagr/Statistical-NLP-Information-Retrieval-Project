Patsy Bloom , managing director of Pet Plan , was yesterday named the 1992 Veuve Clicquot Business Woman of the Year . Her company , which specialises in insuring small animals and horses , was set up 16 years ago with a Pounds 250 loan when Bloom discovered that no company would insure her dog . Pet Plan now holds 51 per cent of the small animal market and a large slice of the leisure horse market ; the concept is franchised in Italy and Canada . Turnover has increased from Pounds 7.8m in 1989 to a projected Pounds 20m in 1992 . Previous winners of the award include Anita Roddick , founder of the Body Shop , and Ann Gloag , founder of Stagecoach .
