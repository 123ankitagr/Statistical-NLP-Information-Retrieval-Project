this month the south bank takes another musical stride towards the millennium in seven-league boots cobbled by nicholas snowman simon rattle and the late michael vyner as you may remember their plan for the decade is to have an annual survey of all the decades of our century one by one it will culminate in 2000 ad with music of the 1990 s this year is the turn of the 1920 s to which several concerts are devoted on wednesday rattle and his city of birmingham symphony led off with middle-period varese late-middle berg the 1924 wozzeck suite and gershwin and early shostakovich all quite disparate though it was a pretty idea to set the varese ameriques 1921 his first new york piece against an american in paris 1928 those works passed each other by like ships in the night and the precocious soviet composer and the decadent schoenberg pupil were locked into their own musical cultures yes mahler was to be a common factor but shostakovich began to appreciate his music only two years after his own first symphony 1925 at about the time when he was hearing wozzeck appreciatively in leningrad in rattle's hands the shostakovich first revealed few signs of latent mahlerianism there really is a kinship of pawky irony to be found in the opening allegretto not however at rattle's indifferently hasty tempo which left the most characteristic ideas either over-emphatic or just under-pointed far more sympathy was lavished upon the wozzeck fragments many poignant beautifully wrought details though the soprano elise ross brought only a concert-singer's careful address to marie's solos with no raw drama incarnated in the voice rattle sounded still more engaged by the broad hit-or-miss expanse of ameriques with its full outre orchestral complement to knock us over then in properly disarming fashion gershwin's american tourist crashed in strutted flirted brashly and won all hearts on monday at the barbican the ukrainian conductor fedor glushchenko had taken the english chamber orchestra through a not dissimilar programme of a later date but tamer airs arvo part's early cantus in memory of benjamin britten unwound in accordance with its minimalist formula to moderately gripping effect with more deliberate precision it can seem more magically suspended and luminous than that equally tchaikovsky's mozartiana transcriptions would have gained by some wry detachment though the clarinet and violin cadenzas were vividly projected as soloist in shostakovich's first cello concerto 1959 rafael wallfisch was gracefully eloquent the orchestral accompaniment was too reticent to prompt him toward any more candid display of feeling he still managed to do impressive justice to his grand cadenza-movement and for the first public performance of david matthews romanza op 49, commissioned for the queen mother's 90 th birthday and duly performed at buckingham palace by rostropovich in august 1990, wallfisch responded perfectly to the manner of the score more than any david matthews score until his very latest ones romanza has an audibly contemporary basis not mere nostalgia for the gestures of between-the-wars british music but loyal affection for them refracted from a candid irrevocable distance to hear matthews admit to being a modern composer perhaps against his natural bent was a real satisfaction for him like the rest of us it is too late for naive returns to past modes but it is possible to revive them in knowing inverted-commas
