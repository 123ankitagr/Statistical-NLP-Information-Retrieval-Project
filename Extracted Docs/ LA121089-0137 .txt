After months-long protests from the NAACP that blacks are not represented in top administrative posts in Carson city government , City Administrator Jack Smith has chosen a black woman , Lorraine A. Oten , as finance director . Smith , who is white , said that Oten , 53 , who is leaving a position as finance director of Lynwood , `` was selected solely on her experience and skills . '' But he added that he was pleased that Oten would add balance to the administrative team . `` It does something to appease a segment of our community who were crying out for more representation , '' he said . In Carson city government , four white males and an Asian male are the other appointed department heads , and the deputy city administrator is an Asian male . The elected city clerk is an Asian female , and the elected city treasurer is a white female . Smith said that in filling the position , the city personnel department `` intensified our efforts to recruit in all segments of society . In the last six or seven months , we have made a very diligent effort to get the word out . '' Oten , whose salary range is from $ 60,000 to $ 77,000 , starts works Tuesday .
