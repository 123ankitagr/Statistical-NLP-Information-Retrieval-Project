the organisation for economic co-operation and development oecd has launched a campaign to reduce huge differences in export credit insurance premiums charged by its members which distort free competition in sales from the industrialised to the developing world oecd headquarters in paris has invited trade officials from its 24 member countries to meet next autumn to share information on six or seven third world countries to which the costs of export credit insurance vary widely between different oecd exporters meetings to exchange information on commercials risks in other third world markets are expected to follow officials are unwilling to give precise examples of which countries charge too little or too much however a recent oecd study shows that premiums on export credit insurance to one african country vary between oecd members from a minimum of 6 per cent to a maximum of 26 per cent of contract value it is complete chaos there are very large differences which are commercially inexplicable said an official if the meetings are successful oecd officials believe export credit insurance premiums within the industrialised bloc should converge over the next few years patchy information on third world market risks accounts for most of the differences said an oecd expert the study shows no evidence of attempts by the governments of exporting countries to subsidise overseas sales by encouraging providers of export credit guarantees often state-owned to charge unrealistically low premiums however the move is consistent with a separate oecd campaign which is aimed at preventing governments from mixing aid funds with commercial credits so as to win export markets
