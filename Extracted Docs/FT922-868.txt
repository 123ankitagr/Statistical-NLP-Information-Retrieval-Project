A BITTER fares war has broken out between rail and coach operators on the London-Glasgow and London-Edinburgh routes following British Rail 's decision to introduce a Pounds 29 return ticket . National Express , the coach company , yesterday accused BR of abusing its position as a nationalised industry by charging uneconomic prices . It also cut its cheapest fares on the two routes to Pounds 25 return from Pounds 30 for seats booked at least seven days in advance . BR 's ordinary second-class return fare between London and Glasgow or Edinburgh is Pounds 114 . On some trains a 'saver ' fare of Pounds 67 is available ; on others a 'super-saver ' fare of Pounds 57 ; and an 'apex ' fare of Pounds 44 is offered to passengers who book at least seven days in advance . Last month , BR launched a direct attack on the coach market with a 'super-apex ' return which has to be booked 14 days in advance . At Pounds 29 , it undercut the coach fare by Pounds 1 . Caledonian Express , the Scottish arm of National Express , yesterday labelled this ' a blatant attempt to steal our passengers at prices that can not be justified ' . Mr Bernard Davis , Caledonian Express marketing director , claimed BR could not cover its overheads at Pounds 29 a ticket . 'As a nationalised concern , they appear to be ignoring commercial reality , especially now that privatisation is the key issue in their future . ' British Rail 's InterCity sector strongly denied that the fares were uneconomic . The 'super-apex ' fare had been introduced to fill under-capacity trains with passengers who would not otherwise have travelled by rail . 'The ticket has been highly successful in attracting passengers from the coaches . But we have no plans to undercut their latest fare . '
