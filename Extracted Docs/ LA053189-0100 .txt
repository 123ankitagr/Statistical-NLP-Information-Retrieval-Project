The Louisiana House killed a bill that would have abolished state affirmative action programs , handing state Rep. David Duke , a former Ku Klux Klan leader , his first legislative defeat since winning his seat in a special election in February . Duke , a Republican from Metairie , branded the House action as `` cowardice . '' The measure , which also would have banned state contract set-aside programs for minorities , had been approved by a House committee , but the full House voted 44 to 41 in a procedural move to table the bill , effectively killing it . The motion to table was made by Rep. Mitch Landrieu , a New Orleans Democrat whose district contains a large percentage of blacks . Duke vowed to fight to have his measure tacked onto another bill as an amendment .
