ulysses the first spacecraft to break free from the plane of our solar system will reach the climax of a 3bn km voyage today when it flies above the south pole of the sun the dollars 750m pounds 480m ulysses mission is a joint project of the us and european space agencies dedicated to exploring the heliosphere this region contains mainly ions charged atoms and electrons emanating from the sun a bubble blown inside the extremely thin cold gas of interstellar space by the suns hot breath the solar wind it encompasses the whole solar system except for the planets and their atmospheres because the planets were formed from a disc of debris around the newborn sun about 5bn years ago they all lie within one plane known as the ecliptic which is tilted only slightly from the suns equatorial plane to explore the solar wind and magnetic field free of the turbulence and other complications caused by the planets john simpson of the university of chicago proposed in 1959 sending a space probe over the suns poles the idea became technically feasible in the 1970s and in 1977 the european space agency agreed to collaborate with nasa on the ulysses project no rocket is strong enough on its own to send a spacecraft out of the ecliptic because it has to cancel earths motion around the sun of 30 kmsec and build up speed in a new direction but ulysses designers realised that they could use the gravitational pull of the giant planet jupiter to propel their carsized probe into a new plane like a slingshot see diagram all went well from 1977 until 1980 when the project began an odyssey of setbacks and delays caused mainly by technical and financial difficulties at nasa ulysses was eventually launched on a space shuttle in october 1990 seven and a half years after the original target date once in space ulysses performed perfectly project scientists took advantage of its swing past jupiter in february 1992 to make the first detailed survey of the gigantic system of electrical currents particles and magnetic fields surrounding the planet on route to the suns south pole the nine scientific instruments on ulysses have already made important discoveries about the heliosphere shock waves in the solar wind electromagnetic waves with a very long period more than 10 hours regular bursts of energetic particles from the sun enormous clouds of ionised gas and unexpected patterns of cosmic radiation from elsewhere in the galaxy the investigators are still working out the significance of these observations this is our first ever birds eye view of the suns magnetic poles says roger bonnet esas science director this new perspective will cast some light on the origins of the solar wind and is going to improve our models of the solar interior it may also enable us to anticipate better the variations of solar activity and forecast their effect on earth he adds for example ulysses may give some clues about the impact of the 11year sunspot cycle on terrestrial climate although the mission has taken so long to gestate and execute some oldtimers are still involved willis meeks nasas ulysses project manager has been working on it for 16 years and simpson the father of ulysses is in charge of the largest of the nine experiments which looks at the behaviour of cosmic rays in the solar wind i have had plenty of opportunities to fly experiments on other missions he says but ulysses remains unique as the first and only foreseeable mission to the polar regions of the suns heliosphere the spacecrafts new polar orbit will carry it over the suns north pole next summer although current plans call for the mission to end in october 1995 esa and nasa are keen to continue observing until the end of 2001 they say the modest extra cost dollars 50m would pay large scientific dividends because the current observations coincide with a quiet period on the sun whereas 20002001 will be a period of maximum solar activity whatever happens next ulysses has already paid off in simpsons eyes we dont have to wonder any longer whether the results will justify the effort and reward the long wait he says we already know they do
