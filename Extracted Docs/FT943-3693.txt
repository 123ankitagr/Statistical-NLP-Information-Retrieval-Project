ulysses first spacecraft break free plane solar system reach climax 3bn km voyage today flies south pole sun the dollars 750m pounds 480m ulysses mission joint project us european space agencies dedicated exploring heliosphere this region contains mainly ions charged atoms electrons emanating sun bubble blown inside extremely thin cold gas interstellar space suns hot breath solar wind it encompasses whole solar system except planets atmospheres because planets formed disc debris around newborn sun 5bn years ago lie within one plane known ecliptic tilted slightly suns equatorial plane to explore solar wind magnetic field free turbulence complications caused planets john simpson university chicago proposed 1959 sending space probe suns poles the idea became technically feasible 1970s 1977 european space agency agreed collaborate nasa ulysses project no rocket strong enough send spacecraft ecliptic cancel earths motion around sun 30 kmsec build speed new direction but ulysses designers realised could use gravitational pull giant planet jupiter propel carsized probe new plane like slingshot see diagram all went well 1977 1980 project began odyssey setbacks delays caused mainly technical financial difficulties nasa ulysses eventually launched space shuttle october 1990 seven half years original target date once space ulysses performed perfectly project scientists took advantage swing past jupiter february 1992 make first detailed survey gigantic system electrical currents particles magnetic fields surrounding planet on route suns south pole nine scientific instruments ulysses already made important discoveries heliosphere shock waves solar wind electromagnetic waves long period 10 hours regular bursts energetic particles sun enormous clouds ionised gas unexpected patterns cosmic radiation elsewhere galaxy the investigators still working significance observations this first ever birds eye view suns magnetic poles says roger bonnet esas science director this new perspective cast light origins solar wind going improve models solar interior it may also enable us anticipate better variations solar activity forecast effect earth adds for example ulysses may give clues impact 11year sunspot cycle terrestrial climate although mission taken long gestate execute oldtimers still involved willis meeks nasas ulysses project manager working 16 years and simpson father ulysses charge largest nine experiments looks behaviour cosmic rays solar wind i plenty opportunities fly experiments missions says but ulysses remains unique first foreseeable mission polar regions suns heliosphere the spacecrafts new polar orbit carry suns north pole next summer although current plans call mission end october 1995 esa nasa keen continue observing end 2001 they say modest extra cost dollars 50m would pay large scientific dividends current observations coincide quiet period sun whereas 20002001 period maximum solar activity whatever happens next ulysses already paid simpsons eyes we dont wonder longer whether results justify effort reward long wait says we already know
