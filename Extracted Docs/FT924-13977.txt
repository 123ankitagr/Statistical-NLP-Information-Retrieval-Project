sir samuel brittans article what i would do as chancellor october 8 ends with the suggestion that the conflict between gdp exchange rate and inflation targets may be irreconcilable there is no need for this note of despair provided one makes a distinction between those variables which are intermediate targets used as guides for shortterm policy and medium to longterm goals the exchange rate is surely in the former category i doubt people felt happier when pounds 1 was dm1176 or in 1923 when pounds 1 was rm1010 than they do now on the other hand inflation and output are the latter category and most economists would agree with mr brittan that they are best combined into a target for money gdp the exchange rate has an important influence on money gdp and the most obvious thing to do is to use the exchange rate target as a shortterm guide to interest rate policy while varying the exchange rate target with reference to current performance of money gdp obviously this is not compatible with a permanently fixed exchange rate but it is compatible with membership of an erm in which realignments are seen as a matter of course and not as the worst crisis since dunkirk to relegate fiscal policy in the way that mr brittan does is surely a mistake if money gdp were on course to grow at target rate with the old exchange rate the devaluation must have raised the rate of growth of money gdp and a fiscal contraction is needed to offset this of course if money gdp were growing too slowly at the old rate then a change in the exchange rate must have been a good not bad idea the combination of a money gdp target with some measure of saving like public saving or the psbr requires joint use of monetary and fiscal policy if the two instruments are separated there is a risk that the monetary authority will find itself having to offset the effects of fiscal policy on monetary gdp while the fiscal authority has to offset the effects of the monetary policy on the budget balance for this reason i hope he is too busy as chancellor to push through his bank of england act m r weale faculty of economics and politics university of cambridge
