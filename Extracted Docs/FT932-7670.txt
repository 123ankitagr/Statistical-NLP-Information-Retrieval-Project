THE BANK of Portugal , the central bank , yesterday lowered the central bank discount rate and its bond reference rate for the first time in five years , writes Peter Wise in Lisbon . The discount rate was brought down from 14.5 per cent to 13.5 per cent and the bond reference rate from 16 to 14.5 per cent . The discount rate is a little used non-binding reference rate with little impact on the money markets . Today , the central bank 's main intervention rates are its liquidity mop-up rate and liquidity injection rates , now at 13 and 13.75 per cent respectively . The bond reference rate is widely used in both private and public bond issues . The bank has been encouraged by falling inflation : the year-on-year rate for April fell to 6.2 per cent , the lowest since 1973 .
