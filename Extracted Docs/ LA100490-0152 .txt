Neighborhoods that draw complaints about repeated traffic violations will be targeted with signs and special police enforcement under a new program approved Tuesday by the City Council . The blue signs , which feature a silhouette of a police motorcycle , say `` Special Traffic Enforcement Area '' and ask motorists to `` Please Obey All Laws . '' They will be posted in areas with traffic problems such as speeding or failure to stop for stop signs , Police Capt . Robert Page said . Along with the signs , there will be a heavy police presence in those areas for 30 days , Page said . If the traffic problems do not diminish , the program can be extended . Up to 10 special enforcement areas can be established in the city at one time , Page said .
