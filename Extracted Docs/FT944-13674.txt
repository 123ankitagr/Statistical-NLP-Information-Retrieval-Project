susie a new york-based stockbroker working for a european bank kept leaving messages on the answerphone of a potential client after six months the client rang her and told her he only dealt with us banks her story shows just how prevalent answerphones and voice mailboxes are becoming in us business not only as a means for staff to receive messages when they are absent from their desks but also as a way of filtering calls voice mail and answerphones are also becoming more common in europe where growing call volumes are turning the telephone into a mixed blessing according to uk high street retailer dixons among the most popular answering machines are those which add a date and time to each message with a little help from a computer-generated voice the cheapest of these is a pounds 39.99 machine from betacom bt's response 50 goes a step further by bleeping when any messages have been left but it may not be necessary to buy a separate answering machine at all increasingly answering machines are being included in composite products such as amstrad's model which combines one with a fax machine the latest multimedia home pc from compaq includes an answerphone with 12 segments so that parents for instance do not have to waste time listening to messages meant for their children for the corporate environment voice messaging systems provide similar features to answerphones but can do much more at their simplest they allow callers to leave a message if the person they want to talk to is not available by dialing the appropriate voice mailbox number and a code users can play messages back or forward them to another mailbox but all too often systems are implemented poorly leading to horror stories of voice mail jail where the caller is trapped in the system and bounced from one voice mailbox to another however individual users can be at fault as a consequence some us companies have appointed voice mail police these are staff tasked with spying on colleagues to see if they are changing their greetings regularly for instance when they are on holiday and actually listening to their messages the penalty for breaking the rules is to lose your voice mailbox and once again be subjected to a barrage of calls another potential problem with voice mail is security this is because depending on how they are set up pabxs switchboards with integrated voice mail can be vulnerable to hackers if special tones are used to operate a voice mailbox these can sometimes be used to operate the pabx in this way a number of hackers have used us company switchboards to run up huge bills the voice messaging educational committee vmec whose members include at t bt mobile octel communications and vmx will publish a guide to voice mail security next month in spite of security problems use of voice mail is expanding in the us a study there by the voice systems consultancy vanguard communications says that the us voice mail industry grew over 20 per cent last year with sales topping dollars 1.2 bn don van doren president of vanguard says the bottom line is that voice mail improves communication saving time and money in europe the profile of public voice messaging is increasing largely because cellular phone operators provide voice mailboxes linked to users mobile phones the market for voice processing as a whole including voice messaging is growing at 35-40 per cent a year in europe according to robin scurlock head of bis strategic decision's messaging programme he says at this year's voice 94 show much of the technology that had been promised was on display especially in the area of call centres and voice integration on the local-area network call centre systems are designed to capture the three out of every four calls that the voice messaging industry estimates fail to get through first time the systems are designed to allocate calls to the next free person in a telesales environment and to provide a computer screen full of information on any customer that has called before they can also provide a list of calls which need to be made in the area of voice integration gpt launched a product at voice 94 which allows users on a pc network to get a list of all their fax voice and electronic mail messages they can then use a mouse to click on the ones they want to see or hear suppliers which have or are developing integrated products for the desktop include vmx octel communications c3 applied technology dialogic active voice radish communications and converse however elaine cascio a consultant at vanguard communications warns that no one really knows whether users want to be able to see all their different types of messages at once there are many different types of voice processing of which voice mail is one they go by a confusing array of names and there is some overlap between them audiotex is one of the simplest categories and is used for 0898 recorded information such as racing results another category is interactive voice response ivr this is the type of technology used in some home banking and home shopping systems it might for example prompt the use to press one to check your bank balance or press two to order a cheque book these systems effectively link a voice interface to a computer database they allow customers to input and retrieve information either by using a touch-tone phone or by using speech recognition technology interest in voice technology is growing as computers and telecommunications begin to converge for example pc software companies like microsoft and novell are muscling in and trying to set competing standards for cti computer telephony integration but national character plays a big part in the level of adoption bis says people in the netherlands and sweden are less keen to talk to machines than the english americans are probably the most comfortable with speaking to machines in japan it might be hard to find an executive willing to leave messages on an answerphone for six months scurlock says in japan the receptionist often takes the message verbally and then records it on a machine copies of vmec's voice mail security guide can be obtained from any vmec member company or from vanguard communications in the us tel 201 605 8000
