british scientists have developed an experimental vaccine for bowel cancer the second most common cause of cancer deaths in industrialised countries it is being tested first as a potential treatment for patients with advanced cancer but could be used eventually as a preventive vaccine for people known to be genetically at risk from colo-rectal bowel cancer the cancer research campaign which funded the vaccine's development at nottingham university said yesterday the first clinical trials indicate impressive results in patients imclone systems a new york biotechnology company has signed an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with the crc for commercial development of vaccine 105 ad7 as it is known imclone is a leader in the fast-growing research field of cancer vaccines it is also testing vaccines for lung cancer and melanoma dr lindy durrant and dr adrian robbins who developed 105 ad7 at nottingham said it not only had the potential to prevent bowel cancer or stop the disease progressing but also had the advantage of producing no toxic side-effects unlike conventional treatments the encouraging first results came from tests on a dozen patients with advanced bowel cancer they will be published next week the crc is now organising a larger clinical trial based at nottingham with 350 patients and imclone will carry out an extensive trial in the us even if the new vaccine continues to perform well it is unlikely to be approved as a commercial treatment of bowel cancer before 1997 its use in preventive vaccination might then follow four years later there are several ways in which researchers are planning to use vaccines to prevent cancer one is the indirect approach immunising people against viruses such as epstein barr which are associated with certain cancers the crc-imclone approach on the other hand is aimed directly at tumour cells vaccine 105 ad7 is designed to mimic a particular part of the cell surface this primes the patient's immune system to recognise and attack the cancer cells themselves every year more than 28,000 people in the uk are diagnosed as having bowel cancer only 9,000 will be alive five years later in the us the disease kills 55,000 people a year bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in the west said prof gordon mcvie crc scientific director
