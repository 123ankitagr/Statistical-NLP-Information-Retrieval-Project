ive been the no 1 dj in paris and the no 1 dj in london says mike pasternak alias emperor rosko id like to become the no 1 dj in la but thats no easy thing to do pasternak sits in the broadcasting studio in his thousand oaks home around him is all the right equipment turntables cd player sound effects gadgets stacked against the wall are newly released records sent gratis from labels in the us and europe he even has fan mail dear rosko about two weeks ago i sended you a letter dont you receive it i think you get it shortly rosko you are so manly ive got your pictures and your voice on my taperecording my friends are very jealous but pasternak wont be meeting monika the letterwriter at a personal appearance he wont be taking dedications from her or any other listeners emperor rosko does reign but only in europe monika lives in poland and hears him over radio luxembourg other fans listen on the bbcs radio 1 or on swiss romande pasternak produces the programs some of them weekly some of them specials in thousand oaks and mails the tapes overseas many of his contacts were made during stints as a dj in england and france successful stints that have failed to translate into a major radio career in los angeles pasternak 46 spent nearly two years in 196667 as a disc jockey on the original pirate station radio caroline a ship that broadcast off the coast of england the station had no government licenses and paid no taxes and spawned a number of imitators from 1969 to 1975 he hosted world service countdown a bbc program styled after american top 40 the british edition of billboard magazine named him top european dj of 1976 i could tell a thousand stories about the pirate radio days he said it was both very exciting and very boring because wed do two weeks on the ship and one week off sometimes there was absolutely nothing to do so wed say on the air if you support radio caroline drive to the cliffs tonight and turn on your headlamps theyd do it and it was a tremendous thing to see pasternak was introduced to europe at an early age the son of movie producer joe pasternak where the boys are the great caruso he was born and educated in los angeles but also attended boarding schools in switzerland and paris he said his years overseas have helped him understand his audiences tastes at various times emperor rosko has recrowned himself kaiser rosko or le president rosko he gives listeners a mix of us and european music celebrity interviews and entertainment news delivered in a zany manic style a typical set might include some beatles tunes more recent oldies by such people as bronski beat and new music an interview with cyndi lauper and a contest in which listeners identify songs from snippets i read everything from the times to the national enquirer to get my material although 80 of it is from the enquirer end of the scale pasternak said i sell the image of palm springs and malibu as far as theyre concerned im at the beach to foster that impression emperor rosko mixes the sound of sea gulls and surf into some of his broadcasts rather than a thousand oaks address he uses a post office box on sunset boulevard in hollywood and he does not let facts hinder the creativity of his reporting two days before a jury convicted zsa zsa gabor of slapping a beverly hills policeman emperor rosko reported the guilty verdict on a tape mailed to europe i just knew she couldnt get away with it so i went with my instincts pasternak said radio luxembourg with its highpowered transmitter broadcasts emperor rosko to 27 countries pasternak has gotten mail from as far away as russia and czechoslovakia it does sound you are really enjoying yourself writes phil davson from switzerland in a recent letter yes its definitely a happening show on luxy probably the only happening show pasternak does the luxy show in english programs for france are done in french he makes liberal use of horns and whistles and often closes with emperor roscoe has enjoyed himself my subjects my padded cell awaits me now pasternak has been exporting programs to europe for 10 years ever since he moved back to california he said he left europe to attempt a us radio career and also to be near his father who has been ill pasternak said the shows take two days a week to produce and he fleshes out his living as a mobile disc jockey he provides music at weddings and other parties and performs at personal appearances by casey kasem casey does the first 15 minutes gets all the attention and i do the rest he said hes one of the best djs around kasem said ive used him many times at dances he puts together sets so that he gets young and old on their feet and keeps them there he mixes both oldies and new songs pasternak fell under radios spell while growing up in the 1950s and 60s he borrowed his onair moniker from a black los angeles disc jockey bill mercer who called himself rosko he also admired johnny hayes wolfman jack and in san francisco bob mitchell and tom donaghue the wolfman influence is evident as emperor roskos voice often takes on a raspy sound i did a show with wolf on the bbc pasternak recalled i take him off pretty good so we had a contest to see if anyone could tell us apart they couldnt pasternak is divorced and has no children he said radio occupies the central place in his life it was always my love he said i could have been an actor my dad was a producer but i loved the music i loved rapping along with the rhythm of the songs he also enjoyed the interplay with audiences taking calls and dedications to be able to have that kind of fun with people is the ultimate trip he said but with an ocean and a continent separating emperor rosko and his subjects the immediacy is lost la is the toughest town in the world for a dj he said everybody comes here maybe to make it you have to be able to sell yourself better than i can sometimes i wish i could stick a transmitter on the roof of my house and just broadcast from here
