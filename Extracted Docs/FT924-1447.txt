Chancellor Kohl yesterday proposed sending 1,500 German troops to Somalia , including 'self-defence ' units , engineers and communications teams , writes Quentin Peel . His initiative was condemned by the opposition Social Democrats ( SPD ) as provocative , and contrary to the German constitution , because it would send armed soldiers potentially into action outside the Nato area . Mr Kohl 's move aimed to bring to a head debate in Germany over whether to join only peace-keeping operations , as the SPD prefers , or peace-making efforts too , as the chancellor proposes .
