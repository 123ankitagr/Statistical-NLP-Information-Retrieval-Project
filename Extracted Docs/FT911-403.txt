MR JOHN Garamendi , the rec-ently-appointed Californian insurance commissioner , yesterday issued a 'cease and desist ' order against First Capital Life Insurance Company , a San Diego-based insurer whose parent company is 28 per cent-owned by Shearson Lehman Brothers . The order prohibits First Capital from making payments to its parent company , First Capital Holdings , or to its affiliates without the Commissioner 's permission , and from writing new business . It also places a moratorium on surrenders by First Capital policyholders and on life insurance policy loans . Announcing the order , Mr Garamendi said First Capital was in a 'hazardous' financial condition . Concern about the company 's position had triggered a wave of surrenders in recent days , thus compounding its problems , he said . First Capital is not large - its assets are Dollars 4.5bn and it has 190,000 policyholders - but the authorities ' intervention comes at a sensitive time . Last month , a much bigger Californian insurer , First Executive , was seized by the regulators after concerns about its heavy junk bond portfolio prompted a similar wave of surrenders and a collapse of its marketing network . Like First Executive , much of First Capital problems stem from sizeable junk bond exposure . The Commissioner has been putting pressure on Shearson to help shore up the insurer , but no deal has emerged . Shearson Lehman last night said it will take a Dollars 144m second quarter pre-tax charge related to its investment in First Capital , Dow Jones reports from New York .
