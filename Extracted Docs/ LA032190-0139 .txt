Officers of First Executive Corp. have declined to appear voluntarily before an Assembly committee investigating the life insurance company 's extensive junk bond investments , officials said Tuesday . Patrick Johnston ( D-Stockton ) , chairman of the Assembly Finance and Insurance Committee , seeks legislation to protect policyholders against the insolvency of their life insurance company . Los Angeles-based First Executive in January announced a $ 515-million writeoff against fourth-quarter profit to reflect the lower value of its junk bond portfolio . Last month , Johnston subpoenaed Fred Carr , First Executive 's chief executive , and Doug Marcian , its chief investment officer , regarding their use of a strategy of junk bond investments engineered by Michael Milken . In a letter , First Executive President Alan Snyder told Johnston that Carr and Marcian would not testify because of the time needed for preparation and `` the adverse publicity that would be generated by a hearing in which the central focus is the company 's standing in the insurance community .
