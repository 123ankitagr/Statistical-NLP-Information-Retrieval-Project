sir corporate lawyer ronnie fox writes that the starting point for calculating a payment for termination of employment of an executive is my emphasis the amount that the executive would have earned during the unexpired notice period letters june 28 although i agree broadly with the rest of the letter as a fellow corporate lawyer i believe the starting point should be what the executive would have been entitled by contract under his service agreement including any provisions for mitigation although earnings for the unexpired notice period may form an important element in the final amount mr fox is right to point out the unfairness of mitigation in the case of a senior executive in his 50s but where such an executive is able to move quickly to a new job on comparable terms there is no reason why his compensation should be not be mitigated if that is what the service agreement provides the agreement is what the parties negotiated at the outset and where senior executives are concerned they will have had a reasonable say in the terms the agreement should foresee a broad range of possibilities and provide a reference point for both employee and employer to assess the likely result of early termination michael d varcoecocks 5 brackenbury road london w6 0be
