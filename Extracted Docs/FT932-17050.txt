Watch out for Alan Sugar , chairman and founder of Amstrad . Having upset his loyal shareholders and former friends by his attempt to buy back his company at a knock-down price , he seems intent on refurbishing his public image . Since the failure to take Amstrad private , the consumer electronics entrepreneur has been devoting a large chunk of his time and undoubted marketing skills to a charity fundraising campaign . In less than six weeks Sugar helped round up another 21 mostly blue-chip corporate founder members who , together with Amstrad , have contributed more than Pounds 1m to fund the Excalibur Scholarship Scheme for its first three years . It will provide private sector scholarships at universities in Britain for second degree students from central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union . Perhaps the fates have been watching . Even though his buy-back bid failed , the value of his 35 per cent stake in Amstrad has risen by almost Pounds 20m as the company 's stock has climbed back above the 30p a share Sugar was offering .
