With production of a long awaited second car - the Peugeot 306 - now up and running alongside the 405 range at Peugeot Talbot 's Ryton plant near Coventry , chief executive Geoffrey Whalen is making time for another hack at a broader coalface . In June the bespectacled , donnish Whalen ( right ) , 57 , is to take over from T & N chairman Colin Hope the honorary role of president of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders . It will be the second stint in the presidency for Whalen who , in 1990/91 , had to combine his SMMT role with steering Peugeot Talbot as gently as possible into what has turned out to be the UK car market 's worst recession since the Second World War . This time he is returning to the president 's office in Forbes House , the SMMT 's elegant HQ in Belgravia , with the market at last showing signs of upturn . For all the returning optimism , many reckon that the SMMT president 's role remains mostly an unenviable one . The SMMT speaks on behalf of importers as well as manufacturers , so the potential for internecine strife is considerable . A current slanging match between market leader Ford and Nissan over 'Britishness ' is just one example . But Whalen has a career background which makes him a particularly adept pourer of oil on turbulent waters , as well as a deft diplomatist on behalf of his industry . He has spent much of his working life in personnel and industrial relations , starting with the National Coal Board , before progressing , via General Motors ' AC Delco components subsidiary , to British Leyland . His succession of posts at British Leyland culminated in personnel director of Leyland Cars , as 1970s shopfloor anarchy was reaching its height . In comparison with that , any SMMT squabble would be small beer .
