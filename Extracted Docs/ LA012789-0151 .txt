Another dead sea lion washed ashore in Huntington Beach on Thursday , and a federal official said the new body brings to 12 the number of the dead sea lions found in the coastal city since Saturday . The cause of deaths still is a mystery , said Joe Cordaro , a wildlife biologist with the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service office in Los Angeles . `` Of the 12 sea lion bodies that have been found so far , only two are suspected of having bullet wounds , '' Cordaro said . `` And we ca n't prove that those two deaths were because of bullet wounds . It 's very hard to distinguish bullet wounds from bird bites in dead sea lions . '' Fishermen discovered the latest dead sea lion on the beach near Golden West Avenue and Pacific Coast Highway about 11:30 a.m. Thursday , said Judi Jones , operations director of Friends of the Sea Lion Marine Mammal Center in Laguna Beach . Jones believes that many of the sea lions have been killed by people in boats . `` There are too many deaths occurring in too short a time and all at the same place for this to be a coincidence , '' she said . Cordaro , however , said it is possible that a sea lion disease is responsible for the deaths . He said a 1984 outbreak of a liver-kidney disease affecting sea lions killed hundreds of the mammals in California . He said only 21 dead sea lions were found in all of Orange County in 1988 , compared to 12 found in less than a week this year in Huntington Beach . Of the 21 dead sea lions in 1988 , six apparently were shot to death , six died of illnesses , and nine died of unknown causes , Cordaro said . The string of sea lion deaths in Huntington Beach was first reported to the National Marine Fisheries Service on Jan 19 . Cordaro said an initial tally showed seven deaths , but that subsequent record checks turned up a total of 11 sea lion deaths since Saturday -- all in the Huntington Beach area . The new sea lion body found Thursday raises the total to 12 , he said .
