nearly six out of 10 uk executives would be better off after next april by handing back their company cars in exchange for extra pay and a mileage allowance to run their own cars according to what is claimed to be the largest survey of the uk company cars sector almost one third would gain by more than pounds 750 a year according to employee benefits specialist stoy benefit consulting the london-based group received detailed responses from 5,400 companies operating a combined total of 189,000 cars in reaching its conclusions the study compiled over many months was commissioned by volkswagen audi in an attempt to determine the detailed impact of a new inland revenue taxation regime for company cars which comes into effect next april it assumes an executive receives an extra payment equivalent to what it costs the company to run the car the cost to the company would remain the same the new revenue regime will tax the private benefit to employees of company cars according to simple sliding scales based on new cars list prices it will replace a long-standing but complex price and engine capacity banding taxation system however stoy benefit's managing director mr brian friedman made clear yesterday that the study was not recommending a mass exodus by executives from company cars the other 43 per cent would benefit from retaining their company cars nearly one quarter of these also by pounds 750 a year or more while the company car may not be universally as tax effective as it once was there are still many for whom it remains so according to mr friedman the government's policy towards the taxing of company cars may therefore be said to have been effective in producing the much more balanced position revealed by the survey the survey was aimed wholly at executives paying tax at the higher rate on cars which traditionally if often inaccurately have been regarded as perks they account for around one tenth of all company cars there is no simple formula for individuals to calculate whether they will be better or worse off by giving up their company car which category they will fit depends on individuals annual business mileage individual taxation position and other factors in general those most likely to benefit from handing back their company cars are currently driving executive cars priced at close to the current pounds 19,250 price threshold for higher taxation driving around the boardroom table from stoy benefit consulting 8 baker street london w1m 1 da pounds 95
