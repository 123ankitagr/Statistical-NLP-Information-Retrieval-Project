Avid Bundesbank watchers will be keeping a close eye on this week 's meeting of the German central bank 's council - at which the money supply target for 1995 will be set - to see what clues emerge about monetary policy . The Bundesbank has made no interest rate changes since May and economists are divided as to when rates will start heading upwards again . This year , M3 has soared alarmingly before recently falling back to within striking distance of the target range of 4 per cent to 6 per cent . The 1995 target is expected to be about the same . For the moment , the Bundesbank is keeping the markets calm , knowing how volatile they have been as bond market rates have risen in the wake of US anti-inflationary moves . Next year is likely to be a lot calmer for the bond market than 1994 has been . The 10-year bund yield started the year at 5.55 per cent , its lowest since 1986 , and reached a high of 7.8 per cent in October , from which it has eased slightly . Commerzbank expects the 1995 level to average 6.8 per cent , with a similar level for 1996 . The favourable inflation trend and the easing in M3 provide a stable basis for the bond market , the bank argues , with domestic investors expected to become more enthusiastic .
