Oil still fouls one-third of the beaches hit by last year 's Exxon Valdez spill , according to reports Wednesday by the oil company and federal officials . Oil was found on 358.3 miles of shoreline during a survey of 1,062 miles of beaches struck by oil last year in Prince William Sound , the Kenai Peninsula and Kodiak Island , Exxon said in a progress report to federal and state cleanup coordinators . Most of the shores are lightly oiled . An assessment by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration supported the Exxon analysis even though the numbers differed slightly , apparently because Exxon was faster than the government in processing data sent in by beach survey crews , said Burl Wescott of the NOAA . Alaska spill coordinator Randy Bayliss said the state had no dispute with the findings of how much oil remained .
