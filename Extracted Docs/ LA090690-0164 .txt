A 19-year-old nursing student pleaded not guilty Wednesday to charges of first-degree murder and attempted murder in a shooting that left a teacher dead and and two others wounded at the West Covina vocational school she attended , officials said . Lisa Villela , who originally was charged with being an accessory to the Aug. 16 attack , was scheduled to return Sept. 27 for a preliminary hearing at Citrus Municipal Court in West Covina . The Duarte woman , who is pregnant with her third child , is accused of driving the getaway car for her boyfriend and the suspected triggerman , Martin Meza . Meza , a Mexican citizen , is being tried on murder charges in Mexicali , where he and Villela were arrested after the shooting .
