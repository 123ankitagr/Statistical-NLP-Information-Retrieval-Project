following the small interest rate cuts from the bundesbank last thursday a quarterpoint off both the lombard and the discount rates taking them to 65 and 55 per cent respectively the bund market will this week focus on the march money supply figures as mr adolf rosenstock of the industrial bank of japan in frankfurt put it the chance to cut the whole interest rate salami will depend on the development of broad money growth in the months ahead if the m3 number for march due to be published later in the week turns out at less than 15 per cent it is likely to be encouraging for the listless german government securities market only if the indicator of longterm performance does calm down again that is if m3 does not indicate a preponderant risk of resurgent inflation after 1995 in conjunction with a strong economic recovery will the bundesbank find scope for lowering rates more rosenstock argues the green light will only be given when the trend growth in m3 is back to around 7 per cent he says this would compare with the 4 to 6 per cent target for the year which was exceeded so dramatically in january and february when m3 grew at 212 and 176 per cent respectively on an annualised seasonallyadjusted basis
