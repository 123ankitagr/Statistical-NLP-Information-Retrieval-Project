Unipalm Group , the Cambridge-based computer communications company which was placed on the main market in March , yesterday reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 272,000 for the 12 months to April 30 , exceeding the flotation forecast . The outcome , which compared with profits of Pounds 605,000 last time , came on turnover ahead to Pounds 10.8m ( Pounds 8.39m ) . As well as its Unipalm interconnection software distribution activities , the company has high hopes for Pipex , a specialist in attaching commercial customers to the Internet - a self-regulating global computer network . The distribution side reported profits of Pounds 716,000 pre-tax , partially offset by losses of Pounds 444,000 at Pipex , reflecting substantial investment in 'people , equipment and infrastructure ' according to the company . Mr Peter Dawe , managing director , said , however , that Pipex had had ' a remarkable year ' . Turnover jumped from Pounds 381,000 to Pounds 1.43m . It had achieved a growth rate of 10 per cent a month with record orders in June . Public interest continued to grow , he said , with more than 250 organisations now using Internet through Pipex . 'We 've shown that we 've put the foundations in . Now we 're building the upper storeys , ' he said . Earnings per share emerged at 0.89p , down from 2.9p , but again beating the company 's own estimate at flotation .
