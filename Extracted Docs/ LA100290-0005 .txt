Once again we 're inured with Jessie Jackson 's dogmatic love of rhetoric ( `` Why Then Embrace De Klerk ? '' Commentary , Sept. 27 ) . By propping up Iraq President Saddam Hussein and trying to make a feeble comparison between two very different circumstances , Jackson shows his very selective racial preferences , i.e. , anyone who is not white . Jackson states : `` The world acknowledges that South Africa is a racist state . '' Jackson 's mind is a `` racist state , '' and I challenge him to show me one nation free of racism . Jackson thinks we should `` talk it out '' with Hussein . If Jackson were held at gunpoint by a thief , would he talk it out ? He informs us that ( South Africa President Frederik ) `` De Klerk 's security police are now implicated in the current violence among black South Africans . '' No , Jesse . Black tribes fight among each other like Crips and Bloods -- yet I trust you will continue to believe that all black peoples ' sufferings are caused by whites . A die-hard liberal . I always thought that a black U.S. President would show our love of liberty and equality . But honestly , I have black friends who are more qualified for the office than this habitual demagogue .
