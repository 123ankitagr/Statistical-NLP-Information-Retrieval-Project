Question : There have been a lot of negative comments about advertising , but one of the positive things about it is that it has encouraged my children to ask for specific foods that I believe are good for them . For example , they will ask for a certain brand of cereaL that I suppose is healthy . Is n't that positive ? Answer : I would much rather have children learn about the factors that make a food nutritious , rather than have them learn a brand name . The most popular brand of cereal , which may be the brand most heavily advertised , is not necessarily the most nutritious . Moreover , while some children may learn about cereals through advertising , others may become as familiar with the brand names of candy , cookies , and potato chips . I do n't think we can rely on advertising to educate our children about nutrition ; the primary responsibility is still the parents ' .
