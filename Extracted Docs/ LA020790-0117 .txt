question there have been a lot of negative comments about advertising but one of the positive things about it is that it has encouraged my children to ask for specific foods that i believe are good for them for example they will ask for a certain brand of cereal that i suppose is healthy isnt that positive answer i would much rather have children learn about the factors that make a food nutritious rather than have them learn a brand name the most popular brand of cereal which may be the brand most heavily advertised is not necessarily the most nutritious moreover while some children may learn about cereals through advertising others may become as familiar with the brand names of candy cookies and potato chips i dont think we can rely on advertising to educate our children about nutrition the primary responsibility is still the parents
