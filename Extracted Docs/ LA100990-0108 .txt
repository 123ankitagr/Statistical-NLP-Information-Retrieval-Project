The University of Miami on Monday received an invitation to become the 10th member of the Big East Conference , and the school 's board of trustees will decide Wednesday whether to accept the offer . Big East officials have been courting the independent school for several months , and had reportedly been awaiting a signal that Miami would accept an invitation before extending one . But Miami Athletic Director Sam Jankovich and President Edward Foote declined to predict how the 55-member board would vote . If the invitation is accepted , the role of Miami 's football program in the Big East would be decided later . Boston College , Pittsburgh and Syracuse are the only Big East schools that play major college football , and all are independents in that sport . The other schools in the league are Georgetown , Connecticut , Providence , St. John 's , Seton Hall and Villanova .
