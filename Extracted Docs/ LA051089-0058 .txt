As way to show that the mayor 's office is serious about fighting drug abuse , political appointees on Mayor Maureen O'Connor 's staff have been asked to join a voluntary drug-testing program in which the mayor will also participate , her office announced Tuesday . O'Connor will submit to a drug test when she returns from a European vacation in about two weeks , said Paul Downey , the mayor 's spokesman . Most of the other 28 eligible employees took the urine test last week and results are expected shortly , Downey said . Downey said the samples will be tested for the presence of cocaine , marijuana , amphetamines and several other illicit drugs . He said he did not know if the test would include alcohol . Results of the tests will not be made public and only Ben Dillingham , the mayor 's chief of staff , and the employee will be told the result , Downey said . Dillingham also will be in charge of any possible disciplinary action should someone test positive , Downey said . Downey said no action will be taken against anyone who declined to participate in the program . Downey said the program was based on a belief by the mayor that `` public officials should be held to some higher standard '' and was not the result of a concern that a drug problem existed on the staff . Downey , who said he submitted to a drug test last week , said the staff and mayor felt that the program would `` set an example to the community that this mayor and her staff are serious about the problem of drug abuse . '' But Downey added that the mayor and her staff were not advocating that other city departments start similar testing programs . The city already has a policy that allows supervisors to order urine tests of city workers who are suspected of using illicit drugs . That policy , however , does not apply to workers on the mayor 's staff .
