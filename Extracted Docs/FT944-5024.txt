Do n't employ unqualified people to give advice on rating matters following the latest uniform business rate revaluation to be announced early next year . So says the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation , which represents public- and private-sector staff involved in local taxation . If the institute is to be believed , the UK is full of 'bogus rating consultants ' . The institute 's advice is to wait . Lists of valuations will be published by the Valuation Office Agency early in 1995 showing new rateable values that will come in next April . In the meantime , Business Rates : Your Guide is available for Pounds 5.99 from the Institute of Revenues Rating and Valuation . Tel 071 831 3505 .
