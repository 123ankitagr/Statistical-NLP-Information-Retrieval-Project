the prospect of an early reduction in germany's official interest rates receded further yesterday with news that money supply growth continued to exceed the bundesbank's target range by a wide margin in february the central bank said m3 the broad monetary aggregate expanded at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 8.5 per cent last month compared with the average in the fourth quarter of 1991 this was a slight decline on the 9 per cent rate in january but economists said m3 expansion was still too high to allow any scope for relaxing monetary controls the target range is growth of between 3.5 and 5.5 per cent this year the bundesbank lifted interest rates by half a point in december to leave the discount rate at 8 per cent and the lombard rate at 9.75 per cent chancellor helmut kohl is understood to have backed the bundesbank's tough monetary line when he attended its council meeting last thursday the bundesbank said the main force propelling m3 was the volume of bank lending to companies and individuals though this had weakened slightly long-term lending remained strong while short-term lending eased in the past six months it has risen at an annual seasonally adjusted rate of 11.5 per cent
