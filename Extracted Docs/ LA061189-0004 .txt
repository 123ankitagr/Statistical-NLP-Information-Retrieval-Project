its tacky tacky tacky for nbc to show the preempted episodes of miami vice after the seriesending episode on may 21 this is like the dodgers playing rainedout games after the world series like george bush giving campaign speeches after the election like the winds of war showing the last episode before the middle episodes its very thoughtless of nbc to show miami vice out of sequence and its not very nice miami vice used to be a big hit for nbc and its a shame the network is letting the show go out in a schlocky fashion linda cowan mose sherman oaks
