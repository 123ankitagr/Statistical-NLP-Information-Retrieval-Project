It 's tacky , tacky , tacky for NBC to show the preempted episodes of `` Miami Vice '' after the series-ending episode on May 21 . This is like the Dodgers playing rained-out games after the World Series ! Like George Bush giving campaign speeches after the election ! Like `` The Winds of War '' showing the last episode before the middle episodes ! It 's very thoughtless of NBC to show `` Miami Vice '' out of sequence . And it 's not very nice . `` Miami Vice '' used to be a big hit for NBC and it 's a shame the network is letting the show go out in a schlocky fashion . Linda Cowan Mose , Sherman Oaks
