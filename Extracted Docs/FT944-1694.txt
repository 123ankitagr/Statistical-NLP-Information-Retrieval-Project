the us was trying yesterday to secure the return of a captured army pilot and the body of his co-pilot after their helicopter was shot down in north korea the incident prompted us calls for a suspension of aid programmes it came at an awkward time for both countries following their recent agreement to halt pyongyang's nuclear programme in exchange for the opening of diplomatic ties and economic aid president bill clinton said in a statement released by the white house that the helicopter had strayed into north korean airspace on saturday he declared that the tragic loss of life was unnecessary and that we are using all available channels to press for an early resolution of this matter the situation is potentially embarrassing to the us because the helicopter appeared to violate the truce agreement that ended the 1950-53 korean war aircraft from either side are not supposed to fly near the demilitarised zone between north and south korea let alone cross it mr william perry us defence secretary said the helicopter which was on a training mission had strayed into north korea because of a navigational error north korea claimed that it then shot down the helicopter republican senator pete domenici incoming budget committee chairman said yesterday that unless north korea co-operated over the incident the us should not hand over funds promised for building safer nuclear reactors democratic senator daniel patrick moynihan was asked if the helicopter issue should prompt the us to delay implementation of the nuclear deal that is exactly what the north koreans should be asking he replied they are not exactly in an enviable position are they their dictator the late president kim il sung is dead their economy is dead analysts believe that north korea may try to use the incident for propaganda purposes and to extract new concessions from the us but north korea is unlikely to try to use returning the pilot as a bargaining chip as this would give conservative us critics of the recent nuclear accord extra reasons for opposing it north korean officials have recently expressed concern that the new republican-controlled congress may try to block the nuclear pact which critics believe offers too many concessions to pyongyang the us has called for a meeting of the military armistice commission which supervises the truce to discuss the situation but north korea may refuse to attend it withdrew from the commission earlier this year in an attempt to pressure the us to sign a peace treaty to end the korean war formally north korea may use the current visit to pyongyang of mr bill richardson a democratic representative from new mexico to arrange the pilot's release mr richardson yesterday held talks with senior north korean officials on the helicopter incident
