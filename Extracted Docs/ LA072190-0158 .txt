it event ranks louisiana purchase battle vicksburg development atomic bomb at least according life magazine 1975 listed invention air conditioning among 100 events shaped america introduced 1902 way control humidity brooklyn printing plant air conditioning brainchild willis carrier cornell university graduate went refine invention compact practical device capable cooling everything movie theaters passenger trains air conditioning changed america forever it tamed hottest climates making possible economic population booms south southwest sped growth host new industries dependent precise climate control hospitals skyscrapers shopping malls would unthinkable without perhaps nowhere however air conditioning made personal impact upon american life home in 15 years since life published list american milestones residential air conditioning gone luxury item expected part daily life in orange county air conditioning home took residential building boom 1970s industry sources estimate 75 homes equipped form refrigerated cooling device and yet large numbers homeowners air conditioning remains something mystery misunderstood misused isnt taken granted time air conditioning whether central system selfcontained window unit basically refrigerator turned extrovert it uses components compressor condenser evaporator fan working fluid cool air much larger scale a basic physical laws work namely working fluid usually chlorofluorocarbon freon compressed gets hotter release pressure evaporates gas gets cooler at time hot freon liquid releases heat surroundings cool freon gas absorbs in air conditioner cool gaseous freon passes coils evaporator inside house absorbs heat warm interior air it passes transfer lines compressorcondenser outside here gas compressed hot 200 degrees fahrenheit liquid pumped condenser coils the liquid much hotter outside air releases heat surroundings passing back evaporator as pressure released liquid freon turns cool gas ready begin another cycle heat absorption release put simply air conditioner like man bailing boat except case boat house water heat bucket freon many people believe air conditioner somehow makes cold air scientifically however thing cold varying degrees less heat the cool breeze coming fan air conditioner air lost something 20 degrees heat as far comfort goes important air conditioner remove moisture air cool air this moisture removal possible colder air becomes less water hold as indoor air reaches saturation point cooling process moisture contains collects fins inside air conditioner drains away think glass ice water sweats warm air cools contact gives moisture an air conditioner works much way the failure understand process dehumidification lead homeowner choose wrong air conditioner most people think bigger better says mike karsten coowner benchmark air systems inc anaheim but oversize system cools rapidly airborne moisture little chance condense collection fins people i run across residential sales think choosing air conditioning like buying race car if 200 horsepower good 400 horsepower great that isnt case air conditioning too much cooling fast get cold damp air karsten says most new homeowners dont worry picking right air conditioner builders up mid1970s residential air conditioning optional karsten says builders didnt prepare homes way often homeowners buy install systems during optional period last 20 years air conditioning proved popular tens thousands units installed these systems distributors installers manufacturers anticipating surge residential sales tired units replaced new efficient models ralph luciano sales representative trane large manufacturer air conditioners says units today nearly twice efficient mid1970s energy conservation big today says fifteen years ago air conditioners probably ran energy efficiency rating five six today average nine 1992 federal law mandates level least 10 eer acronym moment airconditioning circles basically measure amount heat unit remove per watthour electricity consumed its cousin seer seasonal energy efficiency rating used estimate cost running air conditioner average cooling season federal law requires every airconditioning unit carry ratings expressed btus british thermal units a btu measure cooling capacity for example 12000 btus equal one ton refrigeration capacity capacity needed melt 2000 pounds ice 24hour period a typical central airconditioning system twobedroom house may equal three 3 12 tons cooling capacity 36000 42000 btus central air conditioners eers 16 gaining popularity residential customers want get cooling bang energy buck according luciano to help spur move save electricity southern california edison offers rebates highefficiency residential airconditioning equipment edison spokesman kevin kelley says customers also get billing discounts enroll cycling program automatically shut selected residential air conditioners radio remote control peak demand times these shutdowns last one hour six hours kelley says they take place 15 days year usually afternoons never weekends most people join arent even home times shutdowns might occur customers join program rewarded automatic credits six months electric bills regardless whether shutdowns take place the introduction split systems use one air conditioner cool several areas house also helped cut operating costs homeowners making possible shut one units area use in addition multithermostats control cooling room room timers turn systems according predetermined hoped energy efficient schedule for homeowners planning replace old central airconditioning units care must taken chances unit dates back much 1980 piping contains asbestos the epa estimates 300000 homes orange county asbestos piping says tony grupensperger karstens partner benchmark as long isnt smashed damaged ok but homeowner starts tearing apart handling improperly hell major problems major money worse once piping contains asbestos damaged must removed replaced and licensed asbestos remover job most distributors installers cant touch grupensperger says its law punishable imprisonment includes homeowner tries fool indoor air quality growing concern homeowners especially family member suffers serious allergies dust lint smoke pollen bacteria circulate airconditioning systems traveling parts house unless intercepted filter throwaway fiber filters remove large airborne particles dust advanced expensive electrostatic electronic filters needed trap various microscopic debris may include animal dander fungi even dead skin according air conditioning refrigeration institute the acri also points dirty filter isnt much good anything except cutting air flow system it recommended filters replaced cleaned least month steady use keeping cool installing central air typical twobedroom home run $ 3000 $ 4000 according grupensperger and homes without existing duct work sheet metal labor costs add another $ 500 $ 1000 total for want beat heat budget economyclass alternative central cooling room air conditioner although still noisy despite many manufacturers claims contrary new models surprisingly effective cooling smaller areas prices range $ 300 $ 500 machines load capacities 5000 7000 btus adequately cool dehumidify areas size medium bedroom installation room units usually doityourself job although need help positioning units heavy 50 90 pounds awkward people living upper floors need ensure installation secure two years ago air conditioner slipped seventhfloor window new york city plunged sidewalk killing pedestrian of far global concern errant air conditioner dropping sky use chlorofluorocarbons escape pose threat ozone layer researchers experimenting various approaches air conditioning old new would eliminate need cfcs one promising device based old technology cools air blowing water mist time managing neat trick removing humidity it accomplishes adding desiccant lithium bromide water dry air
