thomas spiegel a maverick who built columbia savings loan into one of the nation's most controversial thrifts by using federally insured deposits to buy high-risk junk bonds announced monday that he will resign dec 31 as head of the beverly hills institution the resignation of spiegel 43, who will remain a columbia consultant comes at a tumultuous time for the thrift after years of posting big profits from its junk bonds and other high-yield investments it is now showing huge losses as the value of its 3.8 billion portfolio tumbles in recent months junk bonds have fallen sharply in price as investors have grown nervous about their safety sparked in part by problems at some companies that issued them and fears of a recession in addition new federal thrift rules enacted to rein in non-traditional thrift investments require columbia to sell its bonds by 1994, and devalue those bonds on its books to reflect the depressed values they are selling for lately junk bonds are financial instruments issued by companies with low credit ratings they pay holders a higher yield above 12 in recent years to compensate for the added risk as of nov 30, columbia's unrealized losses on its high-yield investments largely the difference between what columbia paid for the junk bonds and what investors are willing to pay for them on the open market was a staggering 744 million according to columbia executives about 100 million of that amount came in november alone the executives said columbia so far has set aside about 300 million as a cushion against those losses in the third quarter ended sept 30, columbia posted a 226.3 million loss its stock has plunged from nearly 12 a share this spring to close at 2.75 on monday in a statement spiegel cited the rapid deterioration of the junk-bond market as prompting his resignation as chairman chief executive president and a director he also cited the publicity surrounding me an indirect reference to the attention given his business and personal ties to indicted financier michael r milken columbia and spiegel's father abraham who founded the thrift also have been publicly linked to the investigation of mayor tom bradley's financial dealings milken the former drexel burnham lambert junk-bond executive is awaiting trial in federal court in new york on securities fraud and racketeering charges spiegel who with his family owns more than half of columbia's stock built a profitable thrift largely by using funds gathered by wall street money brokers people who invest money in savings and loan accounts that offer high yields he offered attractive rates to those money brokers then locked in a profit by buying lucrative junk bonds from milken's clients that paid a higher yield than he was paying out for deposits spiegel in the announcement said he plans to work with investment bankers at first boston corp to form an entity for the junk bonds most likely columbia's junk bonds would be spun off somehow to a separate company trust or partnership and columbia would continue to reap some profits from the bonds by holding a stake in the firm and providing loans to it acquaintances of spiegel said they are not surprised that he would want to head a junk bond operation and even leave the chief executive's job since he clearly is more interested in investing than he is in running a traditional thrift but without access to those federally insured deposits and with milken's future clouded they said it would be more difficult for him to work his magic as he did at columbia those familiar with columbia said that spiegel probably will run the operation it most likely will attract money from institutional investors such as pension funds and insurance companies by issuing securities backed by the junk bonds spiegel acquaintances said the timing of his leaving is curious because no successor has been found columbia named kenneth r heitz columbia's principal lawyer to fill in for him adding that candidates are being screened by an executive search firm thrift industry executives who know spiegel speculated that he may be leaving in anticipation of an embarrassing disclosure possibly related to the milken case columbia investments and trades have been under investigation by federal prosecutors and columbia records have been subpoenaed heitz said however that neither columbia nor spiegel has received a so-called target letter one sent by prosecutors when an indictment is imminent he added that prosecutors have told him that neither spiegel nor the thrift will be named in an expanded indictment expected soon in the milken case columbia although not thomas spiegel personally has been linked to bradley in the ongoing investigation into the mayor's finances spiegel's father abraham is a longtime personal friend traveling companion and political contributor to bradley who has advised the mayor on his investments also an embarrassing loan and junk-bond investment made to former rep tony coelho d-merced through thomas spiegel also helped prompt coelho's resignation earlier this year columbia's biggest problems are maintaining adequate capital the financial cushion against losses in the wake of its deteriorating junk bond values and finding a replacement for spiegel quickly in its announcement monday however columbia confirmed that it failed to meet one of three new capital standards that took effect effect thursday the standard it flunked is called a risk-based measurement a measure computed by weighing the riskiness of a thrift's investments as a result columbia will have to file a plan with regulators within a month showing how it will come into compliance with standards columbia said regulators had no influence over spiegel's decision to resign and that it was voluntary until recently columbia has been among the best capitalized thrifts in the nation one of its advertising campaigns touted it as the best managed major thrift in the country based on ratings published in forbes magazine as previously reported columbia also is involved in an accounting dispute with federal regulators from the office of thrift supervision over whether it can count money set aside for unspecificed losses on its junk bond investments as capital heitz said that despite its problems with the junk bond market columbia will be able to meet the new capital standards after its restructuring is finished he noted that the thrift has sold nearly all of its 3.5 billion portfolio of mortgage-backed securities packages of mortgages that investors buy for a gain of nearly 90 million and sold public and private stock for another gain of 75 million junk bond advocate columbia s l chief spiegel was not a traditional thrift executive d1
