Regarding bills and amendments to fireproof the flag : What rubbish -- all of it ! The flag symbolizes love of country . The love felt by the individual . Burning , blasphemy , and desecration ca n't touch it . Symbols and words are used to represent what people see as underlying realities that may or may not exist but , nevertheless , exist apart from the symbols and words . What did stoning do to remedy blasphemy or the Inquisition against heresy ? Obscenity ? The flag flying over a Ku Klux Klan meeting is what obscenity 's all about . DEAN J. SLOCUM Costa Mesa
