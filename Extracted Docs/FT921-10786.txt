GPG , the investment company run by Sir Ron Brierley , the New Zealand entrepreneur , will be sending its 1991 report and accounts to its UK and New Zealand shareholders three weeks later than the New Zealand Stock Exchange had stipulated . NZSE regulations required completion by January 31 and the London Stock Exchange by March 31 . The company had intended to meet the earlier date but the preparation of the accounts on the basis of the new UK Financial Reporting Exposure Draft 1 , as yet unadopted by the UK Accounting Standards Review Board , has taken longer than expected . The NZSE was informed of the likely delay on January 22 and a waiver was sought . It was denied .
