The City Council has approved 5.5 % salary increases for the coming year for city management employees . The 5.5 % raise is to be followed in 1992 and 1993 by increases based on the Consumer Price Index , under a three-year agreement reached between the city and management group employees and approved by the council Monday . About 75 employees are covered , including the directors of community development , human services and transportation departments , senior accountants and the city engineer , said Personnel Manager Gordon Youngs . The raise is retroactive to Oct. 8 . Last year , management employees were given a 4.5 % pay raise . Certain upper-level management employees classified in a separate personnel category , such as Youngs , the city attorney , deputy city attorneys , the chief administrative officer and the city clerk , were given 5.5 % pay increases . With the raise , Youngs earns $ 6,203 a month , Chief Administrative Officer Dale Jones , $ 8,925 , City Atty . Eleanor Egan , $ 8,491 , and Community Development Director Jody Hall-Esser , $ 6,819 , Youngs said . City Clerk Pauline C. Dolce and Treasurer Sue McCabe each earn $ 5,843 monthly . Deputy city attorneys make $ 5,315 per month . The vote for the pay raises was 3 to 2 , with Councilman James D. Boulgarides and Mayor Steven Gourley saying they opposed the increases because of the city 's tight budget . Gourley said the raises may lead to layoffs in the spring . However , Gourley voted for the increases for the city clerk and treasurer , saying that elected officials ' salaries lag behind their capabilities and qualifications .
