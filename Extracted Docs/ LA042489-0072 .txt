Following are capsule reviews of today 's screenings in the American Film Institute Los Angeles International Film Festival at the Cineplex Odeon Century Plaza Cinemas : 'Venus Trap ' West Germany , 1988 , 107 minutes 6:50 p.m . The latest film by West German sex-and-society phantasmagorist Robert Van Ackeren ( `` A Woman in Flames '' ) is weird indeed : like a fancy porno film in which all the sex has been removed , jumping from one tease to the next . We wander in and out of the fantasies of an ever-ready young doctor smirking and consummating his prodigious lusts all around the city . Its theme is the rebirth of romance in the teeth of desperation , or sex-as-calculated-rebellion , but Van Ackeren may have over-calculated , this time . How much teasing we can take ?
