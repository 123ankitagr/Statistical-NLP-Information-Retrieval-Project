when mayor tom bradley kicked off the los angeles festival in san pedro earlier this month he stood behind a podium draped with the name of occidental petroleum corp a sponsor of the event since it was launched in 1984 the oil companys chairman armand hammer also was on hand to speak less visible to the public however has been the role of one group of executives whose support was considered crucial to this latest festival the japanese business community for the first time 42 japanese companies from aisin usa to yamaha motor corp contributed a total of $ 1 million or about 20 of the budget for the twoweek series of performances and art exhibits focusing on the pacific rim the festival ends sunday maureen a kindel chairwoman of the festival said the decision by japanese business leaders to provide an infusion of money that was not normally available to us came when fundraising prospects otherwise seemed bleak without that commitment there would be no festival kindel said in an interview what was a bonanza to the festival was also an important development in japanese philanthropy one that is being eyed by cashpoor nonprofit groups ranging from public television stations to fledgling theater companies by championing an event that is both multicultural and nontraditional the japanese executives were not only helping to promote their own country but also signaling a new interest in building bridges to other ethnic communities almost unknown until five years ago japanese corporate giving to the arts education and philanthropic causes has been increasing rapidly fueled by deep worries about american hostility over the trade imbalance and such highprofile investments as sonys acquisition of columbia pictures until very recently japanese contributions to the arts and education were largely restricted to major upscale institutions such as the music center efforts to help americans understand japan touring kabuki theater or bunraku puppet shows and endowed university chairs in science and engineering but now a new focus is slowly being added japanese companies stung by criticism for not hiring enough minorities and women are being told that being a good corporate citizen the phrase of the moment involves understanding the complexity and diversity of american society consequently dollars earned in the united states by japanese companies are starting to trickle in to mural projects communitybased cultural centers such as the one under construction in torrance and enrichment programs at innercity schools nowhere is this emerging trend more obvious than in southern california according to craig smith editor and publisher of the seattlebased newsletter corporate philanthropy report and others whats distinctive about japanese funding here is that its spreading from the elite centers to more communitybased organizations he said were seeing a linkage between the japanese and their ethnic constituencies a country with no tradition of philanthropy japan is now modifying its tax laws in order to stimulate more donations and make tokyo officials more responsive when requests come in from usbased executives both government and industry have dispatched representatives to study american giving practices as further encouragement 100 companies announced last spring they would contribute 1 of their net earnings before taxes to philanthropic causes smith estimates that japanese companies will dole out $ 300 million this year a 30 increase over last year in this country japanese philanthropy is being closely watched even though it is minuscule compared to us corporate giving which last year amounted to $ 56 billion but while japanese contributions are swelling donations from american businesses are expected to grow only by $ 200 million this year not enough to keep pace with inflation with the current challenge to federal funding of the arts and the downturn in the us economy many arts organizations are trying to forge links with potential japanese donors by smiths very rough estimate southern california captures only $ 10 million to $ 20 million of japanese largess but that is because the figures are skewed by the high cost now estimated at $ 2 million each of the chairs the japanese have chosen to endow at top universities such as the massachusetts institute of technology uc berkeley and stanford mit alone has 22 chairs at this point support for communitybased activities involves far more modest amounts for example hitachi ltd whose los angeles representative masayuki kohama is spearheading the drive to broaden japanese philanthropy has contributed $ 20000 to social and public art resources center sparc a multiethnic mural program headed by judith baca $ 1000 for a korean youth center fundraiser and $ 5000 to a scholarship fund named for democratic congressman mervyn m dymally the companys chemical subsidiary gave $ 15000 to the orange county performing arts center for a childrens arts festival with what the centers director thomas r kendrick described as a strong multicultural orientation some of this giving is done in conjunction with the hitachi foundation one of 11 similar philanthropic organizations established in the united states by japanese companies since 1984 this summer the foundation whose stated mission is to pursue crosscultural understanding and strengthen the infrastructure of american society sponsored a tour by the latino theater group el teatro campesino so far however the newly articulated emphasis on grass roots america is most noticeable in the area of education when american honda corp set up its foundation it gave grants to a wide variety of programs from the epilepsy foundation to the jfk performing arts center in washington now the focus has been narrowed to youth and science education one honda program provides scholarships to gifted needy students at walter reed junior high school in north hollywood to be set aside until the teenagers are ready for college the panasonic foundation is providing technical assistance to nine school districts including san diegos which are trying to make fundamental changes in their school systems sophie sa the foundations executive director acknowledges that such help is not costly a total of $ 1 million a year but stresses that the longterm relationship with the school districts will make it easier for the program to have an impact nissan which has been criticized for lagging behind the other companies in corporate philanthropy is stepping up its efforts but has also decided to zero in on education by for example establishing literacy centers at east los angeles schools it safe to say you can expect significant expansion of our corporate philanthropy programs said company spokesman don spetner who blames nissans slow start on the companys failure to perceive ourselves as a part of corporate america like other japanese companies nissan is sensitive about charges that the japanese simply throw money at problems without really getting involved such criticism surfaced last year when the japanese business community gave $ 10 million to victims of the san francisco earthquake other critics like former trw inc analyst pat choate argue that the japanese are trying to expand their political influence in the united states through grassroots giving our philosophy is to have ownership in the program spetner said we get very involved rather than just being a name on a list of contributors despite nissans selfimposed limitations arts organizations are optimistic that many japanese companies will heighten their involvement in the local cultural scene both by giving more money and by playing a more active role in fund raising something only a handful of japanese executives have done so far several have been partial to the music center the 650member japanese business assn raised more than $ 350000 in the past fiscal year with contributions from other japanese companies bringing the total to nearly $ 1 million according to esther wachtell the organizations president she said that figure does not include promotional activities such as the opening of phantom of the opera sponsored by toyotas lexus division and the hollywood bowl jazz series funded by nissans infiniti division by comparison however arco whose headquarters are in downtown los angeles gave the music center $ 200000 during the same period and funded the opera companys $ 250000 production of oklahoma jiro ishizaka chairman of the japaneseowned union bank sits on the music centers board along with consul general kiyohiko arafune and several other japanese executives are also active fundraisers the japanese have been very good friends from the beginning and were proud of that wachtell said last year yukiyasu togo president of toyota motor sales usa and a devotee of classical music let it be known through an intermediary that he was interested in providing the pipe organ for walt disney hall the future home of the los angeles philharmonic unlike most other japanese companies toyota whose american headquarters are in torrance has long had a corporate giving program and in contrast to most other usbased officials who have to be authorized by their tokyo offices to donate more than $ 5000 togo has a free hand no consultation was needed to enable him to write a $ 1million check for the pipe organ according to jeffrey a smith assistant to the president the los angeles county museum of art has not enjoyed quite as strong a relationship with the japanese business community with one notable exception according to development director julie a johnston japanese companies raised $ 4 million both here and in tokyo to aid in the construction of the pavilion for japanese art which opened in 1988 the group effort on behalf of the pavilion led by toshio nagamura former chairman of union bank became a model for fundraising for the la festival for most local arts institutions japanese companies remain a largely untapped resource one that is especially welcome now that other sources of funding may be drying up i doubt whether they can make up the difference but at least they can provide an additional funding source that we havent totally utilized said frederick m nicholas chairman of the museum of contemporary art which received $ 500000 from the shuwa investments corp the japanese real estate giant that owns arco plaza although kcet the public television station has been receiving funding for cultural programming from the private e nakamichi foundation for several years it is only now beginning to loosen japanese corporate purse strings officials said the first project a documentary comparing japanese and american education that will air later this year was funded by matsushita hitachi and the japanese automobile manufacturers assn at a cost of $ 536000 donald g youpa kcet executive vice president said he is optimistic about future funding now that japanese understand how public television in this country works but alex gibney the los angelesbased executive producer of the pacific century a 10part series slated to air on public television in 1992 came away emptyhanded when he sought money from japanese corporations they want to avoid controversy at all costs he said adding however that he did not yet have an american corporate sponsor either also eager for a share of japanese support are local colleges and universities where japanese presence is so far minimal one big exception is uc irvine site of a new $ 165million biotechnology laboratory funded by hitachi chemical even before it opened in april critics raised fears that hitachi would use the lab to steal technological secrets in los angeles only ucla which has enough graduates in japan to make it worthwhile to maintain a tokyo alumni office gets appreciable funding from japanese corporations mostly in small amounts ucla lists two chairs endowed by japanese corporations one in japaneseamerican studies and another in material science other corporate funding is helping to build an international student center despite uscs interest in asia 25 of its faculty members are experts on japan the private university has not had a lot of success in getting japanese corporate money said paul blodgett associate vice president for development he said usc is trying to interest sony in contributing to its film school and is also talking to hitachi toyota and honda building relationships with the japanese takes time according to gordon m berger former head of uscs east asian studies center which has received about $ 160000 in fellowship money from a private japanese organization but little else the japanese want to have a sense of a longterm relationship rather than a onenight stand he said
