Delegates to this year 's International Monetary Fund meeting must be pleased with the 30 per cent rise in the IFC 's emerging market index over the past year . Its advance provides ready enticement to industrial country fund managers anxious to boost their return . Capital flows to the developing world are soaring as a result . But as the fashion for emerging country shares spreads ever wider , nagging worries surface about the risk of overkill . On technical grounds such concern looks premature . Emerging country economies account for some 13 per cent of world GDP , while their stock markets account for only 6 per cent of world market capitalisation . On this basis , their shares look structurally undervalued . Moreover industrial country institutions are relatively under-invested in emerging countries , where markets respond to different factors than those at home . They still have room to boost their return by diversifying into emerging markets without increasing their overall portfolio risk . Indeed the fashion for emerging markets may be driven by their increasing liberalisation . Exclude from the IFC index markets closed to foreigners and its gain is even more impressive . Foreign buying - or the prospect of it - in markets that have liberalised is apparently fuelling gains in share prices . The danger is to assume the progress is linear . No market is immune from shock . Russian troubles could upset eastern Europe ; a rise in US interest rates would hit Asia . Worst of all would be a failure of the Gatt which would both hit developing country growth prospects and undermine the trend towards trade and investment liberalisation .
