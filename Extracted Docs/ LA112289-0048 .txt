Former President Ronald Reagan postponed a visit Tuesday to Loyola Marymount University , where students and others indicated they would protest his appearance . Reagan gave as an official reason his sympathy with the Jesuit community , which is mourning the killing of six priests in El Salvador last week . Several people called the Jesuit-operated university to protest Reagan 's visit , according to David Herbst , a student and chairman of the speakers program . Some blamed Reagan 's policies in El Salvador for contributing to the slayings last Thursday , he said .
