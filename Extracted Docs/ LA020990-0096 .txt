Mayor Michael White is setting aside time next Wednesday for one of the more unusual aspects of his job : Since the Ohio Revised Code allows mayors to perform marriages , White , who has been mayor since the first of the year , said he will exercise that right on Valentine 's Day , and since that is Feb. 14 , White is limiting it to 14 couples . The mayor said he will marry couples at noon or officiate for couples wishing to renew marriage vows .
