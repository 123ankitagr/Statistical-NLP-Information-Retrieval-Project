Christmas . . . a time of goodwill and of good movies . Or so it would seem , as the airwaves are filled with such holiday favorites as `` White Christmas , '' `` Holiday Inn , '' `` A Christmas Carol , '' `` Miracle on 34th Street '' and the ubiquitous `` It 's a Wonderful Life . '' Everyone has a favorite and that includes celebrities . We asked some to name their favorite Yuletide film . Tradition won out with `` It 's a Wonderful Life '' and `` Miracle on 34th Street '' holding a definite edge , but there were some surprises . Ed Asner : It used to be `` It 's a Wonderful Life , '' but I 've reached overkill on that . I would say now it 's any version of `` A Christmas Carol . '' Scott Bakula : I look forward to `` White Christmas '' every year because I think the Irving Berlin music is wonderful and I am a fan of Bing Crosby . John Beard ( KNBC-TV news co-anchor ) : Frank Capra 's `` It 's a Wonderful Life . '' My family watches it together every year and we all cry like babies because it makes us realize how important we are to each other . Linda Bloodworth-Thomason ( creator and co-executive producer of `` Designing Women '' and `` Evening Shade '' ) : I would like to be different from the others , but you ca n't miss with `` It 's a Wonderful Life . '' Tom Capra ( executive producer , `` The Today Show '' ) : `` It 's a Wonderful Life '' because it 's the best Christmas movie of all time and my dad made it . Johnny Carson : `` Miracle on 34th Street '' -- because everyone else will mention `` It 's a Wonderful Life . '' Jackie Collins ( author ) : `` The Godfather '' and `` The Godfather II , '' because it 's the only time I can sit down and watch them both . Paul DeMeo ( co-executive producer of `` The Flash '' ) : `` The Lady in the Lake . '' It 's set during Christmas and has one of my favorite lines when ( detective ) Philip Marlow is questioning a tennis player he says , `` Your tan is very nice , it 's very Christmasy . '' Jerry Dunphy ( KCAL news anchor ) : `` A Christmas Carol , '' because there is a strong moral message that says you better be good because everybody does n't get a second chance to try it again . Hal Fishman ( KTLA news anchor ) : `` Miracle on 34th Street '' because it 's brilliantly directed . It 's a movie in which dreams and expectations and hopes really come true , which is what Christmas is all about . Jackee : `` Die Hard . '' When I saw that towering Christmas tree in the lobby of that big old building in Century City and all of those people drinking champagne I could n't stop laughing . This is Christmas in L.A. James Earl Jones : I inherited an addiction to `` It 's a Wonderful Life '' from my wife . I love it because it has an intricate , complex plot that holds up year after year . Larry King : `` White Christmas , '' and the reason is with Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye , two of my all-time favorite people , plus Irving Berlin music , you ca n't go wrong . Swoosie Kurtz : `` A Tree Grows in Brooklyn . '' It always makes me cry . It is so dear and so wonderful . Piper Laurie : Jean Shepherd 's `` A Christmas Story . '' Unlike most Christmas films , which tend to be syrupy and overly sentimental , this film is sharp , very funny and extremely touching . Jess Marlow ( KNBC news anchor ) : `` Miracle on 34th Street '' is my favorite because it gave me a reason to believe in Santa Claus , and if you 've had the kind of luck I 've had , you have to believe in Santa Claus . George Peppard : `` Five Days From Home '' ( which he stars in and produced ) . It 's about a father giving his son a puppy for Christmas and almost getting killed doing it . John Shea : A television film called `` The Nativity . '' It was my first film . I played Joseph and I am stepfather to God and that is why it 's my favorite . Now I know I will go to heaven . Cybill Shepherd : `` It 's a Wonderful Life '' because it 's a about redemption . I cry during the first eight minutes and cry at least four more times during the film . Connie Stevens : `` A Pocketful of Miracles '' has a great view on life shown through the humorous eyes of great director Frank Capra . Cheery , hopeful , inspirational . Mick Sweda ( lead guitarist of L.A.-based heavy metal band BulletBoys ) : `` Lethal Weapon , '' which I consider a Christmas film since that is the season in which it takes place . Carl Weathers : `` Miracle on 34th Street '' is for the kid in me . The whole idea of dreams coming true and Santa Claus being real . It 's a very endearing movie . Jonathan Winters : The English version of `` A Christmas Carol '' because I like the message behind it . Edward Woodward : `` Mary Poppins , '' and the reason is my daughter Emily has watched it more than 100 times and because her aunt , Karen Dotrice , plays the little girl , Jane . And CBS ' `` A Christmas Carol '' because it features the definitive performance of Ebenezer Scrooge by George C. Scott .
