Apparently , the closeness of the Super Bowl does not have a great effect on television ratings . Sunday 's game , in which San Francisco edged Cincinnati , 20-16 , drew an average overnight Nielsen rating of 42.7 and a share of 65 in the nation 's 17 largest markets , according to NBC . Last year 's Super Bowl , in which Washington routed Denver , 42-10 , drew an overnight rating of 41.2 -- only 3 % lower than this year 's -- and a 60 share . The final national rating will be announced later in the week . In Los Angeles , this year 's Super Bowl rating was a 42.4 and the share a 72 , compared to a 42.8 and a 66 for last year 's game . In San Francisco , the game drew a 53.3 rating and an 82 share . The highest national Super Bowl rating ever , a 49.1 , was for the 49er-Bengal game in 1982 . The San Francisco rating for that game was a 55.7 and the share an incredible 93 , meaning 93 % of the people in San Francisco watching television at the time were watching the Super Bowl . A rating represents the percentage of television households where a particular program is being watched . Last year 's Super Bowl drew a national rating of 41.9 , the lowest since 1974 . LARRY STEWART
