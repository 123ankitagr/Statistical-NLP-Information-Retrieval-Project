there were no fire crackers at yesterdays launch of chinatrust international securities the first taiwanese investment bank to open for business in the city of london but that there was going to be plenty of other razzmatazz was clear even before the official ceremony began dr jeffrey koo chairman of the new banks parent in taipei picked his way from room to room past a myriad of bright paper decorations and extravagant floral displays while a brown and white police spaniel checked the premises for bombs ahead of the arrival of his honoured guest lady thatcher the former uk prime minister it was not a bad show for a group whose total banking assets are still only dollars 18bn but then chinatrust which aims to become a global business with a position in the ranks of the worlds top 100 banks is strikingly long on ambition founded with capital of just dollars 2m in 1966 the parent bank only acquired a taiwanese commercial banking licence two years ago and is already spreading its wings across asia it helps that chinatrust is the flagship financial vehicle of the koo family reckoned to be the second richest family in taiwan whose industrial interests range from cement to petrochemicals hotels and cable television the ebullient dr koo who is a senior adviser to taiwans prime minister and says he met lady thatcher over dinner when she visited taipei obviously knows how to cultivate connections these will doubtless be put to good use in the uk the new investment bank aims to help taiwanese companies raise capital abroad through the issue of convertible bonds to channel portfolio investment into the taiwanese market as well as to manage taiwanese investments in europe it is a daunting task because unlike the foreign securities companies which are now established in taipei chinatrust lacks securities distribution capacity in europe but dr koo says distribution will always be a problem for new entrants to the market london is a good place to start because about 30 to 40 per cent of foreign investment in taiwanese equities originates in the city chinatrust believes it can sell its services on the basis of the quality of its research we can offer good advice to uk investors he says the limit on foreign investment in the taiwanese market set presently at dollars 75bn should not be a problem there is room for another dollars 2bn in investments and the limit will be increased when the ceiling is reached he says confidently it is simply that the pace has to be controlled when japan started to liberalise it took them 10 years we are doing it at a very fast pace perhaps however chinatrust will make its main initial mark in the bond market dr koo believes the interest of taiwanese companies in issuing convertible eurobonds is large and growing while the taiwanese government controls the countrys dollars 90bn in foreign reserves it is relatively hard for private sector companies to raise foreign currency from domestic banks the risk is that taiwanese companies will set out on an issuing spree similar to that undertaken by japanese companies in the 1980s as they latched on to the low cost of borrowing in this way the market became saturated with paper which eventually proved a poor investment as the stock market slid yet dr koo believes there is a difference whereas taiwanese companies tend to raise funds for specific projects many japanese issuers were simply following the herd when the bubble economy burst they still had to bear the cost no matter how cheap the money the taiwanese will never do that they are more pragmatic they will never raise funds just to feel comfortable
