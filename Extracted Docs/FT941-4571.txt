rogers communications faces a long wait for canadian regulatory approval of its cdollars 3 bn usdollars 2.2 bn strategic merger with maclean hunter both the federal radio-television and telecommunications commission crtc and the bureau of competition must review the deal as rogers is canada's biggest cable-tv operator and maclean hunter the second largest maclean hunter also holds extensive print media interests federal industry minister mr john manley said it is by no means clear the takeover creates unacceptable media concentration and some argue that canada needs the critical mass to compete with the giant us multimedia conglomerates mr phil lind vice-chairman of rogers said he did not expect the crtc decision until early 1995, and a trustee would technically run the merged business until then rogers cannot complete the sale of any parts of maclean hunter such as the publishing and commercial printing units until the crtc makes its decision in the past the crtc decisions have leaned towards preventing any single company from dominating the domestic cable industry the competition bureau's position will depend heavily on the crtc decision rogers won the maclean hunter board's approval of its cdollars 17.50 a-share cash offer for all the maclean hunter shares it does not already own it also got an option on 17.4 m maclean hunter treasury shares at the same price the expiry date was extended to march 31 from march 15 to allow time for the us federal communications commission to rule on rogers proposal to sell maclean hunter's us cable licences for about cdollars 1.5 bn this was designed to reduce rogers heavy debt load the enlarged rogers would have 33 per cent of the total canadian cable subscriber base up from 23.5 per cent before the deal the big us cable operator telecommunications has 10 m subscribers
