An Oxnard helicopter pilot was forced to land on the Pacific Coast Highway north of Ventura on Tuesday after a fuel system problem caused his chopper 's engine to begin sputtering , a California Highway Patrol spokesman said . Neither Giacoma Valenti nor the unidentified passenger in his Hiller helicopter were injured in the 2:40 p.m. emergency landing near Emma Wood State Beach , Officer Jim Utter said . Valenti had taken off from Santa Paula for a brief flight up the coast when the engine problem occurred . Utter said Valenti brought the craft down on the northbound lane of the highway , causing traffic delays for about an hour while a mechanic made preliminary repairs . The pilot then taxied the helicopter to a nearby clearing , where the repairs were completed , and flew the craft home an hour later , police said . CHRISTOPHER PUMMER
