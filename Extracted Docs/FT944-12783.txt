And no one wants to see the 30,000 strong Lebanese army , nor indeed the remaining 30,000 or so Syrian troops , idle . Sheikh Naim Kassem , a founder of Hizbollah , which still has an estimated 3,500 fighters dotted around Lebanon , as well as MPs , ominously says : 'The price of peace will be greater than that of war . ' Another Beiruti suggests : 'The Syrians are still here to protect Hizbollah , who would otherwise be wiped out by the Lebanese army . ' Meanwhile , Hizbollah contents itself by trading shots with Israel in the south . A lasting peace ? Do n't count any chickens .
