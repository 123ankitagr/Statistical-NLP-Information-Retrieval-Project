The repaired space shuttle Columbia inched past its grounded sistership Atlantis and was returned to the launching pad Thursday for liftoff around Sept. 1 on a critical flight to end NASA 's long summer that saw no shuttle launchings . In an unprecedented shuttle shuffle , Atlantis , crippled by a fuel leak , was rolled off launching pad 39A late Wednesday to make way for Columbia . The two vessels passed each other shortly before dawn Thursday , with Columbia completing its 3.5-mile trip to the seaside firing stand around noon . If all goes well , Columbia , carrying five astronauts , two civilian astronomers and a cargo of telescopes , will blast off around Sept. 1 on a 10-day astronomy mission that was grounded on May 30 by a hydrogen leak . The ship has since been repaired . If the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 's revised launching schedule holds up , only seven shuttle missions at most -- possibly as few as six -- will be launched this year . The space agency originally hoped to launch as many as 10 flights in 1990 . One flight was lost because of problems readying the shuttle Discovery for launching earlier this year to carry the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in April , and fuel leaks with Columbia and Atlantis have prevented any flights since then .
