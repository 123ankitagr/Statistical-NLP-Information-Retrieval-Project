PEUGEOT TALBOT , the UK subsidiary of the French car group , is to follow Ford and Vauxhall in establishing a national 'fast-fit ' replacement parts and service chain . Peugeot Talbot aims to help dealers recapture business worth more than Pounds 1bn a year which has been progressively lost to aggressive independents such as Mr Tom Farmer 's Kwik-Fit Euro and Halfords . A small number of Peugeot Talbot 's 405 dealers are starting a pilot programme for the chain , called Xpress Fit . Results will be assessed next year and the network is expected to be extended over the following three years . Mr Charles Greenland , Peugeot Talbot 's director of parts and service , said that the network is expected initially to be made up of about 50 outlets , concentrated in urban centres . Xpress Fit centres will aim primarily to provide parts and service for the 1.1m Peugeot models on UK roads . Ford and Vauxhall - whose operations are called Rapid Fit and Master Fit respectively - conceived them as 'all makes ' operations but have also decided to concentrate on their own brands . Ford has calculated that the 'fast-fit ' business for the 6m Fords up to 10 years old on UK roads is worth about Pounds 400m annually . Although Vauxhall was first into the field three years ago , Ford 's operation seems to be enjoying most success , with 187 of its nearly 1,000 dealers operating or preparing Rapid Fit outlets .
