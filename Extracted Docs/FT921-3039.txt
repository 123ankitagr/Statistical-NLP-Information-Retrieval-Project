texas instruments ti the us semiconductor company has signed cross-licensing agreements with two japanese companies that recognise ti's claim to have invented the integrated circuit a fundamental device in all modern electronic equipment the agreements with sharp and ricoh represent an important step for ti towards protecting hundreds of millions of dollars in patent rights in japan they are particularly significant because they are the first such agreements since a decision last summer by fujitsu the japanese computer company to dispute ti's claim in the japanese courts it had been feared that other companies would hesitate to recognise the texas instruments patent until its dispute with fujitsu had been resolved texas instruments said yesterday however that it was continuing to negotiate licensing agreements with at least ten other electronics companies including mitsubishi electric and that the negotiations appear to have been unaffected by the fujitsu dispute seven japanese companies have now accepted the texas instruments patent claim including toshiba oki electric matsushita and nec texas instruments first applied for a japanese patent for the integrated circuit in 1960, but struggled until 1989 before the kilby patent named after a co-inventor of the integrated circuit mr jack kilby was accepted by the japan patent office texas instruments claims the patent covers fundamental technology that applies to all integrated circuits while fujitsu claims its own semiconductor devices do not use texas instruments technology fujitsu last july sought a court determination that the texas instruments patent does not apply to fujitsu products seven court hearings have been held to date and final resolution is expected to take at least another year texas instruments hopes that recognition of its patent by other japanese companies will support its case
