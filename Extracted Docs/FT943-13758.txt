the bundesbanks policymaking council meets on thursday the last time before the german central banks summer recess as is traditional the meeting is the occasion for the bundesbanks midyear review of the development of m3 money supply this year is especially important in view of ballooning growth in m3 since late 1993 a dilemma for the bundesbank has been how to justify cutting interest rates while tolerating monetary growth at more than double the 4 to 6 per cent target range the bundesbank is likely to modify the target range on thursday but there is little consensus among economists about how this may be achieved traders will be less interested in the technicalities than concrete signs that the bundesbank will be able to resume interest rate cuts in the autumn without further damage to its credibility in this context a good figure for june m3 likely to be released on thursday would provide evidence that money growth is subsiding anything under 12 per cent would be considered good as it would mean a decline from mays 134 per cent annualised seasonally adjusted rate there is a chance that the bundesbank will cut the discount rate on thursday but this is highly unlikely
