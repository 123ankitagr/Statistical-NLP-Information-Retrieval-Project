Scripps Clinic & Research Foundation did its third liver transplant overnight Tuesday , on a 49-year-old San Diego man . The six-hour surgery on the man , who declined to be identified , began about 6 p.m. Tuesday , a Scripps spokeswoman said . He needed a new liver because of a condition called primary sclerosing cholangitis , a hardening and inflammation of the bile ducts . Meanwhile , a Whittier woman who underwent a liver transplant at Scripps last Friday was upgraded earlier this week to serious but stable condition . Those two transplants followed the July death of the first person to undergo the operation in Scripps ' new program .
