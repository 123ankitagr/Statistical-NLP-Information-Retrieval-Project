at 54 vern gosdin appears to have hit his stride this year two of his singles set em up joe and will you believe me now went to the top of the country chart while chiselled in stone the album that spawned them received a country music assn nomination as album of the year gosdin himself was nominated as best male vocalist though he has been acclaimed for years by such fellow musicians as emmylou harris and merle haggard mass acceptance is something new gosdins only previous visit to the charts high side was a brief one 5 years ago when the tiny compleat records released his i can tell by the way you dance youre gon na love me tonight its so funny the way things happen gosdin who has been making music since the 50s said with a laugh from his home outside nashville three years ago right when country music looked like it was going to leave the country i wouldve never thought id be able to get a deal because a lot of labels including cbs his current record company didnt seem to be looking for real country artists gosdin who will be opening for george jones at the celebrity theatre in anaheim saturday night is as country as country gets he started singing on the gosdin family gospel show on wvok radio in birmingham ala from there he moved to atlanta when things failed to gel he moved to chicago and ran a country nightclub he began honing his bluegrass licks and in 1960 moved to california where he joined his brother rex in a group called the golden state boys knocking around california gosdin met all sorts of people including a rather serious young bluegrass player named chris hillman together they formed the hillmen and worked bluegrass festivals around the state until hillman joined the byrds and helped start the folkrock revolution the byrds eventually used one of gosdins songs for the easy rider sound track vern though had no interest in pop he had grown up listening to the grand ole opry on saturday nights so thats where his heart lay he signed with capitol records nothing happened he moved back to atlanta opened a glass business and sang a little on the side independent record deals came and went but none could offer the mass distribution and exposure needed to get to the charts upper reaches if youre gon na do me wrong do it right threatened to break but didnt gosdin got back to gospel with an album called if jesus comes tomorrow what then and eventually bob montgomery entered the picture montgomery a producer who had helped the okanes get a record deal was considered a champion of honest country music though wed met several times wed never worked with each other gosdin recalls but we clicked right off the result was chiselled in stone whats funny is this is one of the lowestbudget records ive ever done he says i think because we had the right producer and the pickers we got into the studio and knew exactly what we were doing we all got together in there played and had one fun time soon after the album was released gosdin got a phone call from an old pal george jones called to tell me he really loved the record ive known george a long time and i cant begin to tell you how good that felt because one thing about jones to get him excited it just about takes an act of congress gosdin himself continues to lead a quiet life with his wife on their 40 acres and he talks of wanting to do another gospel record when the time is right
