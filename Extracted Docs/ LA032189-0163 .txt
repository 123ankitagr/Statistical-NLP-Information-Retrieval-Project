John Olerud has returned to classes at Washington State University after undergoing an operation two weeks ago to repair an aneurysm near the base of his brain . The standout baseball player has resumed light workouts to rebuild his strength but is not expected to rejoin the baseball team in the near future . `` The main thing is John is back in school and everything is going to be all right , '' WSU baseball coach Bobo Brayton said . `` Baseball is going to be around for quite some time , and we 're just happy that John is going to be here too . '' Olerud , a junior pitcher and first baseman who was named college baseball Player of the Year in 1988 by Baseball America magazine , is `` feeling great , '' according to his father , Dr. John Olerud . But the elder Olerud , a professor at the University of Washington Medical School , said it 's still not been determined yet whether his son will be able to play for the Cougars later this season .
