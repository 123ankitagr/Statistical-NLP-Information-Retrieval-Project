British Petroleum yesterday ended a long-running tax dispute with the state of Alaska by agreeing to pay Dollars 1.4bn ( Pounds 850m ) in back taxes . The settlement ended a dispute which had clouded relations between BP and Alaska , one of its most important operating locations . BP 's fields on Alaska 's North Slope account for about 40 per cent of the company's worldwide output . The dispute centred on oil and gas production taxes paid by the company between 1979-91 and its 1978-88 state income taxes . It arose over different interpretations of wellhead prices and the cost of transporting oil . The state contended that BP and other companies operating in Alaska , such as Arco and Exxon , understated wellhead prices and overestimated transportation costs , thus lowering their tax liability . Mr Walter Hickel , Alaska 's governor , said the agreement represented an 'equitable resolution of all significant tax disputes between the company and the state . ' It is thought that Alaska 's original claim against the company was as high as Dollars 3bn . BP declined to comment on how much tax relief it might qualify for , but US analysts said it should receive substantial federal tax relief on the Dollars 1.4bn settlement . That could cut BP 's net payout by more than half , to around Dollars 630m . Company officials said adequate financial provisions had already been made . They predicted that the settlement would not affect BP 's profits . The settlement calls for BP to pay Alaska in three instalments . A payment of Dollars 700m is due at the end of December . Two further payments of Dollars 350m each are due at the end of 1995 and 1996 . The company said other terms were confidential . It had obtained a limited waiver to announce that a settlement had been reached .
