mr clark clifford the former us defence secretary indicted last week on criminal charges relating to the bank of credit and commerce international bcci scandal has won his request for the trial to be held unusually soon alan friedman writes from new york a washington judge has set october 26 as the date of the trial of mr clifford and mr robert altman his protege and law partner the two men were indicted in washington and new york last week the washington charges allege that they misled federal banking regulators about their knowledge of bcci's secret ownership of first american bankshares a washington bank they ran during the 1980 s messrs clifford and altman have entered pleas of not guilty in response to these charges the setting of an early washington trial date is something of a tactical victory for the two accused lawyers for both men argued for a quick trial date claiming that mr clifford 85, might not live long and wished to clear his name by winning a verdict in his favour but legal experts speculate there may be another advantage in being tried on the washington charges before having to face the indictments brought in new york the washington charges are far less serious than those in new york these include conspiracy the taking of bribes falsifying business records and scheming to commit fraud under new york state law it is considered possible that double jeopardy provisions might mean a favourable verdict in washington could preclude a new york trial another complication arising out of mr clifford's winning of an october trial in washington is that it might result in a delay of the separate and unrelated trial of mr caspar weinberger the former reagan administration defence secretary indicted recently in the iran contra scandal this could be because mr clifford and mr weinberger both have the same lawyer who might find it difficult to prepare simultaneously for the equally complex iran contra and bcci trials
