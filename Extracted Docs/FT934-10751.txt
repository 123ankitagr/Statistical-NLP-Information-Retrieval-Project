north korea said yesterday it would boycott a key meeting today with south korea setting back hopes for a resolution of its dispute over nuclear inspections north korea's cancellation of the talks came as senior us and south korean defence officials met in seoul to consider whether to suspend their joint team spirit military exercise scheduled for next spring pyongyang has demanded that team spirit be cancelled before allowing the resumption of routine nuclear inspections by the international atomic energy agency iaea but the us is unlikely to cancel team spirit as long as north korea fails to achieve progress in talks with south korea about additional mutual nuclear inspections us and south korean officials had hoped that today's inter-korean meeting would break an impasse with the two countries agreeing to exchange presidential envoys who would discuss nuclear inspections and other bilateral issues us and south korean officials believe that the north korean nuclear inspection issue may now be reaching a critical stage mr hans blix the iaea director-general told the un earlier this week that agency's ability to monitor activity at north korea's nuclear facilities is in danger of being broken if pyongyang continues to deny access to iaea inspectors mr les aspin the us defence secretary and mr han sung-joo the south korean foreign minister agreed yesterday in seoul that whenever the iaea declares the safeguards to be broken they would stop negotiating with north korea and ask the un security council to impose economic sanctions on pyongyang the most important variable right now is blix's judgment on when the safeguards are broken seoul and washington believe this judgment is entirely up to the iaea said a south korean foreign ministry official north korea has warned that it would take appropriate counter-measures' if it is threatened with sanctions implying a military response pyongyang's refusal to meet seoul appears to be in reaction to the un general assembly's overwhelming approval of a resolution on monday urging north korea to co-operate immediately with iaea inspections
