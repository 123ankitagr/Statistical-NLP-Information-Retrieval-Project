Sir , The publicity given to the financial problems of Sears Roebuck ( January 26 ) reminds me of the story of the US midwest farmer who wrote to the company for the price of its toilet rolls . It wrote back referring him to page 447 of its mail order catalogue , whereupon the farmer replied saying that if he had its catalogue , he would n't need the toilet rolls .
