south korea yesterday indicated it may pursue a more conciliatory policy toward north korea reversing its recent tough approach to pyongyang the government of president kim young-sam has been criticised for its north korean policy which is leaving seoul increasingly isolated as washington and pyongyang conduct negotiations on possible diplomatic ties us diplomats will make an unprecedented visit to the north korean capital today to begin talks on setting up liaison offices between the two countries as part of a deal under which pyongyang would accept full nuclear inspections the two sides will also meet in berlin where mr william perry the us defence secretary said he was prepared to offer north korea substantial incentives in return for pyongyang dismantling its nuclear weapons capacity the softening of seoul's stance on the north is believed to result from talks held in washington earlier this week between mr han sung-joo the south korean foreign minister and mr warren christopher us secretary of state the us agreed that progress in us-north korean relations would have to be linked to an improvement in inter-korean dialogue but it is believed that washington asked south korea to improve the atmosphere for a resumption of talks between seoul and pyongyang in a sign of compromise during the washington talks south korea agreed to accept liaison offices between the us and north korea according to a senior adviser to the foreign ministry the seoul government has conducted an inconsistent policy over the north korean nuclear issue since it erupted 18 months ago alternating conciliatory gestures with tough statements this reflected deep divisions in the government over the appropriate response to solving the north korean problem following the death of north korean president kim il-sung in early july president kim young-sam adopted a hardline stance toward the north he predicted that north korea was close to collapse and indicated that a planned summit between the two koreas would not be held as it would give a stamp of legitimacy to pyongyang's new leadership under mr kim jong-il the late president's son he also ordered a crackdown on leftist students who expressed sympathy for north korea amid allegations that radicals had infiltrated the political establishment and media analysts said the tough policy was meant to reverse a recent drop in mr kim's popularity and bolster his support among conservatives including the 7 m south koreans who once lived in the north before escaping after the communist government took power in 1945 but the south korean media have spoken of a crisis in diplomacy in recent weeks
