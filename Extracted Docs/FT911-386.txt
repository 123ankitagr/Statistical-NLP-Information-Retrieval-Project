I NEED some information in writing from my tax inspector who seems unable or unwilling to answer my questions ie . does not reply to my letters . Is there a superior being to whom I can write to ask that I be sent the information I require . As a first step , write to the District Inspector at your tax office - marking both the letter and the envelope : 'For the attention of the District Inspector ' . Whether you can insist upon being given the information depends upon what it is that you want . Statement of Practice F1 ( Limitations on Revenue advice to taxpayers ) stresses that 'the primary duty of the Revenue towards the taxpayer . . . is to assess his liability after the end of the year ' . No legal responsibility can be accepted by the Financial Times for the answers given in these columns . All inquiries will be answered by post as soon as possible .
