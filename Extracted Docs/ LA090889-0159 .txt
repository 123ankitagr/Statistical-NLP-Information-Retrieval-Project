A handwritten letter by Marilyn Monroe was sold for $ 7,150 , setting a record for an auction price for a letter by a movie star , according to a specialist in autograph auctions . The auction Thursday night broke the old record of $ 6,600 paid in September , 1987 , for a handwritten letter by actress Greta Garbo , said Herman Darvick , who stages autograph auctions six times a year . The record does not include one movie actor -- the one who became President . A handwritten letter by Ronald Reagan praising Frank Sinatra once sold for $ 12,500 , but his White House connection made a large difference , Darvick said . The Monroe letter , in an envelope postmarked Jan. 17 , 1945 , is actually signed Norma Jeane , Monroe 's given name . She was 18 when she wrote it .
