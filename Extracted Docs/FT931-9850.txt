CANARY WHARF and other developments in London 's Docklands were still destined to become a 'symbol of prosperity ' , a defiant Mr John Redwood , minister for local government and inner cities , told the Commons last night . But his optimism was ridiculed by Mr Doug Henderson , shadow local government minister , who said Canary Wharf had become 'the lost city of Wapping ' . Mr Redwood urged his critics to 'wait to see what happens yet ' . He insisted that Canary Wharf - which Mr Henderson said was 85 per cent empty - was already a famous name .
