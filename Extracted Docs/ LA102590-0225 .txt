in the decade since rent control was imposed in santa monica no one has ever been elected or appointed to the citys rent control board who was not associated with the powerful tenant political group santa monicans for renters rights and although there is some question whether tenants will back an smrrsupported ballot measure or a competing one sponsored by landlords there seems little doubt that the tradition of an allsmrr rent board will continue after the nov 6 city election there may be some confusion out there among tenants about the ballot measures but i believe they realize that smrr is still their best bet to protect affordable housing and tenants interests on the board said jay johnson an smrr member who was appointed to the board earlier this year and is now seeking election to a full fouryear term the challengers to smrrs slate of four candidates acknowledge that they face an uphill battle in stopping the tenants groups winning streak people have told me i cant win without the smrr endorsement but ill give it my best shot said barbara miller a tenant who is running an independent campaign after failing to receive the organizations endorsement because of a resignation last year four of the five seats on the board are up for election six candidates are competing for the three full fouryear terms a separate election to fill the last two years of an unexpired term has drawn two candidates for the fullterm seats smrr has endorsed incumbent johnson an apparel sales representative suzanne abrescia a child development specialist and lisa monk borrino a tenant attorney landlord ed simonian a chemical engineering firm manager and two tenants law school student robert madok and miller a certified shorthand reporter are the other candidates the candidates for the twoyear term are robert niemann a substitute math teacher who has been endorsed by smrr and james l jacobson a property management consultant who ran unsuccessfully for the board in 1984 the four candidates with the smrr endorsement are running coordinated campaigns rent board commissioner dolores press is serving as campaign chairwoman for all four and david borrino a santa monica deputy city attorney and husband of lisa monk borrino is their campaign treasurer simonian madok and jacobson have formed a loose alliance to challenge the smrr slate miller is running independently rather than personalities the campaign up to now has focused on the candidates support or opposition to two ballot measures proposition u backed by landlords and proposition w which smrr supports proposition u would remove the provision of santa monicas rent control laws that rankles landlords the most the section that maintains rent control even when a tenant vacates an apartment voluntarily if proposition u is adopted landlords would be able to raise rents to whatever level the market will bear when voluntary vacancies occur proposition w a competing measure placed on the ballot by the city council at smrrs request would allow rents on voluntarily vacated apartments to rise to specific higher levels based on the number of bedrooms the rents allowed by proposition w would be significantly higher than what is now permitted in many cases but still well below freemarket levels predictably all four candidates on the smrr slate oppose proposition u and support proposition w simonian madok and jacobson all favor proposition u and oppose proposition w independent candidate miller opposes both measures saying that proposition u would bring about the end of rent control in the city and that proposition w doesnt provide adequate protection from landlord harassment in the campaign for the ballot measures both sides have been using scare tactics tenant advocates say that if proposition u passes it will mean the end of affordable housing in santa monica and landlords predict that if it doesnt pass more landlords will go out of business under the state ellis act the ellis act adopted in 1986 allows landlords to legally evict tenants and go out of business provided they give adequate notice and pay relocation fees owners of more than 1100 units have notified city officials of their intent to evict tenants two of the candidates one from each slate have had personal experience with the ellis act abrescia was evicted from her apartment under ellis three years ago and madok is now under the threat of an ellis eviction madok said his situation is evidence that landlords need relief provided by proposition u while abrescia said her experience reinforced her belief that tenants still need the protection of rent control the smrr candidates say they would bring with them a new spirit of cooperation with landlords but at least one opposing candidate is skeptical they would be a duplicate of the existing board said simonian following are brief backgrounds on each of the candidates in the same order as on the ballot jay p johnson 47 was appointed to the rent board to replace julie lopez dad in march as a compromise candidate after a split board could not agree on several other candidates johnson is a landlord but has been active in smrr including sitting as a member of smrrs steering committee he said he believes there needs to be better integration and coordination between the rent board city council planning commission and the office of community and economic development over housing issues we have to protect the rental housing stock he said according to the financial statement he filed with the city clerk johnson has raised $ 1210 for his campaign including a $ 300 personal loan and spent only $ 257 however he and the three other smrr candidates enjoy the benefits of more than $ 160000 raised by the group for slate literature and phone banks ed simonian 51 owns two buildings with a total of nine units only his sixunit building is under rent control simonian says he supports rent control but says the law should be applied in a more balanced way toward landlords he supports proposition u but says that he and other smallscale landlords will be slow to benefit from it because the turnover rate is extremely low for rentcontrolled apartments nonetheless he says the passage of the measure will have a psychological effect of giving landlords hope he said disputes should be handled through mediation to avoid clogging up the courts and that landlords and tenants should be allowed to negotiate rent increase and passthrough costs simonian raised $ 1275 and had not spent any of it as of sept 30 suzanne abrescia 40 has been involved in tenant organizing for several years and formed a support group three years for tenants like herself who were evicted under the ellis act i feel there is a need for rent control as long as there are abuses in rent control she said abrescia considered a run for the board in 1988 but decided not to after other candidates whose views she shared entered the race she is part of a group of slowgrowth advocates within smrr a group that has become increasingly outspoken in recent months amid mounting criticism of some prodevelopment votes cast by smrr members on the city council abrescia has raised $ 908 and spent $ 351 according to her campaign statement but most of her campaign is being waged as part of the smrr slate lisa monk borrino 35 says she has defended more than 200 evictions in santa monica west hollywood and los angeles as a tenant attorney for five years borrino said that without rent control monthly rents would rise to the levels found in marina del rey where rent control was removed five years ago she said she would work to improve the relationship between the board and landlords i think landlords have to be treated with respect she said i dont have a themversusus attitude borrino part of the smrr slate has raised $ 1340 and spent just $ 32 for her individual campaign barbara miller 46 said she decided to run for the rent board after fighting off two eviction attempts by her landlord i want to help prevent others from undergoing the constant stress and pressure these proceedings cause she said she opposes any changes to the current rent control law and is alone among the candidates in opposing both propositions u and w miller who is endorsed by current board member wayne bauer says the board needs an independent candidate such as herself who doesnt owe anything to anyone else miller filed a statement saying she did not intend to raise or spend more than $ 1000 during the campaign robert madok 26 is a law student at usc who has lived in santa monica for less than three years he said he favors proposition u over proposition w because it would protect current tenants from rent increases while offering landlords enough of an incentive to stay in business he says the board must also be more consistent in dealing with rent increases and decreases based on his dealings with other tenants in his building he says he believes most tenants are willing to pay a little more in rent to keep their apartments madok filed a statement saying he did not intend to raise or spend more than $ 1000 robert niemann 50 is a halfowner of a fourunit apartment building in santa monica he was involved in bringing rent control to santa monica in 1979 even though he was living in venice at the time as part of the smrr slate niemann supports establishing a fund to subsidize rent increases for lowincome tenants niemann also advocates a better relationship with landlords maybe by being less confrontational landlords will come to the conclusion that apartments are still a good investment if they stay in it for the long haul he said niemann raised $ 1390 and spent $ 204 james l jacobson 38 is a tenant but works for landlords dealing with the rent board jacobson says his eight years of dealing with the board and rent control regulations make him the most qualified candidate for the job and would allow him to bring a sense of history to the board he says landlords particularly the small owners need relief and need to be treated fairly and with respect by the rent board if they are to stay in business i have come to the conclusion that if the law was fairly applied it would not be a system that apartment owners would love but it would be one they could live with he said jacobson is promoting a 10point proposal including rent adjustments based upon percentages rather than set dollar amounts jacobson reported raising $ 2280 and spending $ 446
