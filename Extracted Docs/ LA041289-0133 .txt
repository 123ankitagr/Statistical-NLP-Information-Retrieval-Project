Three dead sea lions washed ashore at Sunset Beach this morning , and a federal official said they probably had been trapped in fishing nets at sea . The sea lion carcasses were discovered between 10th and 11th streets at Pacific Coast Highway . `` The sea lions probably died after being trapped in gill nets '' of commercial fishermen , said Joe Cardaro , a wildlife biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service in Los Angeles . `` About 99 % of the sea lion deaths in January and February were because of fishing nets . '' In those months , the National Marine Fisheries Service counted about 50 dead sea lions in the area of Seal Beach , Sunset Beach and Huntington Beach .
