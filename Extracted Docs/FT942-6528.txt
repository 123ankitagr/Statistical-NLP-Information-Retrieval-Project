Spain faces the prospect of a two-week series of strikes in its public transport system . There has already been a strike by railway workers , during the rush hour last Wednesday , and a subway strike in Madrid and Barcelona on Thursday . The rail strikes are in protest at wide-ranging plans to restructure Spanish railway services . Renfe , the national rail company , is due to be split into separate operating companies with the loss of 14,500 jobs .
