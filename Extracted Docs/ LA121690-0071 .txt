The story , `` CBS Expects Its First Loss in Decades '' ( Nov. 20 ) , overlooks a factor contributing to the network 's baseball-related financial woes : It has clearly demonstrated only a half-hearted commitment to the sport , thereby discouraging regular viewers . During the season , CBS sporadically aired only a handful of games . After shelling out more than $ 1 billion for the right to broadcast baseball , one would think that the network would aggressively pursue a steady audience -- or , at the very least , formulate a set broadcast schedule . Further evidence that the network is not serious about building baseball viewership is its decision to air one of the playoff games on a Monday afternoon rather than pursue prime-time competition with `` Monday Night Football . '' Thanks to CBS , baseball fans have now learned that the `` hidden ball trick '' is not just for infielders . The first year of the contract between CBS and Major League Baseball has been a fiasco for the network , the fans and the game . As a lifelong baseball fan , I hope that in the next round of negotiations for the broadcast rights to baseball , Major League Baseball will consider factors about its suitors other than the size of their bids .
