the story cbs expects its first loss in decades nov 20 overlooks a factor contributing to the networks baseballrelated financial woes it has clearly demonstrated only a halfhearted commitment to the sport thereby discouraging regular viewers during the season cbs sporadically aired only a handful of games after shelling out more than $ 1 billion for the right to broadcast baseball one would think that the network would aggressively pursue a steady audience or at the very least formulate a set broadcast schedule further evidence that the network is not serious about building baseball viewership is its decision to air one of the playoff games on a monday afternoon rather than pursue primetime competition with monday night football thanks to cbs baseball fans have now learned that the hidden ball trick is not just for infielders the first year of the contract between cbs and major league baseball has been a fiasco for the network the fans and the game as a lifelong baseball fan i hope that in the next round of negotiations for the broadcast rights to baseball major league baseball will consider factors about its suitors other than the size of their bids neal mcgarity burtonsville md
