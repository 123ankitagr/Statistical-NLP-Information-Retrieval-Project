internet devotees will get a gleam in their eye as they extol the joys of surfing the net the practice of wandering through the millions of data bases files and message groups proliferating on this selfregulating global web of computer networks and electronic mail systems travellers in this virtual world will tell you that almost anything is available on the internet sitting at their desks hacking away at their keyboards they can access recipes copies of national legislation or if theyre lucky soul mates lately some internet users have been able to find copies of wordprocessing programs or computer games some software is put on the system as freeware information that is in the public domain however copies of commercial software are also available without their high street price tags for less than the cost of an international phone call users are able to log on and download programs from the internet on to their own computers software authors the companies that sell the programs and governments view the growing practice of exchanging copyrighted software via the internet as computer piracy in a case now before the courts in the us the us attorneys office in boston massachusetts has indicted david lamacchia a student at the massachusetts institute of technology for conspiring to make an estimated dollars 1m in copyrighted business and entertainment computer software available on the internet between november 1993 and january 1994 lamacchia who is charged with criminal wire fraud is said to have operated a bulletin board service out of mit computer work stations he is alleged to have invited users around the world to post commercial software on to the bulletin board for exchange with other users the case which is up for further pleadings at the end of this month exposes the difficulty of prosecuting crimes under copyright infringement and fraud laws which were not set up to deal with developments in electronic communication lamacchia is protesting his innocence on the grounds that he did not personally copy any software on to the internet bulletin board but merely operated the system in which others made copies he is no more liable for what people do on the system than somebody who runs a telephone network is liable for what people say on the telephone said harvey silverglate a boston attorney representing lamacchia catching those who actually copied software from lamacchias bulletin board could be almost impossible you may not know who the people who are copying the material are or where they are from said mark sherwoodedwards a solicitor at simon olswang in london it would be difficult to say where the copyright infringement took place right now the laws are jurisdictional but the internet is global lamacchias lawyers believe the case should be dismissed because to try him would entail stretching and mangling us law they claim lamacchias alleged activities on the internet are not covered by the criminal statutes for copyright infringement or wire fraud harvard law school professor laurence tribe a specialist in us constitutional law and the legal ramifications of technology said inadequacy of current laws to deal with copyright infringement on the internet did not in principle create rights to free software on the other hand he said lamacchias case was being manipulated to fit existing statutes it seems like they are trying to fit a square into a round hole he said i think the situation calls for action at the legislative level rather than on a case by case trial software companies however believe they can cut down on internet piracy by going after individual cases last week we took down an internet bulletin board where our software was being copied said harrison colter a lawyer for novell a software manufacturer which recently merged with wordperfect the companies know that such policing will not get rid of software piracy altogether no one is naive enough to believe that copyright infringement can be eradicated from the internet said ed morin head of novells antipiracy team but we will aggressively go after pirates and if they think they can get away with it they need to know what the penalties can be it could be jail time or heavy civil fines
