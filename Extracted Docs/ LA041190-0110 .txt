Heinz Will Use Recyclable Plastic Bottles : H. J. Heinz Co. said it will begin making ketchup squeeze bottles from polyethylene terephthalate ( PET ) , which can be recycled , rather than the existing composite of polypropylene and adhesives . Environmentalists generally supported the move while cautioning that until plastic recycling markets are in place , the new bottles will continue to meet the fate of the old : burial in a landfill .
