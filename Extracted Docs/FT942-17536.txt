it was the kind of motoring few believe still possible and fewer have experienced the road well-graded signposted lavishly and mostly well-surfaced ran through ranges of rocky hills that changed colour by the minute it was almost free of traffic the sun blazed down from a cloudless sky and the open two-litre peugeot 306 cabriolet matched the mood perfectly i was in egypt driving down the west coast of the gulf of aqaba to sharm al-sheikh and the ras muhammad nature reserve on sinai's southern tip for most of the way the land is uninhabited on the straights with clear visibility for miles the peugeot ran safely up to its maximum 121 mph 195 kph on the winding passes it cornered as though glued to the tarmac the 123-horsepower engine singing sweetly in third and fourth in sharm al-sheikh itself a prudent 25 mph 40 kph or less was dictated by a combination of ferocious speed humps and locals unable to decide on which side of the road to drive but the peugeot's suspension dealt as capably with deep potholes as it had with the odd stretch of broken surface at high speed for the cabriolet peugeot has reinforced the 306 hatchback body shell heavily and tuned the suspension as a result the open body is so stiff that even on corrugated dirt roads the fascia did not shake i have known some open cars to shake so badly that the instruments became a blur on moderately rough surfaces the hood is super-efficient too unlock a pair of clips on the windscreen press a button and the top vanishes under an automatic pop-up panel in the rear deck there is not quite so much room in the back seat as in a 306 hatchback but for a cabriolet the boot is surprisingly wide and deep driving position and general dynamics the accurate power-assisted steering light gear shift powerful brakes and sure-footed handling are as good as one expects of a peugeot even at maximum speed hood and windows down your head feels in no danger of being blown off windows up and with an optional extra around pounds 100 air-deflecting mesh in place there is barely enough draught at modest speeds to ruffle the hair a hard top that fits over the folded-down hood during winter months will be offered later on the return leg i drove a 1.8 litre cabriolet it lacked just a little of the bigger car's muscle 103 hp against 123 but was just as enjoyable cornering as capably and riding the bumps a shade more comfortably than the squatter-tyred two-litre curiously the less-powerful model has slightly higher gearing but it drives just as flexibly at low speeds mainland european buyers will also be offered a 1.8 litre cabriolet with automatic transmission but britain initially at any rate will get only the two-litre manual which arrives in may and is likely to cost about pounds 17,000 peugeot expects to sell 1,000 a year in britain of the 306 cabriolets some will be bought by people who might otherwise have gone for posh escort astra golf renault 19 or rover 220 soft tops but peugeot also has the upmarket bmw 3-series and audi 80 convertibles in its sights and the 306 especially when topless looks so seductive that the 1,000 a-year forecast might turn out on the low side if the uk has a few decent summers the day before visiting sharm al-sheikh in the 306 cabriolets i drove a new 1.6 litre peugeot 106 griffe from aqaba in jordan to petra there i swopped it for a sure-footed little arab grey to ride down the narrow gorge to the ruins of the ancient city emerging to see the rose-red nabbatean treasury glowing theatrically in the sunshine was everything i had imagined it would be a moment of sheer magic driving north up the main highway from aqaba the griffe flew past articulated lorries groaning uphill and creeping cautiously down on the sinuous minor road to wadi musa and petra i found it urbane and entertaining for the return leg i tried the latest version of the sporty 106 xsi 1.6 engined like the griffe but with five more horsepower 95 against 90 and firmer suspension on balance i preferred the griffe it had all the handling and road-holding anyone could use responsibly on public roads plus the ride comfort of a much larger car aware that griffe and grief sound the same to britons but have different meanings peugeot will call the new luxury 106 the gentry when it arrives in september priced between pounds 11,000 and pounds 11,500 the xsi due in the uk in june will be just under pounds 11,000 a feature of the psa fiat multi-purpose vehicles the peugeot 806 among them unveiled at geneva show this column march 12 13 is a gear lever protruding not from the floor but the fascia its movement is exactly the same but the floor is left uncluttered having tried and liked it in a new peugeot boxer light commercial i think it could start a new fashion or thinking of the renault 4 and citroen 2 cv which had something similar it might revive a very old one
