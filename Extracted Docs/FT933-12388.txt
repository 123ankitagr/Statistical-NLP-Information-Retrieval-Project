HOUSE PRICES are unlikely to rise by more than 1 per cent this year and house sales are expected to be the second lowest since 1976 , according to stockbrokers UBS . Mr John Wriglesworth , housing analyst at the brokers , said the pace of recovery had slowed since the spring with new instructions and 'net sales' ( excluding those that fell through ) reported by estate agents falling sharply since they peaked in March . House prices rises of 3 per cent reported by the Halifax building society in March and April subsequently fell by 2.3 per cent in May and June . Mr Wriglesworth said he expected house sales in England and Wales to rise by 7 per cent to 1.2m this year . Recovery in the housing market was forecast to accelerate next year with prices rising by 7 per cent and transactions by 10 per cent . UBS said a future boom in house prices was unlikely as attitudes towards house purchases had changed . Nearly 2m people had seen the value of their house fall below the value of their mortgage . UBS said the number of people between 25 and 28 , the age at which many buy their first home , would fall sharply in the next 10 years , reducing the potential pool of first-time buyers by 30 per cent .
