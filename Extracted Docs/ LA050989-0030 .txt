A U.S. investigator in Texas said he suspected that the leader of a drug-smuggling and satanic cult could have faked his death to fool police into ending their hunt for perpetrators of 15 ritual murders near the U.S.-Mexico border . But Mexican authorities maintained that Adolfo de Jesus Constanzo had been positively identified by his fingerprints and U.S. passport . Cult member Alvaro de Leon has said he killed Constanzo and a bodyguard in a Mexico City apartment on the leader 's orders . But Armando Ramirez , resident agent of the Drug Enforcement Administration in Brownsville , said the bodies were too badly shot up to be positively identified .
