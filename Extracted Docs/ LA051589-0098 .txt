Movie producer Robert Evans won a crucial round today in his legal fight to avoid testifying about a murder linked to his movie , `` The Cotton Club . '' A judge who had threatened on Friday to jail Evans for contempt instead upheld his right to invoke Fifth Amendment protection against self-incrimination in the 1983 slaying of New York theatrical producer Roy Radin . However , Municipal Court Judge Patti Jo McKay added a proviso : Evans must answer whether he knew Radin , a question posed by the prosecutor last Friday .
