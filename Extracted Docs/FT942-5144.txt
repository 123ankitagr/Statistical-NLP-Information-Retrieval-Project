any way you look at it commodities are hot key indices of commodity prices have risen 3 per cent to 13 per cent this year and price appreciation in some markets such as coffee cotton or copper has outstripped lagging valuations in most government bond markets and many stock markets although commodities are far less important to the economy than they used to be they are suddenly the focus of world financial markets they are important as raw materials the stuff that economic expansions are built upon since many commodities are traded in public futures markets price increases show up more quickly and more dramatically than in other economic sectors statistics on employment gains or manufacturing orders tend to be reported with a lag and are slow to exhibit convincing trends the us federal reserve was clearly watching commodity prices as it lifted interest rates this spring seeking price stability in its efforts to head off inflation however commodities economists say are not reliable barometers of the magnitude of an inflationary cycle and historically have been only a semireliable indicator of inflations direction in the first quarters of 1992 and of 1993 for example prices of some physical commodities rose but levelled a quarter later and the us economy did not overheat as some observers had feared however with prices for soft commodities and grains near benchmark highs and base metals turning higher after bumping along in a decadelong supplyburdened trough the signals are much stronger several important inflation indices have begun a rare convergence the knightridder commodity research bureau index of 21 commodities which tends to reflect its heavy weighting of grain and soyabean prices has begun to track the journal of commerce index of industrial commodities a basket of raw materials that includes hemp cardboard cartons and plywood the goldman sachs commodity index which has a bias toward oil and other energy products has been trending higher whether rising commodity prices translate into inflation is another matter says mr samuel kahan chief economist for fuji securities he argues that global competition could act to keep inflation in check because commodities prices have been moving conversely to bonds money managers have begun to view the whole sector as an attractive new asset class that offers an inflation hedge and portfolio diversification these money managers comprise a new class of deeppocketed speculators in what have historically been relatively small and tightly held markets bankers and derivatives brokers are generating a plethora of new commoditylinked products and exchangetraded commodity markets are experiencing unprecedented volume rises the new commodity speculators tend not have or need a deep understanding of the fundamental supply and demand features of the commodity and their bent toward technical trading is changing the rules for traditional traders what we are seeing are large and unusually active speculators says mr donald mitchell a senior economist in the international trade division of the world bank and a commodities specialist this is a new demand class for futures a group of people who have no use for the commodity it could increase the prices of commodities over time but it does not mean there will be a corresponding increase in final demand what it does add is price volatility mr mitchell says
